1722,What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation. The canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA","[1993703, 6194440, 1712333, 2513486, 1915889, 7901430]","[1712333, 3996596, 1634521, 8015613]","The most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site (poly(A) signal) is AATAAA. This hexanucleotide sequence is usually associated with the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs.

2523,What causes Black Lung?,"Black lung, also known as pneumoconiosis, is caused by chronic exposure to coal dust.","[8199664, 8803434, 8456342, 6453959]","[8199664, 8803434, 6453959, 3047212]","Black Lung, also known as coal workers' pneumoconiosis, is caused by exposure to and retention of respirable coal dust in the lungs. This long-term accumulation of fine particles leads to the characteristic lung disease associated with coal mining.

3822,List as many European influenza vaccines as possible.,"Three split-virion vaccines (Vaxigrip, Begrivac, and Influsplit/Fluarix) and three subunit vaccines containing only viral surface glycoproteins (Influvac, Agrippal, and Fluvirin).",[8801083],"[2147615, 1901182, 7013291, 2110385]","The passage mentions several influenza vaccines available for the 1994-95 season. However, it does not specify if they are all European. Since the passage is about analyzing these vaccines, it's likely that some or all of them may be European, but this information isn't explicitly provided in the given context.
