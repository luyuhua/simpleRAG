9797,"New data on viruses isolated from patients with subacute thyroiditis de Quervain 
are reported. Characteristic morphological, cytological, some physico-chemical 
and biological features of the isolated viruses are described. A possible role 
of these viruses in human and animal health disorders is discussed. The isolated 
viruses remain unclassified so far."
11906,"We describe an improved method for detecting deficiency of the acid hydrolase, 
alpha-1,4-glucosidase in leukocytes, the enzyme defect in glycogen storage 
disease Type II (Pompe disease). The procedure requires smaller volumes of blood 
and less time than previous methods. The assay involves the separation of 
leukocytes by Peter's method for beta-glucosidase and a modification of Salafsky 
and Nadler's fluorometric method for alpha-glucosidase."
16083,"We have studied the effects of curare on responses resulting from iontophoretic 
application of several putative neurotransmitters onto Aplysia neurons. These 
neurons have specific receptors for acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, octopamine, 
phenylethanolamine, histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), aspartic acid, 
and glutamic acid. Each of these substances may on different specific neurons 
elicit at least three types of response, caused by a fast depolarizing Na+, a 
fast hyperpolarizing Cl-, or a slow hyperpolarizing K+ conductance increase. All 
responses resulting from either Na+ or Cl- conductance increases, irrespective 
of which putative transmitter activated the response, were sensitive to curare. 
Most were totally blocked by less than or equal to 10-4 M curare. GABA responses 
were less sensitive and were often only depressed by 10-3 M curare. K+ 
conductance responses, irrespective of the transmitter, were not curare 
sensitive. These results are consistent with a model of receptor organization in 
which one neurotransmitter receptor may be associated with any of at least three 
ionophores, mediating conductance increase responses to Na+, Cl-, and K+, 
respectively. In Aplysia nervous tissue, curare appears not to be a specific 
antagonist for the nicotinic ACh receptor, but rather to be a specific blocking 
agent for a class of receptor-activated Na+ and Cl- responses."
23188,"Kinetic and electrophoretic properties of 230--300 fold purified preparations of 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from red cells of donors and patients 
with acute drug hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency were studied. A new 
abnormal variant of G6PD isolated from red cell of a patient with acute drug 
hemolytic anemia, which was not described in literature, has been discovered. 
The abnormal enzyme differs from the normal by decreased Michaelis constant for 
glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), by 
increased utilization of analogues of substrates--2-deoxy-glucose-6-phosphate 
and particularly deamino-NADP, by low thermal stability, by the character of 
pH-dependence, by the appearance of a single band of G6PD activity in 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
23469,"Male Wistar specific-pathogen-free rats aged 2, 7, 17, 30, 60, 120, 200, 360 and 
600 days, all killed in experiment on the same day, were examined. The body 
weight significantly increased until the 200th day, the weight of adrenals until 
the 120th day and the adrenal protein content until the 30th day of life. The 
adrenaline content of the adrenals increased continuously during the 600 days 
studied. Adrenal noradrenaline content increased rapidly over the first 17 days, 
remained at a stable level until the 120th day, and rose to a higher level after 
200 days. The activity of adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes also 
increased with age: tyrosine hydroxylase gradually increased until the 360th 
day, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase until 
the 200th day. Our results demonstrate that, in the rat, during development 
there is a gradual increase of adrenal weight, adrenaline content, tyrosine 
hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase activity until 
maturation (120th day), whereas the adrenal noradrenaline content reaches the 
adult values earlier, around the 17th day. During aging, adrenal catecholamines 
significantly increase when compared to young-adult rats (120-day-old), probably 
due to the elevated activity of the adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes. 
The increased adrenal catecholamine levels in old animals might be connected 
with a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in aged."
24032,"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) 
activities were assayed in adrenal glands of the following groups of the Alaskan 
red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus dawsoni): 1) laboratory reared at 20 
degrees C and 2) exposed to 5 degrees C for 1, 3, 7, and 28 days; 3) wild, 
summer acclimatized; 4) wild, fall acclimatized; and 5) wild, winter 
acclimatized. TH activity in laboratory-acclimated voles exposed to 5 degrees C 
was increased by 2 times after 3 days and remained elevated after 28 days. PNMT 
activity in these same voles was increased after 7 days and also remained 
elevated after 28 days of cold exposure. In wild-acclimatized voles TH activity 
and PNMT activity in summer were equivalent to levels in 28-day cold-acclimated 
laboratory voles. In fall, TH activity was increased to 2.5 times the summer 
value. It decreased by midwinter, but remained elevated above the summer level. 
In contrast, PNMT activity appeared unchanged from summer through fall and 
winter. Pregnant summer voles had markedly increased TH activity. Adrenal 
norepinephrine and epinephrine did not change significantly with cold 
acclimation or seasonal acclimatization. Thus, acclimatization of wild voles to 
fall and winter conditions involved aquisition of a greater capacity to 
synthesize adrenal catecholamines than that produced by exposing 
laboratory-reared voles to an extended period of cold."
30666,"Hemolytic anemia is a well-recognized complication of sulfasalazine treatment. 
17 of 40 (43%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving sulfasalazine 
had evidence of hemolysis as detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Only 47% 
(8) of patients with hemolysis had Heinz body formation. The hemoglobin was 
significantly reduced in patients with hemolysis and 53% had a reticulocyte 
count of greater than 5%. A significant correlation was noted between hemolysis 
and serum sulfapyridine level, but no correlation was seen with serum 
sulfasalazine level. There was no significant difference in disease extent or 
activity in patients with hemolysis compared to those without hemolysis. 
Hemolysis is not a rare side-effect of sulfasalazine therapy. Heinz body 
formation is not invariably found in sulfasalazine-induced hemolysis."

61441,"Mice were inoculated with human sarcoid tissue homogenates or with a first or a 
second passage homogenate of mouse tissue (including 0.2 mum membrane filtrates) 
originating from the inoculation of human sarcoid, Crohn's disease, or control 
tissue homogenates. Epithelioid and giant cell granulomas were present in the 
footpads and/or viscera of some of the mice given homogenates originating from 
each sarcoid or Crohn's disease tissue 15 months after inoculation but were not 
present in mice given control homogenates. Among mice given homogenates 
originating from human sarcoidosis, granulomas were present in many organs and 
tissues; in contrast, a pattern of selective dissemination of visceral 
granulomas was found among mice given homogenates originating from Crohn's 
disease. This differential distribution of visceral granulomas also followed the 
inoculation of 0.2 mum membrane filtrates. Granulomatous responses at Kveim test 
sites in the ear 9-17 months after inoculation of homogenatesoriginating from 
human sarcoidosis or Crohn's disease were confined to mice showing granulomas in 
footpads of viscera. The ability of the transmissible agents to induce 
granulomas in mice was destroyed when sarcoid or Crohn's tissues were autoclaved 
or when sarcoid homogenates were stored at -20degreesC for 1 week or exposed to 
60Co irradiation (2.5 MR)."

134458,"4103 cases suspected of mycoses were analysed as to sex, age and site of disease 
and 3891 were proved cases. This group formed 50% of total mycoses or 13-93% of 
all dermatoses recorded in the Government General Hospital, Madras, during the 
period of study. There were 66-26% adult female, 27-6% adult male and 6-14% were 
below 13 years. Dermatophytoses were found in 73-5%; the other common diseases 
were tinea versicolor (17-68%) and candidiasis (12-43%). Multiple sites of 
involvement or more than 1 disease in the same individual were mostly observed. 
The incidence of piedra (0-1%) and deep mycoses (0-156%) was very low. Mycetoma 
was the common disease (5/6) in deep mycoses. In dermatophytoses, tinea corporis 
(49-71%) and tinea cruris (47-85%) commonest; tinea axillaris (3-42%), tinea 
capitis (1-72%) and tinea barbae (1-29%) were less common. The incidence of 
tinea manuum, tinea pedis and tinea unguium was similar (4-97%-6-38%). High 
temperature and humidity were related to the higher incidence of tinea corporis, 
tinea cruris and tinea versicolor. Mainly children suffered from tinea capitis. 
All other mycoses were commonly found in adults between 2nd and 3rd decades. In 
all mycoses but candidiasis, female predominated. Cutaneous candidiasis was 
mainly a problem of housewives. Among the dermatophytes Trichophyton violaceum 
was predominant (33-7%) followed by T. rubrum (32-6%). Trichophyton schoenleinii 
and M. gypseum were rarely isolated. From mycetoma, Madurella mycetomii, 
Nocardia braziliensis, N. asteroides and Actinomadura spp. were isolated. 
Demonstration of Cryptococcus laurentii in 1 case is reported in this area for 
the first time."
135896,"This paper reports about a female mutational falsetto, that means an unusual 
high (309 Hz base frequency) fundamental frequency of the speaking voice in a 
19-year-old girl. The psychological background and the epicrisis as well as the 
practical negative result of the hormon- and metabolism examination allow the 
diagnosis of this rare disturbance of the voice, the formal classification of 
which would on the other hand also allow the statement of a phononeurosis with a 
too high fundamental frequency of the speaking voice because the behavior of the 
voice from the menarche (12 years) up to the first examination does not seem 
assured definately. The individual median fundamental frequency of the speaking 
voice has inally been obtained at 270 Hz. Energy range of the speaking voice has 
been measured, glottography and sonagraphy has been carried out, all of which 
show the course of treatment clearly. It has been remarked critically that there 
has to be found a method to better reproduce the hearing impression in a figure. 
Investigations according to this have been made."
152622,"Animal experiments suggest that opiate peptides might play a role in 
extrapyramidal function. This hypothesis was tested by administering the opiate 
antagonist, naltrexone, in doses sufficient to antagonize exogenous opiates, to 
patients with parkinsonism and Huntington's disease. No improvement in the 
clinical features of either disorder was noted."
159767,"Certain drugs are transformed into reactive metabolites by cytochrome P-450, a 
hepatic microsomal enzyme. The reactive metabolites covalently bind to 
hepatocyte macromolecules, thus determining liver lesions. Induction of 
microsomial enzymes increases the formation of reactive metabolites and 
exaggerates hepatotoxicity of these drugs."
164278,"Protein methylase III (S-adenosylmethionine:proteinlysine methyltransferase; ED 
2.1.1.25) and protein methylase I (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-arginine 
methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.23) activities were examined in isolated nuclei and 
cytosol fraction, respectively, from various hepatomas with different growth 
rates. The enzyme activities of both enzymes paralleled the rates of tumor 
growth in fast- and moderately growing hepatomas. The parallelism was more 
evident with protein methylase I than with protein methylase III. While protein 
methylase III activity was elevated in the fast- to moderately growing 
hepatomas, the enzyme that is responsible for demethylating proteins, 
epsilon-alkyllysinase (epsilon-slkyl-L-lysine:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 
1.5.3.4), had an inverse relationship to the rate of tumor growth, thus 
suggesting a possible physiological antagonism. When isolated rat liver nuclei 
were methylated in vitro with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-14 C]methionine as methyl 
donor, H2SO4-insoluble protein and histones had almost equal amounts of 
methyl-14 C incorporated. However, amino acid analysis revealed that methylated 
arginines are the predominant form of radioactivity in the H2SO4-insoluble 
protein (product of protein methylase I), while methylated lysines are the major 
methylated amino acids in the histones (product of protein methylase III). 
Furthermore, the hydrolysate of the H2SO4-insoluble protein showed four unknown 
radioactivity peaks on the amino acid analyzer in addition to the known 
methylated arginine and lysine derivatives."
169249,"The thyrotropin receptor from bovine thyroid plasma membranes has been 
solubilized using lithium diiodosalicylate, and an assay to measure thyrotropin 
binding to the solubilized receptor has been developed. Both the solubilized 
thyrotropin receptor and the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid plasma membranes 
have effectively identical nonlinear Scatchard plots and negatively sloped Hill 
plots, i.e. both preparations have receptors which appear to exhibit a similar 
negatively cooperative relationship. Although the pH optimum of thyrotropin 
binding to the solubilized receptor is the same as that of the thyroid plasma 
membrane receptor, pH 6.0, the pH dependency curve of the solubilized receptor 
is slightly different in its outline. Thyrotropin binding to the solubilized 
receptor is less sensitive to salt inhibition than is binding to the thyroid 
plasma membrane receptor; however, optimal binding remains at 0 degrees. The 
relative affinities of thyrotropin and two glycoprotein hormones which can be 
considered structural analogs, luteinizing hormone and human chorionic 
gonadotropin, are 100:10:5, respectively, toward plasma membrane receptors, but 
100:25:40 toward the solubilized receptors. The solubilized receptor preparation 
is heterogeneous in size in that it has binding components with molecular 
weights of 286,000, 160,000, 75,000, and 15,000 to 30,000. Tryptic digestion 
converts all three higher molecular weight components to the 15,000 to 30,000 
molecular weight species, and the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor 
component has all of the binding properties of the solubilized receptor 
preparation before tryptic digestion including an identical nonlinear Scatchard 
plot. It has the same size as and coelutes from Sephadex G-100 with a 15,000 to 
30,000 molecular weight receptor released by tryptic digestion of bovine thyroid 
plasma membranes or tryptic digestion of bovine or dog thyroid cells in culture. 
The tryptic fragment of the solubilized receptor or preparations has been 
purified almost 250-fold by affinity chromatography on thyrotropin-Sepharose 
columns. The binding activity is lost when the solubilized thyrotropin receptor 
preparation is exposed to beads of neuraminidase-Sepharose or conconavalin 
A-Sepharose."
178234,"The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune 
response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune 
response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such 
as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally 
into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. 
Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when 
administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, 
but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal 
residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph 
nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity 
is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. 
However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; 
consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such 
as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy 
for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It 
is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this 
effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve 
maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be 
combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man, 
it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms 
would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from 
human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant."
179993,"Previous studies have shown that cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with 
genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase (i. e. the Wolman Syndrome and 
Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease) are defective in their ability to hydrolyze 
the cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). As a 
result, these mutant cells show a reduced responsiveness to the regulatory 
actions of LDL, as evidenced by a decreased LDL-mediated suppression of the 
activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and by a decreased 
LDL-mediated activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. In the current 
studies, the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells were 
grown in the same Petri dish with mutant fibroblasts derived from a patient with 
the homozygous form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Whereas pure monolayers of 
either the Familial Hypercholesterolemia cells (lacking cell surface LDL 
receptors) or the acid lipase-deficient cells (lacking cholesteryl ester 
hydrolase activity) responded poorly to LDL, the mixed monolayers developed 
lipoprotein responsiveness as measured by an enhancement of both LDL-mediated 
suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and 
LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. This effect was shown 
to result from the release of the lysosomal acid lipase from the Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia homozygote cells into the culture medium and its subsequent 
uptake by the acid lipase-deficient cells. The acquisition of this acid lipase 
activity enhanced the ability of the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester 
Storage Disease cells to respond to the lipoprotein by suppression of 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and activation of cellular 
cholesteryl ester formation. These data emphasize the importance of the 
lysosomal acid lipase in the cellular metabolism of LDL cholesteryl esters and, 
in addition, demonstrate that delivery of this enzyme to genetically deficient 
cells can enhance the regulatory response to the lipoprotein."
187357,"Addition of exogen DB-c AMP in medium of human fibroblasts culture, with 46 XX 
karyotypes, enables us to observe a high frequency of Barr bodies, about 80 or 
85%. This observation suggests that the condensation of the X chromosome in the 
form of Barr bodies depends on the level of endogen cyclic AMP."
192600,"Nine active neurohypophyseal principles have been isolated and identified among 
the vertebrates. Arginine-vasotocin is the most ubiquitous, occurring in 
pituitary glands from representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. There 
is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin. 
The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates 
smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate 
contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like 
peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals 
arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less 
oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts 
and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic 
functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. 
Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive 
vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine 
whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is 
possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to 
cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its 
osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution."
196592,"A protein methylase III responsible for specifically methylating the cytochrome 
c in Neurospora crassa was partially characterized by using unmethylated horse 
heart cytochrome c as a substrate. This enzyme utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
as the methyl donor. An analysis of the distribution of [14C]methyl groups in 
the peptides obtained by chymotrypsin digestion of the enzymically methylated 
cytochrome c showed that all of the radioactivity could be recovered within a 
single peak after chromatography. This indicates that the enzyme methylates a 
specific amino acid sequence within cytochrome c. On hydrolysis of the 
radioactive chymotryptic peptide, Me-14C-labelled epsilon -N-mono-methyl-lysine, 
epsilon-N-dimethyl-lysine and epsilon-N-trimethyl-lysine were identified. The 
enzyme can easily be extracted from the N. crassa mycelial pads and was purified 
approx. 30-fold."
204459,"De novo purine biosynthesis has been studied in lymphocyte cell lines 
established from Lesch-Nyhan patients deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), in in vitro differentiating erythroleukaemic 
cell lines cloned from cells charactistic of virus-induced murine leukaemia, and 
in mutant hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase. The 
relationship between cellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) 
metabolism and the activity of the enzymes which catalyse the early steps of de 
novo purine biosynthesis has been explored. It was found that hamster cells 
deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase did not accumulate PP-ribose-P as do 
HGPRT-deficient cells. In these model systems, an accelerated rate of de novo 
purine biosynthesis tended to be associated with an increase in cellular 
PP-ribose-P cotent, but decreases in this rate results from the reduction in the 
activity of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Regulation of ammonia-dependent de 
novo purine biosynthesis was similar to that of glutamine-dependent purine 
biosynthesis."
207959,"14 previously untreated patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa according to 
Fredrickson underwent a controlled clinical trial. The study was designed to 
clarify the effects of clofibrate on the bloodlipids. All patients were willing 
to cooperate. After leaving their usual dietary habits all of them were given 
for seven to ten days a ""prudent"" diet. This diet was rich in vitamins; it had a 
low caloric-content. 20% of the calories consisted of proteins, 35% of 
carbohydrates (sweets were omitted) and about 45% of fats with a PS-factor of 
about 2.2. After the initial dietary treatment all patients were given twice 
daily for 14 days 500 mg clofibrate. During the use of the ""prudent"" diet the 
serum-cholesterol-levels decreased in average with 14.8%. Compared to the values 
at the beginning of the trial the difference was statistically highly 
significant. The average-values of triglycerides, phosphatides and the relative 
percentage of HDL, LDL and VLDL remained unchanged. After the patients received 
clofibrate there was an additional decrease of the serum-cholesterol-values of 
14.8%. The total decrease of the cholesterol-levels compared to the initial 
values amounted to 27.4%. Furthermore, there was a reduction of the phosphatids 
in the serum of 14.1% compared to the initial value and of 9.9% compared to the 
value after dietary treatment alone. Under the combined effects of a ""prudent"" 
diet with clofibrate the HDL increased significantly. It can be assumed that 
clofibrate reduces the serum-cholesterol-levels in cases of hyperlipoproteinemia 
by decreasing the LDL-fraction, which is rich in cholesterol, and by increasing 
the HDL-fraction."
211577,"A material of 89 cases of upper extremity deformities, among the 3225 cleft 
patients born during the period 1950-75, and treated in the Finnish Red Cross 
Cleft Centre is presented. About two-thirds of the patients had an isolated 
cleft palate--half of the male and nearly all of the female patients. The 
percentage of upper extremity deformities appearing with the different types of 
the orofacial clefts was, for clefts of the primary palate 2.0: specifically for 
cleft lip 0.8, cleft lip--palate 2.6, and cleft lip and palate 3.6; and for 
clefts of the secondary palate 3.5: specifically for cleft palate 3.7, submucous 
cleft palate 1.6; and for the branchial arch syndrome (lateral cleft) 5.2; the 
total average being 2.8 percent. About one-third of the patients were dwarfs, 
most of them diastrophic dwarfs. Syndactyly was somewhat more common among cleft 
patients, 0.3%, than in the average population. Polydactyly, 0.1% was about as 
common as the average. Ectrodactyly was more common among cleft patients, 0.4%, 
than either syndactyly or polydactyly that are considered the most common hand 
deformities among the general population. The syndactyly cases were more 
complicated than the average, among them 4 cases of Apert syndrome were noted. 
About three-fourths of the 89 patients had multiple deformities."
213536,"Three patients are described in whom irradiation of 2750 rad or more was used in 
the management of primary brain tumours, and 21 years or more later a second 
brain tumour of a different type occurred. One of the new tumours was a 
meningioma and the other two were cerebral astrocytomas. There is evidence to 
show that moderate doses of ionising radiations given in childhood for tinea 
capitis are associated with a late risk of developing a meningioma. Higher doses 
of radiation used for tumours in childhood are followed also by a late hazard of 
meningioma. There is insufficient evidence to implicate ionising radiations in 
the aetiology of gliomas. The oncogenic hazards of radiotherapy to the brain do 
not outweigh its therapeutic value in brain tumour."
215035,"The energy relationships between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism were 
studied in the hearts from euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. 
Isolated mitochondria showed high respiratory control ratios and impermeability 
to exogenous NADH. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, resulted in lower 
and higher contents of both cytochromes per mitochondrion and mitochondrial 
protein per gram of wet weight of heart without changes in the ratio of 
cytochrome c to cytochrome aa3. In isolated perfused heart, the hyperthyroid 
state led to an increase in work rate and thereby an elevation of Vo2, which 
resulted in an increase oxidation-reduction turnover number for the cytochromes. 
An agreement was found between [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] of cytosolic free adenine 
nucleotides and the value calculated from a mathematical model of mitochondrial 
respiration. This implies that mitochondrial respiration is controlled at the 
cytochrome oxidase reaction and that oxidative phosphorylation in intact tissue 
is tightly coupled irrespective of thyroid state. It is concluded that thyroid 
hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome 
content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of 
oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation."
216895,"If patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa are treated with diet and 
additionally over a period of two weeks with 2 grams of Clofibrate daily, the 
cholesterol-level in the serum decreases. This decrease is caused mainly by a 
reduction of the apolipoprotein B and the LDL-cholesterol in serum. If elevated 
cholesterol-levels in the serum are reduced through a ""prudent"" diet, the 
concentration of apolipoprotein B in serum remains the same. It is not fully 
understood which influence a diet, which is rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids 
and has a low content of saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates, has upon the 
lipoproteins in the serum. The mode of action of this diet and its significance 
for the concentration of HDL need further investigation."
273896,"Pyrimidine-purine DNAs with repeating sequences can be made to undergo a 
reversible transition to possibly a tetra-stranded complex. Physicochemical

of d(GA)n to the remaining space in the major groove of the triple-stranded 
complex d(TC)n-d(GA)n-d(CT)n. A possible role for tetra-stranded complexes in 
chromosome condensation is suggested by the natural occurrence of repeating 
sequence pyrimidine-purine DNAs and the properties of condensed chromosomes."
281140,"Since experimental and clinical evidence supports some role of musculature in 
determining the form and size of facial bones during the active periods of 
growth after birth, this study addresses the same basic relationships between 
muscle and bone during the periods of active growth before birth. The 
relationship between the masseter muscle and the mandible, including its ramal 
and body components, was chosen as the model for study in nineteen human fetuses 
(ages 16 to 36 weeks). Cross-sectional cephalometric data indicated that, 
although increases in the size of the muscle and mandible were linearly related 
to increasing age, the ramal portion of the mandible was more closely related to 
changes in the masseter muscle than to changes in the mandibular body. Moreover, 
it appears that reorientation of the muscle anteriorly and downward precedes a 
similar reorientation of the ramus, with the combination of both fetal events 
leading to the typical relationships of the two structures expected after birth. 
Although this study does not get to cause-and-effect relationships, and although 
the fetal specimens cannot be monitored longitudinally over time, the 
parallelisms between our prenatal findings and those reported for postnatal 
periods certainly lend further support to the observation that many aspects of 
morphogenesis and growth are continual processes spanning the periods on either 
side of birth."
287325,"Various methods of diagnosing allergic factors in chronic rhinitis are 
discussed. Among the procedures which aim at detecting specific allergens, i.e. 
skin testing, RAST, and nasal provocation tests, the last mentioned, as they are 
performed directly on the shock organ, have so far been found to give the most 
accurate picture of clinically dominant allergens and of the intensity and 
character of the rhinitis. However, information obtained by analysing the 
correlations between different procedures is not unanimous. As long as test 
techniques and allergen extracts have not been standardized, one particular test 
cannot be recommended as the method of choice."
305444,"B cells that carry the complement receptor (CR+) were separated from B cells 
that lack the complement receptor (CR-) by velocity sedimentation or by passage 
through C-coated Sephadex columns. The kinetics of responses to bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both B cell subpopulations were determined in three 
assay procedures: 1) incorporation of radioactive thymidine into DNA; 2) 
incorporation of radioactive leucine into immunoglobulin; 3) enumeration of 
cells forming polyclonal antibody to the 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl hapten. Although 
both subpopulations of B cells responded to LPS, they differed in the time 
course. CR- B cells responded with a delay of approximately 24 hr as compared 
with the response of CR+ B cells. The implications to the ontogenetic status of 
CR+ and CR- B subpopulations are discussed."
308321,"A 12-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman had bilateral optic disk hypoplasia 
and bitemporal hemianopia. By using computed axial tomography on our patients, 
we demonstrated the absence of the septum pellucidum, which confirmed the 
diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia, or the de Morsier syndrome."
308705,"Acute purulent pericarditis was treated successfully in five children between 
the ages of 27 months and 11 1/2 years during the past 5 years. The responsible 
organism was Hemophilus influenzae, type b, in two cases and Meningococcus, 
Pneumococcus, and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in one case each. No 
primary source of infection could be identified in two patients. A high index of 
suspicion, combined with immediate echocardiograms and pericardiocentesis, led 
to the diagnosis. Immediate antibiotic therapy was instituted on the basis of 
the gram stain of the pericardial fluid. All five patients had a pericardial 
window established--four through subxyphoid approach and the fifth, because of a 
left pleural effusion, through a left thoracotomy. When the subxyphoid approach 
was used, sump drains were left for postoperative suction and irrigation. All 
five patients survived without sequalae during follow-up periods of from 18 
months to 5 years. We advocate an aggressive approach to the diagnosis and 
treatment of this problem. This report documents the safety, ease, and 
effectiveness of the subxyphoid approach as a means of drainage."
313731,"A case of a nine year and eight months old child with Kartagener's syndrome 
(triad) is described: chronic maxillary sinusitis, bronchiectasis and ""situs 
inversus totalis"". Literature is reviewed. It is important to understand 
genetical and etiology aspects of bronchiectasis. Diagnosis was considered on 
the basis of physical and radiographic examination."
323424,"The effect of haloperidol and apomorphine, and both drugs in combination, on the 
first steps in the synthesis of catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 
has been studied in three rat brain regions. The rate of formation of dopa and 
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was studied by measuring the accumulation of these 
amino acids during 30 min after administration of the inhibitor of the aromatic 
L-amino acid decarboxylase, NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl). Haloperidol 
caused an increase in dopa and no change in 5-HTP formation. The threshold dose 
was severalfold higher in the noradrenaline-predominated hemisphere portion than 
in the dopamine-rich striatal and limbic regions, suggesting a higher affinity 
of haloperidol for dopamine than for noradrenaline receptors. Apomorphine caused 
a decrease in dopa formation in all three brain regions studied, although the 
effect was much more pronounced in the regions dominated by dopamine. The 
threshold dose was about 30 microng/kg, i.e. an order of magnitude lower than 
the threshold dose for apparent postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor activation. 
This discrepancy is suggested to be due to preferential activation of inhibitory 
dopaminergic autoreceptors by low apomorphine doses. This phenomenon may also 
contribute to explain the complex dose-response curves of apomorphine. Low doses 
of apomorphine caused a decrease and high doses an increase in 5-HTP formation. 
These effects, like those on noradrenaline synthesis, are suggested to be 
secondary to activation of dopaminergic pre- and post-synaptic receptors. The 
interaction between apomorphine and haloperidol with respect to dopa formation 
appears to be largely explicable on the assumption of a competition between an 
agonist and an antagonist for dopaminergic receptors. However, very large doses 
of apomorphine cause a haloperidol-resistant inhibition of tyrosine, and 
probably also tryptophan, hydroxylation, which may be due to a direct inhibition 
of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase involved."
324229,"A variety of anomalies of the central nervous system are observed in trisomy 18. 
The present case describes an infant having a type II Arnold-Chiari malformation 
without spina bifida. One previous case of an Arnold-Chiari malformation was 
reported in trisomy 18 but that infant also had a lumbar meningomyelocoele. 
Abnormalities of cerebral gyration, hydrocephalus, and agenesis of the corpus 
callosum were also found in the present case."
331948,"Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with 
sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on 
these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter 
electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. Sleep 
was characterized by marked sinus arrhythmia in 14, extreme sinus bradycardia ( 
less than 30 beats/minute) in six, asystole of 2.5 to 6.3 seconds in five, 
second degree atrioventricular (A-V) block in two, and ventricular 
arrhythmias--complex premature ventricular beats in 10 and ventricular 
tachycardia in two. Arrhythmias during wakefulness were limited to premature 
ventricular beats in six. Atropine administration was partially and tracheostomy 
highly effective in preventing the majority of these arrhythmias during sleep. 
Marked sinus arrhythmia during sleep is characteristic of the syndrome of 
obstructive sleep apnea and is frequently accompanied by potentially 
life-threatening tachy- and bradyarrhythmias. Possible mechanism of production 
of these arrhythmias, the mode of action of tracheostomy and atropine, and the 
probable role of similar arrhythmias in the sudden infant death syndrome are 
discussed."
349563,"An endonuclease having EcoRI specificity is produced by bacteria containing the 
ColE1 plasmid. Such bacterial cells fail to express restriction or modification 
functions in vivo, and phage or plasmid DNA obtained from ColE1-containing cells 
has unmodified EcoRI sites that are cleaved in vitro by purified EcoRI 
endonuclease or by enzyme extracted from bacteria that carry ColE1. No EcoRI DNA 
methylase activity associated with ColE1 has been detected. The finding of 
phenotypically cryptic ColE1-dependent EcoRI endonuclease activity and the 
absence of any detectable EcoRI modification system in ColE1-containing cells 
suggest a control mechanism that appears to prevent functional expression of the 
ColE1-determined enzyme in vivo."
402951,"1. The temperature function of the myeloma IgG(K) IVA, Bence-Jones protein 
(K-type) IVA and its fragments (Fab(t), Fc'(t), VL and CL) was studied by 
thermal perturbation difference spectroscopy and circular dichroism. 2. The IgG 
and Bence-Jones protein studied were found to be capable of a fully reversible 
structural changes at temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C. The changes 
occurring at the higher temperature are accompanied by the screening of the 
significant part of exposed tyrosine residues. The transition is not accompanied 
by an appreciable change in the main IgG secondary structure-beta-pleated sheet, 
according to the CD data. 3. It was found that the temperature-dependent changes 
of IgG occur in its Fab fragments, the changes of Bence-Jones protein occur in 
its variable part (VL domains). 4. The temperature changes in the interval 25-35 
degrees C are explained by the flexibility of amino acid side chains composed 
hypervariable loops delineated the ""sides"" of cavity between variable domains."
409284,"Profound iduronate sulfatase deficiency, characteristic of the Hunter syndrome, 
has been found in cultured fibroblasts, serum, lymphocytes, and tissues of two 
clinically affected girls. The patients are karyotypically normal and have 
normal fathers; cloning of the mothers' fibroblasts did not reveal the mosaicism 
expected of carriers of an X-linked disease. Homozygosity for a previously 
unsuspected autosomal recessive gene for iduronate sulfatase is considered the 
most likely explanation, although heterozygosity for the X-linked gene and 
subsequent selection cannot be completely excluded."
417541,"A 3-year-old child diagnosed as having acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), developed 
meningeal leukemia 36 months after the onset of the disease. He was twice 
subjected to cranial irradiation plus intrathecal methotrexate (i.t. MTX). Skull 
radiology showed bilateral gyriform calcification of both cerebral hemispheres. 
Hematological relapse was first detected 5 years after diagnosis and the child 
died 5 months later. The most striking findings of a right frontal lobe biopsy 
and the postmortem examination were wide calcium deposits located in the cortex 
and in the adjacent white matter. Intense demyelination as well as areas of 
neuron poverty were apparent in the necropsy but in the biopsy specimen. The 
possible interrelationship between such deposition and cranial irradiation 
and/or i.t. MTX suggests a new iatrogenic disorder."
422845,"Nutritional factors in the aetiology of coronary heart disease, maturity-onset 
diabetes, diverticular disease and dental caries are discussed. Four principles 
for a prudent diet are suggested, namely: avoid excess intake of energy, 
increase dietary fibre intake, reduce total fat intake to approximately 30 per 
cent of energy intake, take a high proportion of fat as the polyunsaturated 
form."
443639,"X-linked familial hypophosphatemic rickets (X.L.F.H.R.) is one of the D 
resistant rickets. The inheritance pattern is related to the X chromosome. Most 
constant feature is hypophosphatemia. Pathogenesis is still a subject of 
controversy. There are three main theories: a) An abnormal vitamin D metabolism. 
b) Secondary hyperparathyroidism developping as a result of the diminished 
calcium absorption by gut. c) A primary deffect of phosphate transport al 
various levels. Authors study and comment six cases of X.L.F.H.R., three of 
which belong to the same family. Clinical, radiological and higtological 
findings correspond to those of severe rickets. It is a chronic disease which 
affects children during growth period, giving rise to deforming bones 
invalidism. Treatment consists on continuous administration of oral phosphate 
and vitamin D."
452602,"An open cross-over study of 20 patients with Parkinson's disease performed with 
two drugs containing L-dopa and a peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 
inhibitor (benserazide, carbidopa) confirmed the conclusions reached in other 
clinical trials that this combined treatment of Parkinson's disease is the most 
effective form of drug therapy available at present. With both drugs, Madopar or 
Sinemet, an optimum therapeutic result was obtained with relatively small doses 
of L-dopa (the reduction in L-dopa dosage amounting to about 80%). A loss of 
efficacy with both drugs, which has observed during long-term treatment of 
patients with Parkinson's disease, could be avoided by switching the patients 
from Sinemet to Madopar and vice versa. Determination of L-dopa in the plasma 
demonstrated that with either drug similar plasma levels of L-dopa were achieved 
during clinically effective treatment."
453349,"Pseudodementia is the syndrome in which dementia is mimicked or caricatured by 
functional psychiatric disorders. The author describes 10 patients with 
pseudodementia and compares its clinical features with those of true dementia. 
The syndrome occurred in patients with various psychiatric diagnoses, but a 
striking feature in most patients was marked dependency. The recognition of this 
clinical syndrome should obviate the need for many neurological diagnostic 
studies and lead to earlier and more effective psychiatric treatment."
457357,"The contrast sensitivity function of both eyes of subjects with functional 
amblyopia has been measured. A clinically significant difference was found 
between the amblyopic and the normal eye. It appears that the functionally 
amblyopic eye takes more information from the peripheral parts of the stimulus 
than does the normal eye. The sensitivity of the normal eye increases linearly 
with increasing width of the stimulus to show a knee at a certain number of 
grating lines, whereafter the sensitivity remains constant. The sensitivity of 
the amblyopic eye initially rises much faster than that of the normal eye with 
increasing stimulus width. In the amblyopic eye, there is no definite linear 
relationship between width of stimulus and the contrast sensitivity and no 
definite knee in the curve at which maximum sensitivity is reached."
464793,"The Zieve's syndrome consists of the transient association of cholestatic 
jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hyperlipemia, in a chronic alcoholic. The Authors, 
after a short introduction regarding physiopathological problems, describe and 
subsequently examine on the clinical ground a recent personal observation, which 
had been mentioned for the rarene-s of this disease."
475444,"Acneform lesions strictly confined to a Becker's nevus were observed in a 
18-year-old man. Histologically, a granulomatous folliculitis with partial 
destruction of the epithelial root sheath and follicular cysts with focal 
penetration of keratin into the surrounding dermis were present, ruling out acne 
vulgaris. The concept of Becker's nevus as a complex nevogenic process, 
affecting ectodermal, neuroectodermal, and mesenchymal structures, also in terms 
of dysfunction of the pilary complex, is suggested."
475965,"The incidences of malignant melanoma recorded by 59 population-based cancer 
registries were investigated to determine the effects of racial and skin-colour 
differences. White populations exhibited a wide range of melanoma incidences and 
females commonly, though not invariably, had a higher incidence than males. 
Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma 
although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. No predominant sex 
difference emerged among non-whites. Populations of African descent were found 
to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded 
that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the 
sole of the foot. A clear negative correlation between degree of skin 
pigmentation and melanoma incidence emerged for the exposed body sites. These 
data provide strong support for the hypotheses that UV radiation is a major 
cause of malignant melanoma and that melanin pigmentation protects against it. 
Further research is required to elucidate the aetiology of melanoma of the sole 
of the foot."
527972,"The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and 
five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, 
and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal 
karyotypes. In the carriers of 15/21 translocation, the number of large 
associations (involving more than two acrocentrics) and the association 
frequencies for individual acrocentric chromosomes, were significantly higher 
than in the control group. The mean number of associations of the single 
homologs of the translocation chromosomes was much higher than that of the other 
acrocentrics. In the carriers of 13/14 translocations, only the association 
frequency for chromosome 13 was higher than in the normal relatives. The 
uninvolved chromosomes homologous to those involved in translocation showed an 
insignificant increase in associations in comparison with the other 
acrocentrics. These results suggest that some mechanism within the cells 
compensates for the effect of missing acrocentrics or of acrocentrics lacking 
NORs on the number of associations. The possible relations of this phenomenon to 
the activity of the nucleolus organizing regions are discussed."
529328,"A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Unusually, 
the lung involvement preceded the salivary disease by more than two years. The 
initial gammopathy and abnormal serologies are more consistent with 
uncomplicated Sjogren syndrome, but were present when the pseudolymphoma was 
solely apparent."
539757,"Blepharospasm is a cranial nerve dysfunction in which involuntary and 
uncontrollable forcible lid closure occurs. Surgical treatment is far from 
ideal, but the condition can be improved by sectioning the branches of the 
facial nerve plexus which supply the orbicularis oculi, the frontalis and 
corrugator muscles, and the midfacial muscles. Not all patients with 
blepharospasm should be operated upon, since they may expect too much or may 
enjoy the attention their invalidism has given them. Ectropion of one or both 
lower lids may occur, and the most severe of all complications is recurrence. 
This may happen despite a careful microscopic search for the nerve fibers and 
their division and avulsion. Blepharospasm patients often require considerable 
psychological support."
541897,"Heat production of isolated brown-fat cells by addition of noradrenaline and 
glucagon was measured in warm-acclimated control, cold-acclimated and 
heat-acclimated rats by use of a twin-type conduction microcalorimeter. 
Noradrenaline and glucagon induced maximum heat production per 10(6) cells in 
dose of 1 microgram/ml. Heat produced by maximum thermogenic response to 
glucagon was twice as much as that to noradrenaline. Thermogenic response to 
noradrenaline was markedly increased in cold-acclimated brown adipocytes, while 
it was reduced in heat-acclimated ones. Thermogenic response to glucagon was 
significantly reduced in heat-acclimated brown adipocytes, while it was not 
affected in cold-acclimated brown adipocytes."
557175,"Forty-five patients with aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery distal to the 
anterior communicating artery were operated on by a direct approach method in 
the years 1960-1973. The incidence of aneurysms in this location was 4.8% of the 
total 1,000 aneurysms. It is of upmost importance in the treatment of aneurysms 
to insure the parent artery for the purpose of temporary occlusion. This makes 
it easier and safer to approach the aneurysmal neck and to handle possible 
premature aneurysmal rupture. From this technical standpoint, the aneurysms in 
this location were classified into two types, ascending and horizontal. 
Aneurysms of the pericallosal artery between the origin of the anterior 
communicating artery and the knee of the corpus callosum were designated as the 
aneurysms of the ascending portion, whereas the aneurysms of the pericallosal 
artery from the knee of the corpus callosum and beyond were designated as the 
aneurysms of the horizontal portion. Depending on the location of the aneurysm, 
craniotomy was performed at one of two different sites. For aneurysms of the 
ascending portion, bifrontal craniotomy was determined and applied as the safest 
approach. A small parasagittal craniotomy was determined to be sufficient for 
aneurysms of the horizontal portion. Although the total operative mortality was 
4 of 45 cases (9.0%), no mortalities nor morbidities occurred in the last 12 
cases since 1972, when the sites of craniotomies were differenciated."
578375,"Triiodothyronine (T3) toxicity has been well documented in adults, but only 
isolated cases have been reported in children. Two girls presented with firm 
goitres and overt hyperthyroidism. In each patient, total serum thyroxine (T4) 
values by competitive protein binding were normal, however total T3 values by 
radioimmunoassay were elevated. One patient had Graves' disease, the second 
patient had Hashimoto's disease which has been only infrequently associated with 
T3 toxicity in adults. Both patients responded to therapy with propylthiouracil. 
The mechanisms by which T3 is preferentially secreted in thyrotoxic states in 
man are poorly understood, but iodine deficiency and poor iodination of 
thyroglobulin may be important factors."
589307,"The usefulness of blood enzyme determinations as markers of liver necrosis was 
tested in 100 alcoholics who underwent biopsy during clinical investigation. 
Mean values of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), serum aspartate and alanine 
transferase (SGOT and SGPT), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT), and 
gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP) tended to rise with increasing liver 
cell necrosis, though values of SGOT, SGPT, OCT, and gamma-GTP showed 
considerable overlap between the 32 patients with histologically proved 
hepatitis and the 68 without. By contrast, GDH values showed virtually no 
overlap between patients with and without hepatitis, and a value of two and a 
half times the normal value discriminated between the two groups. Because of its 
easy determination and its reliable reflection of liver cell necrosis the GDH 
concentration should be estimated routinely in alcoholic patients."
595894,"Previous experiments to separate the amylase and ""invertase"" of honey by 
chromatography on sephadex-gels were unsuccesful. It was shown that 
honey-amylase, -like amylases form other sources -- has hydrophobic properties. 
Therefore it was possible to separate amylase-activity from other activities by 
means of hydrophobic affinity chromatography on phenyl-butylamine-Sepharose 4B."
596247,"Serum lipids and thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km 
cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days. 
Serum cholesterol was unchanged immediately after the race, but then fell 
significantly and remained low during the observation period. During the race 
the fatty acid composition of serum free fatty acids changed towards the 
composition of ordinary adipose tissue. The compostiion of serum triglycerides 
showed similar but less pronouced changes. On the following days an increase in 
the arachidonic, and a decrease in the linoleic acid fraction of the total serum 
lipids were observed. Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were 
significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the 
pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. The observations 
correspond to the findings during acute, severe illness, and are compatible with 
the hypothesis that some of the changes in serum lipids following severe somatic 
stress are due to increased thyroid hormone activity."
656568,"Thermoplasma acidophilum, a thermophilic mycoplasma, has several unusual 
features suggesting a possible relationship to eukaryotic cells. One feature is 
a histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into 
subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin. A second feature is an 
association of cytoplasmic proteins that resembles eukaryotic actin and myosin. 
These two components are widely distributed in different groups of eukaryotic 
cells, but are typically lacking in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, T. 
acidophilum lacks cytochromes and respires by enzymes that apparently are not 
coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. This primitive type of respiration 
resembles that of microbodies, another feature which is represented in the 
cytoplasm of all groups of eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, since T. acidophilum 
lacks a cell wall and appears to have a primitive correlate of endocytosis, it 
would appear to be mechanically capable of acquiring a symbiotic mitochondrion. 
Thus, our observations are consistent with the symbiotic hypothesis for the 
origin of eukaryotic cells. We suggest that an organism similar to T. 
acidophilum was the host cell for the original symbiosis, becoming the nucleus 
and cytoplasm of modern eukaryotic cells."
659256,"Estimates of the newborn frequency of cystic fibrosis in different Caucasian 
groups range from 4 times more to 40 times less common than the generally 
accepted figure of 1:2000. Current meconium screening trials which may be 
effective in populations with the incidence equal to or greater than 1:2000, may 
be useful for populations with an incidence as low as 1:7000 only after maximum 
improvement of the methods. Once the true incidence or the variable incidence is 
proven for Caucasian populations, screening trails in Negro, Oriental and Indian 
populations will be required."
667214,"There are many procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms in plant kingdom. It is 
hoped that the study of plant histones will be useful in evolutionary studies. 
The histones of great variety of animal species have been studied and well 
characterized. Less information is available concerning plant histones. The 
general conclusion drawn from these investigations is that most organisms of 
eucaryotic plant and animal species contain the same five major histone 
fractions. Recently the histone-like proteins were found in some primitive 
eucaryotes and procaryotes. Data on histones from higher and lower eucaryotes 
and histone-like proteins of procaryotes are reviewed. Evolution of histones and 
their appearance prior to that of eucaryotic cell is postulated. The role of 
histones in evolution of nucleosomes is discussed."
680606,"Twenty-one patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been on a gluten free 
diet regularly followed up for at least one year (mean four years). Eighteen 
patients had a 'flat' mucosal appearance (grade III), one patient had moderately 
severe mucosal abnormality (grade II), one patient had mild mucosal abnormality 
(grade I), and one patient had a normal mucosal appearance (grade O). On the 
diet, 10 patients had no skin rash and took no dapsone, seven patients 
controlled the skin rash on a lower dose of dapsone, and four noticed no 
improvement. There was no correlation between pre-diet jejunal morphology and 
response of the skin. A repeat jejunal biopsy, on the gluten free diet, was 
possible in 15 patients. While all those with skin improvement showed some 
improvement in jejunal morphology, there was no association between the degree 
of skin improvement and the degree of recovery of the jejunal mucosa."
697225,"Seven women in three generations of a family have been affected by Turner 
syndrome. Turner phenotype in this family is the result of deletion of the 
entire short arm of one X chromosome. The short arm deletion is transmitted by 
carriers of a balanced X-1 translocation. Autoradiographic findings showed that 
the deleted X chromosome was late labeling in those persons with Turner 
syndrome, whereas the normal X chromosome was late replicating in carriers of 
the balanced translocation. The results of Xga typing of erythrocytes suggest 
that the Xg locus is on the short arm of the X chromosome. Because of the 
clinical implications, we believe that families of persons with structural 
chromosomal abnormalities should be studied to exclude familial transmission."
698128,"Four amphipathic drugs, primaquine, propranolol, chlorpromazine and tetracaine, 
were used to cause endocytosis in glucose-depleted red cells, and the relative 
reduction of membrane surfaces was measured by the toluidine blue (TB) method. 
The TB measurements correlated well with the observed electron microscopic 
alterations. In vitro blood storage studies indicated loss of cell membrane 
during storage correlated with decreasing uptake of TB by the red cells. 
Regeneration of cellular ATP with adenosine did not always restore TB uptake by 
the cells. Loss of red blood cell membrane either by exocytosis or endocytosis 
may occur during normal in vivo or in vitro ageing, and may be increased in 
pathological states or by the action of drugs."
708596,"PUVA therapy successfully cleared various dermatoses mainly confined to the 
palms and soles in 18 of 20 patients treated. The conditions treated were: 
plaque-type psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, endogenous eczema and persistent 
palmoplantar pustulosis. Seventeen patients were treated in a controlled study 
of PUVA therapy versus no treatment at all and in 16 of these patients the 
disease was cleared in the PUVA-treated areas while the untreated areas remained 
unchanged or deteriorated. Twelve of the 18 patients were maintained in a clear 
state by continued maintenance PUVA treatment over 6--31 months while 3 patients 
had a spontaneous remission and are free of disease off all treatment."
717321,"Forty-six cases of basilar skull fractures in children were reviewed to 
determine the incidence of CNS infection following injury and the possible value 
of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. The clinical course of the children who were 
treated with antibiotics was compared with that of patients who received no 
antimicrobial therapy. Included in the study were patients with hemotympanum 
alone or with hemotympanum plus additional clinical or roentgenographic signs of 
basilar skull fracture; patients with tympanic membrane perforation without 
otorrhea but with blood in the auditory canal; and children with either otorrhea 
or rhinorrhea. Acute, delayed, or recurrent infection of the CNS did not develop 
in any of the patients. This study is the first of its kind presented in 
children. It would seem on the basis of the present series that the systematic 
use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with hemotympanum following basilar 
skull fractures is unwarranted and that children with other signs of basilar 
skull fractures may have an equally small risk of meningitis following injury."
729003,"During the late stage of adenovirus 2 infection, RNA chains are initiated at a 
site near coordinate 16 (Evans et al., 1977) and transcribed approximately 
30,000 nucleotides to the far end of the genome at coordinate 100. Late mRNAs 
processed from these transcripts contain a common spliced tripartite leader 
(Berget, Moore and Sharp, 1977; Chow et al., 1977a) encoded at approximately 16, 
20 and 27, and protein coding sequences which map downstream. This report maps 
the late promoter and the capped 5' end of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from 
this transciption unit, and analyzes their structures. We show that nascent RNA 
chains pulse-labeled in vivo are initiated at coordinate 16.5 +/- 0.5 and 
contain the sequences intervening between the leader segments. We map the capped 
5' terminus of late nuclear transcripts at a site between 16.4 and 16.6 by 
aligning T1 RNAase oligonucleotides from nuclear RNA with the DNA sequence of 
the promoter region. The structure of the first eleven residues of the capped 5' 
terminus of late mRNA was determined by direct RNA sequencing. This structure 
corresponds exactly to a DNA sequence at coordinate 16.4 and precisely positions 
the mRNA cap template within the promoter region. These results suggest that the 
promoter and the cap template sites are coincident, and that the initiating 
residues of the primary transcript are precursors of the capped 5' end of mRNA. 
Residues removed from transcripts by splicing were identified. These plus caps 
were detected in large polyadenylated nuclear RNA, indicating that capping and 
polyadenylation can occur on unspliced molecules. Residues retained in the mRNA 
first leader contain a nine residue sequence adjacent to the cap which is 
complementary to the 3' end of 18S rRNA, suggesting that the first leader 
functions in ribosome binding. Nucleotide sequences from the promoter region are 
compared with cellular counterparts. Strong homologies at cap sites and splice 
points suggest that for the noted cases, the virus and cell share closely 
related mechanisms for mRNA 5' end synthesis and splicing."
729595,"1. Decapped tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA and rabbit globin mRNA were prepared 
by enzymic treatment of RNAs with nucleotide pyrophosphatase purified from 
potato. The extent of removal of 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate 
(m7GMP) from TMV RNA was at least 97% as estimated by labeling of the 5' termini 
in vitro with S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine catalysed by vaccinia virus 
methyltransferases. 2. The effect of enzymic decapping was compared with the 
effect of cap analogs on mRNAs translation in a nuclease-treated rabbit 
reticulocyte lysate and in a wheat germ extract. When translation was studied at 
low K+ concentration, little or no dependence on 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine 
was found with either cell-free system. The importance of the 5'-terminal cap 
for the efficient translation of TMV RNA and globin mRNA increased as the 
concentration of K+ in a protein-synthesis system was raised. In a reticulocyte 
lysate analogs and enzymic decapping had a similar effect on translation. In a 
wheat germ extract, mRNA decapping resulted in a more pronounced decrease of 
mRNA activity, presumably due to the increased susceptibility of decapped mRNAs 
to the nucleases present in this protein synthesis system. 3. The requirement 
for a 5'-terminal cap was similar for the synthesis of 130,000-Mr and 165,000-Mr 
polypeptides coded by TMV RNA. This indicates that both proteins may be 
initiated at the common site close to the 5' terminus."

732079,"The activity of the pituitary hormones (ACTH, STH, TTH, FSH, LH), the adrenal 
hormones (cortisol, aldosterone), the kidney hormone (renin), and the thyroid 
hormones (thyroxine tri-iodthyronine), the thyroxine binding capacity of blood 
proteins and the activity of the hormones of the pancreas (insulin) and the sex 
glands (testosterone, estradiol) were studied in 26 males suffering from 
ischemic heart disease verified by means of selective coronarography and in 20 
healthy males with no atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart. 
Patients with ischemic heart disease were found to be marked by increased 
activity in the blood of ACTH, TTH, cortisol, aldosterone, insulin, and 
estradiol and reduced concentration of STH, thyroxine, and testosterone. These 
shifts in the activity of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system and in its 
subordinate hormonal systems play an important role in the origin of the 
atherosclerotic process and assosiated ischemic heart disease."
737550,"Twenty-four hours after a tetracycline injection, the unimpeded, and more 
rapidly erupting, mouse mandibular incisor contained 20% to 44% more 
tetracycline than the contralateral, uncut incisor. It was concluded that the 
increased tetracycline incorporation reflected a higher rate of mineralization 
associated with faster tooth formation in the unimpeded tooth. By measuring the 
amount of tetracycline which became incorporated at different times after an 
incisor was shortened, it was possible to investigate an early stage of the 
response of the incisor to cutting. A significant increase in the capacity of 
the tooth to incorporate tetracycline was detectable 4 h after shortening the 
tooth, and this was maximal after another 4 h."
806773,"Virological and serological methods were used in examination of 28 patients 
suffering from subacute thyroiditis de Quervain. Attempts to isolate a presumed 
viral agent from 8 patients were performed by inoculation of serum, urine, and 
aspiration biopsies of thyroid glands taken at different stages of the illness, 
into tissue cultures of different types of human and animal cells. Recovery of a 
cytopathic viral agent on cells of a rabbit lung continuous line was successful 
in 5 cases. Serological cross reactions exist between the isolated viruses and 
patient serum but not with serum of healthy people. Cases with the acquired 
illness and positive antibodies against the isolated viruses who had been in 
close and prolonged contact with patients suffering from subacute thyroiditis de 
Quervain were also investigated."
807555,"When observed in the electron microscope intact gas vesicles appeared as 
transparent areas in whole cells of Microcylus aquaticus, whereas vesicles 
collapsed by centrifugation were not discernible. Within 5 min of suspending 
cells containing collapsed vesicles in growth medium, small transparent vesicles 
were detected. By 15 min the average number of vesicles per cell was 15. This 
number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased 
until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, 
interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the 
synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at 
which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which 
resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This 
evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical 
portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages 
subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and 
presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle 
assembly. In addition, inhibition of protein or ribonucleic acid synthesis 
resulted in a loss of extant gas vesicles. Over the time course of our study, 
deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was not required for gas vesicle assembly or 
stability."
812306,"It was shown in the passive hemagglutination test (PHAT) with a type-specific 
somatic antigen on 147 carriers of toxigenic diphtheria bacilli that the PHAT 
titres of 1/80 and over were determined in 64% of bacteria. In the process of 
carrier state of toxigenic bacteria antimicrobial antibodies were detected in 
79% of the children; after the release from the carrier state, the percentage 
was from 57 to 26, depending on the time lapse after it. Among the carriers of 
nontoxigenic diphtheria bacilli the PHAT titre of 1/80 and over was established 
in up to 20% of children, and only in those which were in the focus of toxigenic 
bacilli carriers. The applied test could be used for epidemiological purpose to 
determine the spread of the carrier state of toxigenic bacteria in a collective 
body."
838566,"In a survey in Israel of 50 patients with Wilson's disease, it was found that 
this disease occurred in all ethnic groups. In the Arab patients there was a 
significantly early age of onset and the disease followed a more severe course 
than that in the Jewish patients. The overall sex ratio of patients was nearly 
1:1, and genetic analysis of 20 families confirmed an autosomal recessive mode 
of inheritance. The very similar age of onset and type of disease within 
sibships and the varying ages of onset noted between the Arab and Jewish 
patients suggest that the disease is genetically heterogeneous."
839237,"Rats with parasagittal incised wounds of the telencephalon were treated for 1,7, 
21 or 56 days with triiodothyronine (T3), 0.5 mug/100 g body weight, injected 
once daily. Controls were injected with the aqueous solution in which the T3 was 
dissolved. The brains were examined histologically and quantitative assessments 
were made of the regeneration of axons into and across the lesions and of the 
healing of the wounds. T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated 
axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted 
healing of the wound in the corpus callosum. The results of this investigation 
suggest that the use of T3 in the clinical treatment of injury to the central 
nervous system may be of less value than the work of earlier authors had 
indicated."
841409,"Regurgitation of food by rumination has rarely been reported in latency-age 
children. A 7-year-old boy had symptoms of rumination, gagging, bruxism, and 
enuresis. During the oppositional stage of development many unresolved conflicts 
had developed between the patient and his parents. Short-term psychotherapy 
which focused on resolution of the power struggles produced rapid remission of 
the symptoms. A two-year follow-up showed no recurrence of difficulty."
842709,"The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic 
drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an 
average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss

uncertain, but a central anorexigenic effect may be an important factor."
848258,"In the rabbit intestine Peyer's patches can easily be distinguished. They are 
found in the jejunum and ileum, but not in the duodenum. The highest number 
observed is seven. In most animals the first, i.e. proximally situated patch has 
a rather well-defined place in the beginning of the jejunum; similarly, the 
last, i.e. distally situated one mostly has its place in the end of the ileum. 
The demarcation of the three classical sections of the small intestine is 
discussed from a comparative viewpoint with special criticism as to what is 
called ileum in man."
871409,"Zieve's syndrome (ZS), which consists of transient haemolytic anaemia, jaundice, 
hyperlipoproteinaemia, and alcohol-induced liver disease, was studied in male 
patients during the acute (n = 20) and the remittent (n = 10) phase. Chronic 
alcoholics (n = 10) without haemolysis and healthy male persons (n = 10) served 
as controls. Erythrocytes were separated into old and young cells by means of 
density-layer centrifugation. Those fractions which contained older red cells 
disclosed a pyruvate-kinase instability which resulted in impaired metabolism. 
Changes in membrane lipid composition as indicated by increased cholesterol and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also detected in patients during the 
acute phase of ZS. Alcohol-induced red-cell vitamin-E deficiency with a decrease 
in PUFA levels may provoke an oxidation of reduced red-cell glutathione which in 
turn results in the enzyme instability. This study lends further support to the 
hypothesis that the putative role of the red-cell metabolic injury in the origin 
of haemolysis in ZS cannot be envisaged without introducing membrane-linked and 
extracellular cofactors."

937227,"In the first part of this study, the effect of four isocaloric mixed breakfast 
meals on the blood glucose and urinary glucose losses was tested in nine adult 
diabetics and in three healthy subjects, ages 60 to 75. Three of the test meals 
consisted of a base diet supplemented with applesauce sweetened with sucrose, 
fructose, or sorbitol. In the fourth test meal, the starch was increased 
together with saccharine. In the second part of the study, analyses for free 
glucose and sucrose in several timed food preparations, ordinary as well as food 
preparations specially designed for diabetics, were performed. The amount of 
sucrose equivalents (S(eg)) in one ordinary serving of the various products was 
estimated. No significant differences among sucrose, fructose, and 
sorbitol-containing meals with respect to the effect on the blood glucose level 
or on glucosuria were found. The saccharine-containing meal gave a significantly 
greater blood glucose increase at 60 min only. The amount of sucrose in ordinary 
marinated foods, such as herring, cucumber, and common beet was negligible. 
Water-packed fruits supplied one half of the amount of S(eq) or less, compared 
with fruits packed in sorbitol-sweetened syrup. The amount of S(eq) in the 
latter products as well as in fruits packed in unsweetened juice equalled that 
of the fleshy substance of ordinary sucrose-sweetened products. It was concluded 
that fructose or sorbitol has no advantages over sucrose, as regards the effect 
on blood glucose in well-regulated adult diabetics, and that it seems 
unnecessary to have specially sweetened foods designed for diabetics."
939547,"The formal genetics of Fanconi's anemia were investigated on the basis of 21 
families from different European countries, and of 69 families from the 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. The result of segregation analysis is compatible with the 
hypothesis of a simple autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. 2. The number of 
sporadic cases is not greater than expected. 3. Among the affected siblings in 
the sibships analyzed, males are somewhat more frequent than females. However, 
this sex difference is also found among the unaffected siblings, and it is not 
statistically significant. 4. Contrary to assertions made in the literature, 
there is no clustering of affected in the sequence of siblings, no maternal age 
effect, and no preference of higher birth orders. 5. A high intrafamilial 
correlation for age at onset, and (very probably) number and severity of 
malformations points to genetic heterogeneity. Apart from the standard type, an 
especially mild type with late onset, few malformations, and a relatively benign 
course seems to exist. Its counterpart is possibly an especially severe type 
with early onset, many malformations, and a malignant course. However, definite 
conclusions on the special character of this heterogeneity will require 
application of additional methods."
956186,"The 5' termini of many viral and cellular mRNAs contain sequences of the type 
m7G(5"")pppNm. An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates 
the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside 
triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. 
Approximately two-thirds of the methyltransferase activity detected in an assay 
employing umnethylated vaccinia virus mRNA as acceptor was located in the 
cytoplasm when cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization; 30% of the 
cytoplasmic activity was associated with ribosomes but was removed by washing 
with 0.5 M KCl. The enzyme was purified 165-fold from the cytoplasm by removing 
nucleic acid by phase partition followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and 
column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, denatured DNA-agarose, and CM-Sephadex. 
The partially purified enzyme preparation methylated heterologous tRNAs as well 
as vaccinia mRNA, but the tRNA methyltransferases could be separated from the 
mRNA activity by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration on Sephadex 
G-200. The product of the partially purified enzyme using vaccinia mRNA as 
substrate was exclusively 7-methylguanosine located in the terminal dinucleoside 
triphosphate. In addition to RNAs and synthetic polyribonucleotides terminating 
in a dinucleoside triphosphate, free G(5')pppG could be methylated but GTP, GDP, 
and G(5')pppG could not. The enzyme also methylated the dinucleoside diphosphate 
G(5')pppG but much less efficiently than G(5')pppG. An S20, W of 3.8, a Stokes 
radius of 3.6 nm, and a molecular weight of 56,000 were obtained from sucrose 
gradient sedimentation and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography."
958900,"In 22 patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency the serum concentrations of 
trijodothyronin, thyroxine and thyrotropin and also the T4-binding capacity of 
TBG were determined. The mean serum T3 concentration was found to be 
significantly lower in patients with hepatic coma when compared with euthyroid 
subjects. In the cases of renal insufficiency the serum T3 concentrations were 
in the normal range. Due to hormone loss through dialysis however, the mean 
value of the T3 concentrations was slightly lower than the average concentration 
of normal subjects. The obtained results agree with those of our earlier studies 
which showed that there are significant differences between liver artery and 
vein T3 concentrations in serum, whereas no such differences could be 
ascertained between serum concentrations in renal artery and vein. On the basis 
of these findings it is assumed that conversion of T4 into T3 occurs 
predominantly in the liver."
962510,"In 134 out of 180 perirenal fat samples (74%) derived from Japanese necropsy 
cases aged from 1 month to 86 years, the brown fat tissue persisted in variable 
amounts. Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are 
fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be 
produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. Type 2 cells are 
small-locular cells suitable for rapid oxidation of fat droplets. Type 3 
(middle-locular) and 4 (large-locular) represent fat-storage cells containing 
large amounts of fat. Type 5 cells are thought to be transitional forms between 
multilocular brown fat cells and monolocular white fat cells. Type 6 
(cytoplasm-rich multilocular) cells, usually found together with Type 1 cells, 
are thought to be fat-depleting or -consuming cells, since in them fat droplets 
are reduced in number and size probably in consequence of oxidation of fat, but 
by contrast granular cytoplasm is increased in amount separating the individual 
fat droplets by thick cytoplasmic septa. The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 
cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests 
that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue 
and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. In the present study, 
the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to 
the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. In the majority of perirenal fat 
samples from infants (1-11 months) relatively numerous Types 1 and 6 cells were 
frequently revealed together with Type 2 cells, suggesting rapid and active heat 
production in support of the view that in human infants the brown fat tissue may 
be thermogenetically active to maintain body temperature. In the same manner, 
marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in brown 
fat tissue of children and teenagers. In younger and elderly adults the 
frequency of occurrence and the amount of the perirenal brown fat tissue were 
decreased but Types 1 and/or 6 cells could be found in 17-40% of them, 
infrequently together, with Type 2 cells, suggesting persistence of the 
thermogenic activity with occasional large heat production especially in younger 
adults (20-39 years). Thus, the results obtained in this study have clarified 
that the human brown fat tissue can respond to stimuli given to the body by 
oxidation of stored fat even in the latest decades of life. In cases of death 
from burning, drowning, bleeding, drug poisoning etc., numerous Types 1 and/or 6 
cells were found, suggesting that an active fat oxidation would take place in 
brown fat tissue assumedly as the result of the raised noradrenalin level in 
this tissue. The so-called small cytoplasmic cells found in perirenal fats from 
cases of death from liver cirrhosis and other causes were assumed to be atrophic 
fat-depleted brown fat cells."

monounsaturated fatty acids C 16-C 18 smaller contents of longchain highly 
unsaturated fatty acids. The changes in the fatty acid pattern mainly occurred 
in patients with Zieve Syndrome and could be important for the mechanism of the 
hemolytic anemia. Theses findings could be in connexion with vitamin E 
deficiency."
991106,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14 
patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation 
therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at 
diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the 
rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years 
following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in 
patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five 
other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy 
achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+ 
months, respectively. Following disappearance of tumor in the latter two, 
pulmonary irradiation was administered in an attempt to consolidate the 
response, but tumor recurred 6 months later. These patients eventually died of 
widespread disease although survival appeared prolonged in comparison to that 
seen in past experience. Chemotherapy was well tolerated, although three 
patients developed hemorrhagic cystitis, necessitating discontinuation of 
cyclophosphamide. The data suggest the potential for prolonged control and an 
increase in the cure rate with this therapeutic approach."
995018,"A case is reported in which features of pseudohypoparathyroidism were found in

been clearly established in the cri du chat syndrome."
999108,"Thirty-eight patients with chronic renal insufficiency who were in a dialysis 
program underwent studies of thyroid function and metabolic status. Mean values 
for serum total and free thyroxine (T4) concentrations and thyroxine-binding 
globulin capacity were within normal limits. Although mean serum total 
triiodothyronine (T3) concentration was normal, 43% of the group had low serum 
T3 and 54% had low serum free T3 concentrations. Serum thyrotrophin (TSH) 
concentrations were normal in all but four subjects who had very slight 
elevations. Metabolic status was assessed by various metabolic tests; mean 
values for each of these tests were normal, and the clinical index scores 
indicated that all patients were euthyroid. Results of metabolic testing were 
similar in patients with low and those with normal serum T3 concentrations. Low 
serum T3 measurements did not accurately reflect metabolic state in patients 
with chronic renal failure, whereas serum free T4 and TSH concentrations were 
reliable indicators of thyroid state."
1002690,"Characterization of the donor and acceptor specificities of mRNA 
guanylyltransferase and mRNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase isolated from 
vaccinia virus cores has enabled us to discriminate between alternative reaction 
sequences leading to the formation of the 5'-terminal m7G(5')pppN-structure. The 
mRNA guanylyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a residue of GMP from GTP to 
acceptors which possess a 5'-terminal diphosphate. A diphosphate-terminated 
polyribonucleotide is preferred to a mononucleoside diphosphate as an acceptor 
suggesting that the guanylyltransferase reaction occurs after initiation of RNA 
synthesis. Although all of the homopolyribonucleotides tested (pp(A)n, pp(G)n, 
pp(I)n, pp(U)n, and pp(C)n) are acceptors for the mRNA guanylyltransferase 
indicating lack of strict sequence specificity, those containing purines are 
preferred. Only GTP and dGTP are donors in the reaction; 7-methylguanosine (m7G) 
triphosphate specifically is not a donor indicating that guanylylation must 
precede guanine-7-methylation. The preferred acceptor of the mRNA 
(guanine-7-)-methyltransferase is the product of the guanylyltransferase 
reaction, a polyribonucleotide with the 5'-terminal sequence G(5')pppN-. The 
enzyme can also catalyze, but less efficiently methylation of the following: 
dinucleoside triphosphates with the structure G(5')pppN, GTP, dGTP, ITP, GDP, 
GMP, and guanosine. The enzyme will not catalyze the transfer of methyl groups 
to ATP, XTP, CTP, UTP, or to guanosine-containing compounds with phosphate 
groups in either positions 2' or 3' or in 3'-5' phosphodiester linkages. The 
latter specificity provides an explanation for the absence of internal 
7-methylguanosine in mRNA. In the presence of PPi, the mRNA guanylyltransferase 
catalyzes the pyrophosphorolysis of the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppA, but 
not of m7G(5')pppA. Since PPi is generated in the process of RNA chain 
elongation, stabilization of the 5'-terminal sequences of mRNA is afforded by 
guanine-7-methylation."
1006494,"A quarter of a century ago Professor C. F. M. Saint of the University of Cape 
Town noted the occasional association of diverticular disease, hiatus hernia,

the diseases are casually related to the consumption of fibre-depleted diets."
1067597,"The three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b, a neurotoxin in the venom of 
the sea snake Laticauda semifasciata, has been determined from a 2.75 A 
resolution electron density map. Erabutoxin b is one of a family of snake venom 
neurotoxins, all low-molecular-weight proteins, which block neuromuscular 
transmission at the postsynaptic membrane. They specifically inhibit the 
acetylcholine receptor. The molecular shape is that of a shallow elongated 
saucer with a footed stand formed by the six-membered ring at the COOH-terminal 
end. The central core of the molecule is an assembly of four disulfide bridges. 
Three long chain loops emerge as broad fronds from the core region. 
Approximately 40% of the main chain is organized into a twisted antiparallel 
beta-pleated sheet of five short strands. In 28 snake venom neurotoxins of 
established sequence which inhibit the acetylcholine receptor, the four 
disulfide bridges and seven other residues remain invariant. Three substitution 
positions conserve residue type. In one wing of the molecule, there is a broad 
shallow depression which may characterize the reactive site. It is populated by 
the sevent invariant residues and two of the three type conserved residues. This 
region is ""anchored"" on the undersurface of the molecule by the hydroxyl group 
of Ser-9, the remaining conservatively substituted residue."

the electrode are the following factors: the battery hat sufficient freedom of 
movement for rotation following exudation into the pacemaker cavity, the 
electrode was elastic and above all the pacemaker system was infected which 
could no longer guarantee a sufficient fixation of the electrode in the infected

unfractionated and CR- B cell populations are capable of producing antibody to 
red cell antigens, they differ in their requirements for the initiation of the 
response. Unfractionated B cells cooperate with primed as well as unprimed 
helper T cells; macrophages are required for this cooperation but can be 
replaced by 2-mercaptoethanol. CR- B cells cooperate with primed but not with 
unprimed T cells provided macrophages are added to cultures. After addition of

1084238,"Three patients with Fanconi's anemia were analyzed for chromosome breaks. T and 
B cells were separated and grown in tissue culture with PHA and pokeweed antigen 
to ascertain the rates of breakage in these lymphocytic subpopulations. It has 
been found that there is no statistically significant difference in breakage 
rates in T and B lymphocytes. It is postulated that both T and B cells could be

that chromosome breaks constitute a factor predisposing to the development of 
malignancy."
1122928,"Reversible haemolytic anaemia associated with decreased red cell half-life and 
reticulocytosis was studied in 10 patients with Zieve's syndrome. Since the 
underlying cause of the red cell destruction is as yet unknown, we determined 
the critical metabolic functions of the red cells in order to define the assumed 
intracorpuscular defect causing haemolysis. The glucose metabolizing enzymes had 
normal or raised values. - In view of the diminished ATP and raised 
2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2.3 DPG) levels - a combination which suggests a 
pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency - additional procedures were carried out in 
order to detect an abnormal activity of the red cell PK. Studies of biochemical 
properties of PK such as thermostability, Michaelis-Menten constants, and 
activation and inhibition tests brought results markedly deviating from the 
norm.-Fractions containing old cells particularly disclosed PK instability. A 
defective red cell matabolism resulted which was measurable through 
ATP-instability, altered glucose utilization and lactate production. - 
Experimental cell aging procedures led to a markedly decreased red cell 
metabolism. These assays revealed that mutations of PK-control mechanisms might 
be involved as factor triggering haemolytic anaemia of Zieve's syndrome."

cultured skin fibroblasts derived from two subjects with that syndrome. At early 
passage the progeric fibroblasts, as compared to controls, contained a 
significantly higher percentage of heat-labile glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(12.83 plus or minus 1.72 vs 1.11 plus or minus 0.44 [mean plus or minus 
S.E.M.], p smaller than 0.001), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (9.71 plus or 
minus 0.68 vs. 0.67 plus or minus 0.22, p smaller than 0.001), and 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (31.41 plus or minus 1.89 vs 7.67 
plus or minus 1.71, p smaller than 0.001), and the differences were maintained 
throughout the in vitro life-span. These data, in conjunction with previous 
reports of defective HL-A antigens, indicate a widespread defect in genetic 
expression. The most likely cause appears to be an aberration in protein 
synthesis or degradation, or both, although multiple somatic mutations cannot be 
ruled out. Increased thermolability of enzymes in cultured cells may provide a 
screening test for persons predisposed to progeria and other disorders of 
premature aging."
1135705,"Malignant melanoma of the skin in Blacks in formidable and sinister tumour. This 
study is concerned with the epidemiology of malignant melanoma, as seen in both 
urban and rural Black Africans. A smaller series in which follow-up on the 
patients was available is included. To our knowledge, this is the first study of 
its kind in which follow-up, and hence survival figures, can be quoted. Although 
the numbers are relatively small, they provide a valuable indication of the 
behaviour of melanomas in this group. The difficulties of follow-up cannot be 
overemphasised, and follow-up on 79 cases out of 100 could be obtained only by 
the employment of an able and enthusiastic Black social worker for 3 years. The 
first recorded survival figures in a Black population show a 3-year survival 
rate of only 28,4%. Prognosis is related to the size and extent of the tumour 
with larger and more widespread tumours faring worse than others. The incidence 
of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted 
for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year 
age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the 
sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar 
and palmar surfaces."
1138394,"Follow-up data (over a 3-year period) and the histological appearances of 
primary lesion were studied and related in 40 Black patients with malignant 
melanoma. This to our knowledge is the first study in Black African patients. It 
was found that they present with large deeply invasive lesions, particularly on 
the foot. The prognosis is poor, with an over-all 3-year survival rate of 35%. 
The histological features used to assess the prognosis of malignant melanoma in 
Whites, that is histogenetic pattern, size and shape of the lesion, level of 
invasion, presence of ulceration and mitotic activity would seem to be equally 
applicable in Black patients. In addition, marked cellular pleomorphism, 
haemorrhage, necrosis and fibrosis within the tumour are bad signs. In this 
series lymphocytic infiltration, either within the tumour or at the edge, 
possibly indicative of an immune response, seemed to be of favourable prognostic 
import. Surprisingly, a lesion histologica-ly that of lentigo maligna melanoma 
was found on the feer of some blacks and could be related to much more 
favourable survival figures."
1180050,"The author experienced a case of subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain) in a 
36-year-old female. Electron microscopic examination of the thyroid tissue of 
the patient revealed virus-like particles (VLP) in the degenerated follicular 
epithelium Judging from the size, the VLP corresponded to the influenza or mumps 
virus."
1188317,"Severe red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency has been 
found in an 'aboriginal' Finnish family. 2 male and 9 female carriers of the 
variant G-6-PD were studied. The genetic pattern is consistent with x-linked 
recessive inheritance and the defect is associated with drug (primaquine) 
induced haemolysis. This was demonstrated by enzyme deficient red cell 
(51Cr-labelled) survival studies on a normal volunteer recipient. In addition, 
one of the hemizygotes studied had a slight chronic nonspherocytic haemolytic 
disorder. The partially purified enzyme had many of the characteristics of 
G-6-PD Mediterranean. The occurrence of this G-6-PD Mediterranean type variant 
in the Finnish population, which differs greatly from Mediterranean ethnic 
groups, as well as the association of slight chronic haemolysis with severe 
G-6-PD deficiency is discussed."
1193013,"A protein that binds tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) with high specificity 
has been detected in normal rabbit serum. Scatchard plots revealed the protein 
to have a principal binding site with both high capacity and high affinity for 
tetrac (KA 4.8 X 10(10) M-1. Binding of tetrac by the protein is partially 
inhibited by barbital. During polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.0, the 
tetrac binding protein has a mobility characteristic of a prealbumin. As judged 
from competitive binding studies, the protein also binds tetraiodothyropropionic 
acid (tetraprop) firmly, but less so than tetrac. The apparent affinity of the 
protein for the triiodinated analogues of tetrac and tetraprop is only about 1% 
that for tetrac, and that for thyroxine (T4) only 0.6% that for tetrac; 
3,5,3'-triiodothyronine is not bound at all. The protein can be utilized in a 
competitive protein binding assay for tetrac in human serum, after removal of 
cross-reacting T4."
1213878,"Mitochondrial membranes reconstituted from lipid-depleted mitochondria and 
aqueous phospholipid dispersions still have the phospholipid negative charges 
available for ionic interaction with the basic protein, lysozyme. The 
stoichiometry of the binding is of about 6 nmoles of lysozyme per 100 nmoles of 
phospholipid in membranes reconstituted with Asolectin, and of 10 nmoles of 
phospholipid phosphorus in membranes reconstituted with cardiolipin. Unextracted 
submitochondrial particles ETP also bind lysozyme (about 3 nmoles per 100 nmoles 
of phospholipid). These observations indicate that the phospholipid anionic 
groups are not completely shielded by the mitochondrial proteins, which might 
occupy areas between the nonpolar groups of the lipid molecules."
1217221,"The macroscopic and microscopic findings of a case of Zieve's syndrome are 
described (fatty liver, icterus, hyperlipemia and hemolytic anemia in chronic 
alcoholism). The outstanding macroscopic finding is milky turbidity of the blood 
in arterial and venous vascular channels as well as hepatomegaly and anaemia of 
internal organs. A prominent feature of the histological picture is the 
high-grade lipaemia of the large and small vessels (arteries and veins), 
capillary occlusions resembling fat embolism in all organs and severe diffuse 
fatty metamorphosis of the liver. Circulatory disorders and the cause of death 
are discussed."
1224004,"The effect of molindone on the activity of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the rat 
midbrain and on DA metabolism in the striatum and olfactory tubercles was 
studied using extracellular single unit recording and biochemical techniques 
respectively. Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to 
reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to 
block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to 
increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum 
and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically 
to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs 
previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA 
cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this 
regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine. Possible 
mechanisms of action of molindone are discussed based on these findings."
1225290,"Wallaroos (Macropus robustus robustus), which have the G6PD-F electrophoretic 
phenotype, crossed with euros (M.r.erubescens), of G6PD-S phenotype, produced F1 
animals which had only the maternal G6PD type regardless of the direction of the 
cross. When F1 hybrids were backcrossed to wallaroos or euros, backcross progeny 
of either perental phenotype resulted. Sex-linked inheritance of allelic G6PD 
genes is shown to occur in wallaroos, euros and red kangaroos (M. rufus). Dose 
compensation for X chromosomes at the G6PD locus in kangaroow is achieved by 
inactivation of the allele of male parental origin."
1240972,"A 7-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for anaemia, secondary to 
intestinal blood los (melaena). She was found to have 45,X Turner's syndrome. 
Her identical twin sister also had Turner's syndrome with a 45,X chromosome 
complement. According to various criteria the probability of monozygosity was 
0.9905. Although the incidence of twinning is greater than usual in families of 
patients with Turner's syndrome, affected cases have only been observed in twin 
sisters on six occasions. It seems therefore that the 45,X chromosome complement 
itself is not a factor predisposing to twinning, but that in some families, a 
factor is at play, which cuases either twinning or the 45,X aneuploidy, or both."
1244548,"Despite current surgical therapy, about 80 per cent of patients with malignant 
melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes succumb to systemic metastatic disease. To 
determine if postoperative adjuvant immunization with BCG was an effective 
systemic treatment in these patients with microscopic subclinical metastatic 
disease, the clinical course of 42 patients treated by operation alone was 
compared with that of 84 treated by operation and BCG. At two years, the 
incidence of metastasis in BCG-treated patients was half that of the control 
group. BCG was more effective in patients with a smaller tumor burden at the 
time of initial surgical treatment. In patients receiving BCG adjuvant therapy, 
90 per cent with microscopic disease in one lymph node appeared free of disease 
as compared to 40 per cent with macroscopic disease in multiple nodes. In 
patients with recurrences, an immunotherapeutic effect was demonstrated by a 
delay of six months in the time to recurrence. Thus, BCG immunotherapy appears 
to have an inhibiting effect on the ""micrometastases"" of malignant melanoma."
1247555,"1. Mitochondria, inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and microsomes were 
isolated and purified from pig heart. Their lipid composition and protein 
components were studied. 2. The fatty acid distribution in the main 
phospholipids seemed specific rather of a given phospholipid and not of one type 
of membrane. 3. Inner mitochondrial membranes were characterized by a high 
content in cardiolipin and a very low level of triglycerides together with a 
high degree of unsaturation and C18 acids. Gel electrophoresis revealed 13 
different polypeptide subunits of which 5 were major ranging in molecular 
weights from 10000 to 215000. 4. In outer mitochondrial membranes, total lipid, 
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, plasmologen and triglyceride contents 
were much higher than in inner membranes. Fatty acids of phospholipids were 
mostly saturated and the polypeptide pattern showed 12 components, of which 4 
were major of mol. wt 75000, 60000, 20000 and below 10000. 5. Compared to outer 
membrane, microsomes exhibited a much higher cholesterol content and markedly 
different protein profiles. They contained significant amounts of cardiolipin 
and phosphatidylserine, this latter phospholipid being exclusively located in 
microsomes. However odd similarities were observed in some lipid components of 
microsomes and inner mitochondrial membranes, but fatty acids were more 
saturated in microsomes and electrophoretic profiles of protein components 
appeared very different and revealed components of high mol. wt."
1248830,"Dermatoglyphics of 11 patients with Wilson's disease and 16 of their clinically 
asymptomatic relatives of first degree were investigated; 11 of the latter ones 
were heterozygous in agreement with the turn over rates of Cu-67, 12 under the 
assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance. On the finger tips the Mb. Wilson 
patients showed 52.7% whorls, their heterozygous relatives about 40%; compared 
with our controls (males 33.16%, females 28.82%, Aue-Hauser, 1970) that means a 
strong increase of this pattern type. On the palm the high frequency of 
hypothenar patterns in homo- and heterozygotes for Wilson's disease and of loops 
with accessory triradius in the 4th interdigitum of the patients with Wilson's 
disease was striking."
1310964,"The ability to vary the proton energy (depth of beam penetration) and modulate 
the dose distribution at the end of range permits delivery of an increased dose 
to the designated cancer-containing volume with a reduced dose to overlying 
normal brain tissue. The evolution of childhood CNS malignancy following therapy 
is reviewed to identify radiation response variables indicating where the proton 
dose distribution will improve the therapeutic ratio. The review documents that 
of the 1262 children expected to develop CNS malignancy in 1989, only 43% will 
survive 5 years. About 75% of those with medulloblastoma and over 90% with 
astrocytoma die from persistent (in-field) disease. When the patient has been 
treated with radiation, it is accepted that disease persistence indicates the 
cancer dose was insufficient. Potentially 536 children could show an improved 
incidence of local control and improved survival from an increased cancer dose 
available from proton irradiation. As the total dose and volume of brain 
irradiated is increased about 1800 cGy, brain dysfunction increases, producing a 
spectrum of functional and intellectual deficits which are age and volume 
related. About 900 irradiated patients would have fewer in-field histologic and 
functional changes if the dose to normal brain, or the volume of brain 
irradiated, is reduced by an improved dose distribution. A proton beam treatment 
plan, delivering a cancer dose of 7400 cGy, is simulated for a thalamic 
astrocytoma. The dose distribution of this plan is compared with an x-ray plan 
used to treat a patient, in which a dose of 5400 cGy was delivered to the 
astrocytoma. Comparative isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms 
indicate a decreased integral dose to normal brain and a decreased volume of 
normal brain irradiated, even as the cancer dose is boosted 2000 cGy with 
protons."
1311751,"The neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent acute 
toxins known and are the causative agents of the neuroparalytic disease 
botulism. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by 
blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are 
seven distinct serotypes of toxin. All are polypeptides of Mr about 150 kDa that 
have similar structure and pharmacological action. In their most active forms 
the toxins exist as dichain molecules in which a heavy (H) chain is linked by 
disulphide bonding to a light (L) chain. The H chain is believed to be 
associated with the highly specific and avid binding of toxin to the motor nerve 
end plates and also with the process of internalisation of the toxin. The toxic 
activity appears to be associated with the L chain which blockades the 
calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering at the 
molecular level with the mechanisms whereby neurotransmitter-containing vesicles 
merge with the plasmalemma. The type A toxin is now used therapeutically to 
treat a variety of conditions involving involuntary muscle spasm. The 
therapeutic toxin is a neurotoxin-haemagglutinin complex isolated from cultures 
of C. botulinum. A controlled manufacturing process has been developed for the 
therapeutic toxin which is specially formulated to give a freeze-dried product 
having good stability."
1316274,"The decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II is essential for viability as 
eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Phosphorylation has been shown to stimulate 
topoisomerase II activity in vitro. Here we show that topoisomerase II is a 
phosphoprotein in yeast and that the level of incorporated phosphate is 
significantly higher at mitosis than in G1. Comparison of tryptic phosphopeptide 
maps reveals that the major phosphorylation sites in vivo are targets for casein 
kinase II. Incorporation of phosphate into topoisomerase II is nearly 
undetectable at the non-permissive temperature in a conditional casein kinase II 
mutant. The sites modified by casein kinase II are located in the extreme 
C-terminal domain of topoisomerase II. This domain is absent in prokaryotic and 
highly divergent among eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, and may serve to 
regulate functions of topoisomerase II that are unique to eukaryotic cells."
1317658,"Hypothalamic hormones as well as anterior pituitary hormones were detected in 
the peripheral plasma after the diagnosis of brain death. It is possible that 
residual hypothalamic tissue was functioning after satisfying the usual criteria 
of total brain death. To examine this possibility, endocrinological and 
morphological alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary system was evaluated in 
28 brain dead patients. Intrinsic ADH was depleted in the plasma shortly after 
the diagnosis of brain death. Anterior pituitary hormones were initially 
detected in all patients, but gradually disappeared. The direct TRH (thyrotropin 
releasing hormone) stimulation to the anterior lobe was responded to well. 
Morphological studies showed a partial necrosis of the anterior lobe and the 
preservation of the posterior lobe for as long as a week. These data prove that 
the pituitary is partially preserved after brain death. LH-RH (luteinizing 
hormone releasing hormone) was detected in the peripheral plasma of all patients 
and GRF (growth hormone releasing factor) was detected in half of the patients 
for as long as 15 days, but autopsy revealed the fact that the brain tissue 
including the hypothalamus became extensively necrotic after the sixth day of 
brain death. In order to solve this controversy it is proposed that these 
hormones originate from extracranial tissues such as pancreas. The detection of 
hypothalamic hormones after the diagnosis of brain death therefore is not 
contradictory to the concept of total brain death."
1318542,"The short-term hemodynamic effects of intravenous enalaprilat were assessed in 
26 infants and children, aged 6 months to 15 years, with intracardiac shunts 
undergoing cardiac catheterization. Pulmonary and systemic pressure, flow, and 
resistance indices were measured by the direct Fick method before and 30 min 
after enalaprilat at 0.06 mg/kg. Aortic and pulmonary artery pressure decreased 
15 and 20%, respectively, by 10 min, with little further change at 30 min. The 
heart rate did not change significantly and there was no reduction in systemic 
flow. In those with a large ventricular septal defect and normal or near-normal 
pulmonary resistance (less than 3.5 u.m2, n = 8), the mean pulmonary-systemic 
flow ratio decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) and the 
mean left-to-right shunt from 7.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.9 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2 (p less than 
0.02). Those with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than 5 
u.m2, n = 8) showed a varied response. Two children, both with Down's syndrome, 
an atrioventricular canal defect, and reversible pulmonary hypertension (as 
assessed by an infusion of isoproterenol), had no decrease in pulmonary vascular 
resistance with enalaprilat. There were no adverse effects. Converting enzyme 
inhibitors may benefit ""heart failure"" associated with large ventricular septal 
defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance."
1318636,"Utilizing the whole-cell patch-clamp method we assessed the Ca2+ current (ICa) 
in well-established cell lines from human small-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the 
lung, NCI-H209 and NCI-H187. The Ca2+ current was readily observed in H209 
tumour cells (90% of the cells tested), whereas H187 tumour cells only 
occasionally expressed Ca2+ channels (26% of the cells tested). H209 Ca2+ 
current was evoked by potentials greater than -30 mV and exhibited partial 
inactivation over the duration of a 40 ms command potential. This inward current 
was unchanged by alteration of the holding potential from -80 to -40 mV and the 
activation phase of the Ca2+ current was best fitted by Hodgkin-Huxley m(t)2 
kinetics. H209 Ca2+ current was reduced over 80% by verapamil (100 microM), 
whereas w-conotoxin (5 microM) appeared to be without effect. In contrast, H209 
Ca2+ current was rapidly abolished by nifedipine (10 microM), strongly 
suggesting the presence of L-type Ca2+ channels. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may 
be important to the secretion of ectopic hormones and the etiology and 
pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of the motor 
nerve terminal in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca2+ 
channels are produced."
1320716,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone with natriuretic and 
diuretic effects. To better define the ANP hormonal system in the nephrotic 
syndrome, a condition associated with renal sodium retention, we undertook a 
study of glomerular ANP receptors in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced 
nephrotic syndrome and in pair-fed controls. Nephrotic rats had significantly 
decreased serum albumin and total protein and significantly increased serum 
cholesterol, triglycerides and 24 hour urinary protein excretion. Plasma level 
of atrial natriuretic peptide was similar in both groups of rats. Competition 
binding inhibition studies in isolated glomeruli demonstrated one binding site 
in both groups of rats. The density of ANP binding sites in isolated glomeruli 
was similar in nephrotic and pair-fed rats while the binding affinity was 
increased significantly in the nephrotic rats. This is the first study to 
demonstrate alterations in renal ANP receptors in the nephrotic syndrome. 
Further studies will be necessary to determine whether alterations in glomerular 
ANP receptors contribute to renal sodium retention in the nephrotic syndrome."
1321044,"Thyroid hormone is one of the few known physiological regulators of mammalian 
mitochondrial biogenesis. Although it exerts a global effect on biogenesis, it 
does so by regulating the expression of a limited number of unidentified 
mitochondrial proteins. We have investigated these hormone-regulated proteins in 
rat liver. Hormone injection induced a 30-fold increase in the levels of 
cytochrome-c1 mRNA after 3 d. In addition, the mRNA for the growth-activated 
adenine-nucleotide translocator, ANT2, was increased 13-fold and that for the 
ATPase N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein increased 4-5-fold. 
Mitochondrial transcripts of cytochrome-oxidase subunit I also increased. No 
changes were found in the mRNA levels for the F1-ATPase beta-subunit or 
cytochrome oxidase IV. A single low dose of triiodothyronine induces rapid 
increases in cytochrome-c1 and ANT2 mRNA species which parallel changes in the 
activity of the hormone-responsive malic enzyme, but are earlier than other 
mitochondrial biogenetic events. These data strengthen the view that thyroid 
hormone regulates synthesis of specific components within each respiratory-chain 
complex and that these products apparently play key roles in inner-membrane 
biogenesis and assembly. The significance of ANT2 induction is also discussed 
with respect to the rapid respiratory response induced by thyroid hormone."
1324836,"Diphenylene iodonium (Ph2I), a lipophilic reagent, is an efficient inhibitor of 
the production of O2- by the activated NADPH oxidase of bovine neutrophils. In a 
cell-free system of NADPH oxidase activation consisting of neutrophil membranes 
and cytosol from resting cells, supplemented with guanosine 
5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, MgCl2 and arachidonic acid, or in membranes 
isolated from neutrophils activated by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 
addition of a reducing agent, e.g. NADPH or sodium dithionite, markedly enhanced 
inhibition of the NADPH oxidase by Ph2I. The membrane fraction was found to 
contain the Ph2I-sensitive component(s). In the presence of a concentration of 
Ph2I sufficient to fully inhibit O2- production (around 10 nmol/mg membrane 
protein), addition of catalytic amounts of the redox mediator dichloroindophenol 
(Cl2Ind) resulted in a by-pass of the electron flow to cytochrome c, the rate of 
which was about half of that determined in non-inhibited oxidase. A marked 
increase in the efficiency of this by-pass was achieved by addition of sodium 
deoxycholate. The Cl2-Ind-mediated cytochrome c reduction was negligible in 
membranes isolated from resting neutrophils. At a higher concentration of Ph2I 
(100 nmol/mg membrane protein), the Cl2Ind-mediated cytochrome c reductase 
activity was only half inhibited, which indicated that, in the NADPH oxidase 
complex, there are at least two Ph2I sensitive components, differing by their 
sensitivity to the inhibitor. At low concentrations of Ph2I (less than 10 
nmol/mg protein), the spectrum of reduced cytochrome b558 in isolated neutrophil 
membranes was modified, suggesting that the component sensitive to low 
concentrations of Ph2I is the heme binding component of cytochrome b558. Higher 
concentrations of Ph2I were found to inhibit the isolated NADPH dehydrogenase 
component of the oxidase complex. A number of membrane and cytosolic proteins 
were labeled by [125I]Ph2I. However, the radiolabeling of a membrane-bound 
24-kDa protein, which might be the small subunit of cytochrome b558, responded 
more specifically to the conditions of activation and reduction which are 
required for inhibition of O2- production by Ph2I. The O2(-)-generating form of 
xanthine oxidase was also inhibited by Ph2I. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase, a 
non-heme iron flavoprotein, by Ph2I had a number of features in common with that 
of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, namely the requirement of reducing conditions 
for inhibition of O2- production by Ph2I and the induction of a by-pass of 
electron flow to cytochrome c by Cl2Ind in the inhibited enzyme, suggesting some 
similarity in the molecular organization of the two enzymes."
1327232,"The problem of the drug induced pulmonary toxicity (cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic 
drugs) is discussed. This domain of modern pathology is in continuous 
development, although yet insufficiently delineated. The essential pathogenic 
mechanisms are presented as well as the main histopathological lesions (i.e., 
interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis). The usual lesional aspects 
specific to certain drugs are also reviewed. For the principal chemical 
substances in this category, the clinical and radiological aspects are given, 
also the various treatment indicated, the evolution and the prognosis of the 
drugs induced pulmonary disease."
1328854,"In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the muscle-specific 
subunit of the human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) gene, chimeric genes 
composed of the upstream region of the PGAM-M gene and the bacterial 
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were constructed and transfected 
into C2C12 skeletal myocytes, primary cultured cardiac muscle cells, and 
C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. The expression of chimeric reporter genes was restricted 
in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. In C2C12 myotubes and primary cultured 
cardiac muscle cells, the segment between nucleotides -165 and +41 relative to 
the transcription initiation site was sufficient to confer maximal CAT activity. 
This region contains two E boxes and one MEF-2 motif. Deletion and substitution 
mutation analysis showed that a single MEF-2 motif but not the E boxes had a 
substantial effect on skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific enhancer activity and 
that the cardiac muscle-specific negative regulatory region was located between 
nucleotides -505 and -165. When the PGAM-M gene constructs were cotransfected 
with MyoD into C3H10T1/2, the profile of CAT activity was similar to that 
observed in C2C12 myotubes. Gel mobility shift analysis revealed that when the 
nuclear extracts from skeletal and cardiac muscle cells were used, the PGAM-M 
MEF-2 site generated the specific band that was inhibited by unlabeled PGAM-M 
MEF-2 and muscle creatine kinase MEF-2 oligomers but not by a mutant PGAM-M 
MEF-2 oligomer. These observations define the PGAM-M enhancer as the only 
cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific enhancer characterized thus far that is 
mainly activated through MEF-2."
1328936,"Five patients with pseudo-Bartter's syndrome from surreptitious diuretic abuse 
were compared with six patients with true Bartter's syndrome, diagnosed as a 
normotensive, hyperreninaemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal 
urine chloride excretion, low CH2O/(CH2O+CCl) ratio during maximal water 
diuresis and negative urine screen for diuretics. The latter was positive for 
frusemide in four and for hydrochlorothiazide in the remaining pseudo-Bartter's 
patients. The two groups of patients did not differ as for plasma Na+, Cl-, K+, 
HCO3-, renin, and aldosterone, while uric acid and Mg2+ were greater in 
pseudo-Bartter's patients. Daily and fasting urine Na+, Cl- and K+ excretion 
were less in pseudo-Bartter's patients; however, there was substantial overlap 
of values between the two groups. Fractional distal solute reabsorption during 
maximal water diuresis was low in the six patients with Bartter's syndrome and 
in two pseudo-Bartter's patients; thus, this parameter could not be taken as a 
specific diagnostic marker of Bartter's syndrome. Frusemide administration, 40 
mg i.v., induced a brisk increase of urine flow (11.7-21.8 ml/min), UOsm 
(148-186 mOsm/kg H2O) and FENa (14.6-24%) in Bartter's syndrome, but not 
pseudo-Bartter's patients; in all pseudo-Bartter's patients frusemide-induced 
changes of UOsm (13-97) and FENa (-0.5 to 10.2) were markedly less than in 
Bartter's syndrome patients. Frusemide resistance in pseudo-Bartter's patients 
was most probably related to diuretic-induced ECF volume contraction and 
increased proximal tubule solute reabsorption; in fact fractional lithium 
clearance (FELi, a marker of post-proximal solute delivery) was low in 
pseudo-Bartter's, but not in Bartter's syndrome patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

1330823,"The SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified 
originally by mutations that suppress delta insertion mutations at HIS4 and 
LYS2. Subsequent analysis has demonstrated that spt4, spt5 and spt6 mutations 
confer similar pleiotropic phenotypes. They suppress delta insertion mutations 
by altering transcription and are believed to be required for normal 
transcription of several other loci. We have now analyzed interactions between 
SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6. First, the combination of mutations in any two of these 
three genes causes lethality in haploids. Second, some recessive mutations in 
different members of this set fail to complement each other. Third, mutations in 
all three genes alter transcription in similar ways. Finally, the results of 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that at least the SPT5 and SPT6 
proteins interact physically. Taken together, these genetic and biochemical 
results indicate that SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 function together in a transcriptional 
process that is essential for viability in yeast."
1331501,"Studies of adenovirus E1A oncoprotein mutants suggest that the association of 
E1A with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is necessary for E1A-mediated 
transformation. Mutational analysis of E1A indicates that two regions of pRB are 
required for E1A to form stable complexes with the retinoblastoma protein. In 
addition to pRB binding, these regions are necessary for E1A association with 
several other cellular proteins, including p130, p107, cyclin A, and p33cdk2. 
Here we show that short synthetic peptides containing the pRB-binding sequences 
of E1A are sufficient for interaction with p107, cyclin A, and p130. The E7 
protein of human papillomavirus type 16 contains an element that binds to pRB 
and appears to be functionally homologous to the E1A sequences. Peptides 
containing this region of the E7 protein were able to interact with p107, cyclin 
A, and p130 in addition to pRB. These findings suggest that the common mechanism 
of transformation used by these viral oncogenes involves their association with 
a set of polypeptides."
1331777,"Biogenesis of mitochondria involves the expression of genes located on nuclear 
chromosomes as well as on mitochondrial DNA. We studied the coordination of the 
two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and 
mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the 
mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of 
the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in 
hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) 
treatment. However, significant increases in the levels of all nuclear 
transcripts were observed in the liver 24 h after T3 treatment, but were delayed 
or remained unaltered (VIc) in muscle. In contrast, levels of mitochondrial 
transcripts were elevated early in muscle and late in liver. The abundance of 
the corresponding polypeptides, which were analyzed by immunoblotting, changed 
in direction and magnitude according to the changes in their mRNAs, indicating 
pretranslational control. We conclude that the two genomes are regulated by T3 
not through a common coordinating mechanism, but via two separate pathways, 
which respond to T3 with tissue-specific kinetics. S1-nuclease protection 
analysis showed that probably only one transcript for subunit VIc is present in 
both tissues, thus excluding the possibility that the tissue-specific response 
is due to the expression of two isogenes. The abundance of mitochondrial DNA was 
unaltered despite the observed changes in mitochondrial transcripts, indicating 
that mitochondrial gene expression is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms 
and not by gene dosage as has been postulated by others."
1332607,"The gene encoding topoisomerase II in yeast is unique and essential, required 
for both mitotic and meiotic proliferation. The use of temperature-sensitive 
mutants in topoisomerase II have demonstrated roles in the relaxation of 
tortional stress, reduction of recombination rates, and in the separation of 
sister chromatids after replication. In vertebrate cells, topoisomerase II was 
shown to be the most abundant component of the metaphase chromosomal scaffold, 
and has been shown to play a role in chromosome condensation in vitro. The cell 
cycle control of chromosome condensation may well require phosphorylation of 
topoisomerase II, since the enzyme is more highly phosphorylated in metaphase 
than in G1. Recent studies have identified casein kinase II as the major enzyme 
phosphorylating topoisomerase II in intact yeast cells. The target sites of CKII 
are exclusively in the C-terminal 400 amino acids of topoisomerase II, the 
region that is most divergent among the eukaryotic type II enzymes and which is 
absent in the bacterial gyrase homologues."
1333560,"The effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 human 
erythroleukemic cell was studied to understand why the erythrocyte sodium pump 
activity is decreased in hyperthyroidism. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cell 
lysates was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from 
ATP. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cell grown in the presence of T3 for 48 
hours was significantly higher than that of control (0.98 +/- 0.05 mumol Pi h-1 
mg protein-1 vs 0.82 +/- 0.10 mumol Pi h-1 mg protein-1, p < 0.05). The 
Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity could be stimulated in a time- and 
concentration-dependent manner; maximum stimulatory effect of T3 was seen at a 
concentration of 10(-7) mol/L. When an inducer 
[cytosine-beta-D-arabino-furanoside (ARA-C)] was added to the culture medium, 
the K562 cells showed signs of differentiation and synthesised haemoglobin. At 
the same time, the Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity remained high. We conclude that T3 
stimulates Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cells and in the presence of T3 
during differentiation, the enzyme activity remains high."
1333942,"The Askin tumor, a primitive malignant small-cell tumor of the chest wall, is 
mostly seen among children and adolescents. It is closely related to Ewing's 
sarcoma of the same location, both tumors showing a chromosomal translocation 
t(11;22). Its origin from neuroectodermal cells is deducted from several 
ultrastructural details and from the expression of specific markers like NSE. 
Pain and deformation of the chest wall are the cardinal clinical signs of the 
tumor. Chest X-rays will frequently show destruction of ribs and pleural 
effusions. Effective therapy consists of radical surgery, local radiation and 
adjuvant chemotherapy. This multimodal concept allows minority of patients to 
remain disease-free but the overall outcome is rather unfortunate."
1334264,"In eukaryotic cells, protein secretion provides a complex organizational 
problem. Secretory proteins are first transported, in an unfolded state, across 
the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and are then carried in small 
vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and finally to the cell membrane. The ER 
contains soluble proteins which catalyse the folding of newly synthesized 
polypeptides. These proteins are sorted from secretory proteins in the Golgi 
complex: they carry a sorting signal (the tetrapeptide KDEL or a related 
sequence) that allows them to be selectively retrieved and returned to the ER. 
This retrieval process also appears to be used by some bacterial toxins to aid 
their invasion of the cell: these toxins contain KDEL-like sequences and may, in 
effect, follow the secretory pathway in reverse. The membrane-bound receptor 
responsible for sorting luminal ER proteins has been identified in yeast by 
genetic means, and related receptors are found in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, 
this receptor has a second role: in yeast it is required to maintain the normal 
size and function of the Golgi apparatus. By helping to maintain the composition 
of both ER and Golgi compartments, the KDEL receptor has an important role in 
the organization of the secretory pathway."
1337231,"We have constructed recombinant baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses containing 
cloned DNA, encoding either the envelope protein alone or all of the structural 
proteins (core, membrane and envelope) of louping ill virus. Glycosylated viral 
envelope protein, presented both inside and on the surface of insect and 
mammalian cells, was expressed by all four recombinant viruses. Differences in 
antigenic presentation of the envelope protein were observed between the 
envelope protein and structural protein constructs as well as between the insect 
and mammalian cell expression systems. Despite the expression of epitopes known 
to elicit neutralizing and protective antibodies when present in authentic 
antigen, the recombinant envelope protein expressed by either vector failed to 
induce, in mice or rabbits, either neutralizing or protective antibodies against 
louping ill virus."
1337883,"We operationally define two forms of SV40 minichromosomes, a 75S-form, prepared 
at low salt concentration, referred to as native minichromosomes, and a 
50S-form, obtained after treatment with 0.5 M potassium acetate, the 
salt-treated minichromosomes. Both preparations of minichromosomes serve well as 
templates for replication in vitro. Their respective replication products are 
strikingly different: replicated native minichromosomes contain a densely packed 
array of the maximal number of nucleosomes whereas replicated salt-treated 
minichromosomes carry, on average, half of the maximal number. We conclude that 
in both cases parental nucleosomes are transferred to progeny DNA, and, in 
addition, that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurs during the replication of 
native minichromosomes. This is apparently due to the presence of a nucleosome 
assembly factor as a constituent of native minichromosomes that dissociates upon 
treatment with salt. We further show that preparations of minichromosomes 
usually contain significant amounts of copurifying hnRNP particles and SV40 
virion precursor particles. However, these structures do not detectably affect 
the replication and the chromatin assembly reactions."
1339000,"Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a myasthenia-like syndrome of paraneoplastic origin 
which is often associated with anaplastic small-cell lung cancer. It seems to be 
an autoimmune disease responsible for a deficit of acetylcholine ejection in the 
motor end plate. On the occasion of two recent cases, we review the clinical, 
physiopathological and diagnostic aspects of this paraneoplastic syndrome."
1341423,"Despite the common practice of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the unique 
phenomenon of punctate black pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa, now known as 
pseudomelanosis duodeni, still remains a rare entity. Four patients with normal 
renal function at presentation were found to have this pigment on endoscopy. One 
developed renal failure subsequently but the pigmentation persisted and this 
observation has not been reported before. Histochemical and ultrastructural 
studies were made. It is postulated that the pigment is heterogenous and 
represents a form of stored iron. Anti-hypertensive drugs may have a role in the 
causation of the pigmentation formation."
1345168,"Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation is thought to be controlled by the X 
inactivation centre (XIC, X-controlling element -Xce-in mice). A human gene, 
XIST and its mouse counterpart, Xist, which map to the XIC/Xce, are expressed 
exclusively from inactive X chromosomes, suggesting their involvement in the 
process of X-inactivation. We now report the presence of Xist/XIST transcripts 
in newborn and adult mouse testes, and in human testicular tissue with normal 
spermatogenesis, but not in the testes of patients who lack germ cells. Our 
results indicate that while the X chromosome in males is active in somatic 
cells, it undergoes inactivation during spermatogenesis."
1345899,"The etiology of idiopathic scoliosis remains unknown. The condition results in a 
characteristic deformity of the spine and surrounding tissues. Both Types I and 
II collagen are important constituents of the affected tissues, and thus 
defective collagens are reasonable candidates for the primary abnormality in 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Direct analyses of the amount and 
solubility of collagen have revealed differences between normal individuals and 
those with AIS. However, these changes may be secondary to the mechanical 
effects of the spinal deformity. Segregation analysis was done of genetic 
markers linked to the structural genes encoding Types I and II collagen to test 
these candidate loci in four pedigrees with dominantly inherited AIS. In one 
pedigree, markers linked to both of the Type I collagen loci (COL1A1 and COL1A2) 
were found to be inherited independently of the abnormal phenotype. Two 
pedigrees were discordant at one of the Type I loci. The condition also 
segregated independently of the locus for Type II collagen (COL2A1) in three 
pedigrees. This is evidence against idiopathic scoliosis generally being caused 
by mutations in the Types I and II collagen genes."
1346886,"Lithium carbonate is an effective drug for prophylaxis and treatment of major 
affective disorders. In-utero exposure to lithium during the first trimester of 
pregnancy might be associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, 
especially the rare Ebstein's anomaly. We prospectively recruited and followed 
148 women (mean age 30 years, SD 5 range 15-40) using lithium during the first 
trimester of pregnancy, who consulted four teratogen information centres in the 
USA and Canada. Pregnancy outcome was compared with that of controls matched for 
maternal age. We had complete follow-up of pregnancy outcome in 138 of 148 
patients recruited. In the other 10, fetal echocardiograms were available but 
postnatal follow-up was not done. Mean daily dose of lithium was 927 mg (SD 
340). Rates of major congenital malformations did not differ between the lithium 
(2.8%) and control (2.4%) groups. 1 patient in the lithium group chose to 
terminate pregnancy after Ebstein's anomaly was detected by a prenatal 
echocardiogram. There was 1 ventricular septal defect in the controls. 
Birthweight was significantly higher in the lithium-exposed infants than in the 
controls despite identical gestational ages (3475 [660] g vs 3383 [566] g, p = 
0.02). The true difference in birthweight might have been even larger, since 
significantly more women using lithium than controls were cigarette smokers 
(31.8% vs 15.5%, p = 0.002). These results indicate that lithium is not an 
important human teratogen. Women with major affective disorders who wish to have 
children may continue lithium therapy, provided that adequate screening tests, 
including level II ultrasound and fetal echocardiography, are done."
1347910,"Fatal familial insomnia (FFI), a condition characterized by inability to sleep, 
dysautonomia, motor disturbances, and selective thalamic atrophy is a prion 
disease linked to a GAC----AAC mutation at codon 178 of the prion gene. These 
data were obtained from one kindred. We now report a second kindred affected by 
FFI and carrying the same mutation. The finding of the same disease phenotype 
and genotype in a second family further validates FFI as a distinct disease 
entity and a phenotype of the GAC----AAC mutation at codon 178 of the prion 
gene."
1348618,"Dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, two enzymes of the pyrimidine 
biosynthetic pathway, were purified from Plasmodium berghei to apparent 
homogeneity. Orotate and a series of 5-substituted derivatives were found to 
inhibit competitively the purified enzymes from the malaria parasite. The order 
of effectiveness as inhibitors on pyrimidine ring cleavage reaction for 
dihydroorotase was 5-fluoro orotate greater than 5-amino orotate, 5-methyl 
orotate greater than orotate greater than 5-bromo orotate greater than 5-iodo 
orotate with Ki values of 65, 142, 166, 860, 2200 and greater than 3500 microM, 
respectively. 5-Fluoro orotate and orotate were the most effective inhibitors 
for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. In vitro, 5-fluoro orotate and 5-amino orotate 
caused 50% inhibition of the growth of P. falciparum at concentrations of 10 nM 
and 1 microM, respectively. In mice infected with P. berghei, these two orotate 
analogs at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight eliminated parasitemia after a 4-day 
treatment, an effect comparable to that of the same dose of chloroquine. The 
infected mice treated with 5-fluoro orotate at a lower dose of 2.5 mg/kg had a 
95% reduction in parasitemia. The effects of the more potent compounds tested in 
combination with inhibitors of other enzymes of this pathway on P. falciparum in 
vitro and P. berghei in vivo are currently under investigation. These results 
suggest that the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the malarial parasite may be 
a target for the design of antimalarial drugs."
1348847,"DOPA was measured in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamic-hypophysial portal 
blood after treatment with NSD-1015, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. NSD-1015 
caused DOPA to accumulate in the anterior pituitary of mice and rats, and 
increased DOPA in the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood of rat. Serum 
prolactin was also increased. Interruption of the anterior pituitary blood 
supply from the hypothalamic-hypophysial system by cannulation of the entire 
pituitary stalk eliminated the NSD-1015-induced DOPA accumulation in the rat 
pituitary. We conclude that DOPA can be taken into the anterior pituitary from 
the portal blood of NSD-1015-treated rodents and that the anterior pituitary 
lacks tyrosine hydroxylase activity in both mice and rats."
1354979,"Anterograde amnesia, possibly accompanied by acute brain syndrome, is a 
potential side-effect of certain benzodiazepines, particularly triazolam. 
Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing 
the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. We report a case 
of triazolam overdose resulting in anterograde amnesia after flumazenil 
administration had restored clear consciousness. The defect in memory may have 
been due to too little flumazenil being given or failure of memory consolidation 
affected by the character of triazolam during the induced lucent period. We feel 
that physicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of acute brain 
syndrome in patients with benzodiazepine overdose despite treatment with 
flumazenil."
1355324,"Using monoclonal antibodies (MoABs) against blood group determinants and related 
carbohydrate sequences, it is now possible to clarify their carcinoma-associated 
modulation at a molecular level. In the present study a panel of MoABs against 
different type 1 chain derived blood group antigens, comprising A, B, H type 1, 
Le(a), sialyl-Le(a) (CA 19-9), sialyl type 1 structure (CA 50), and Le(b) was 
used to investigate their immunoreactivity in 38 medullary carcinomas of the 
thyroid (MTC) and in normal thyroid tissue. The antigens were not expressed in 
normal follicular or C-cells but were expressed to a various extent in MTC. The 
studies revealed some characteristic anomalies in the frequency and patterns of 
tumor-associated antigen expression. The MoAB C 50 stained 32 of the 38 tumors, 
H type 1 (Le(d)) was demonstrated in 21 and the Le(b) antigen in 27. The Le(a)- 
and the A antigen were detected in 10 and 12 tumors and the B antigen in one. 
From the results some rules about the pathways for tumor-associated 
re-expression of these antigens can be deduced. Le(a) antigen expression was 
significantly correlated with the CA 50 and Le(b) antigens. The significant 
relation observed between A-, H1-, and Le(b) antigen formation in MTC suggests 
the existence of a carcinoma-associated fucosyltransferase committing the type 1 
precursor chain along the H1-antigen pathway, and by further glycosylation to an 
A-, B-, or a Le(b) antigen. Comparative studies of tumor-associated H type 1 and 
H type 2 antigen expression revealed that H type 2 antigen synthesis was 
significantly related to a blood type 0 in the host. On the other hand, H1 
antigen reactivity was independent of the AB0 blood type of the hosts and was 
also detected in H type 2 antigen-negative tumors. These findings support the 
proposal that even in tumor tissue, H antigen expression is still determined by 
the interaction of at least two different genes. Despite the occurrence of the 
precursor substance (CA 50) and the formation of the Le(a)- and Le(b) antigens, 
indicating the presence of a alpha 1,4-fucosyl-transferase (Lewis-enzyme), only 
two tumors showed the formation of CA 19-9. In conclusion, the investigations 
demonstrated the dominant re-expression of three type 1 chain-derived structures 
in MTC, namely H type 1, Le(b), and CA 50. These findings support the general 
concept demonstrated in other carcinomas, that fucosyl- and sialyltransferases 
are preferentially activated in MTC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
1357067,"Using medium with a low ionic strength, a low concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 
devoid of K+, we have measured Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in the homogenates of rat 
islets preincubated for 3 min with several hormones in the presence of 3.3 mmol 
glucose/l. Insulin secretion was also measured in islets incubated for 5 min 
under identical experimental conditions. Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 
mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 
nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine 
(1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those 
preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the 
release of insulin significantly. Dexamethasone (0.1 mumol/l) and somatostatin 
(1.2 mumol/l) enhanced the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity while adrenaline (10 mumol/l) 
did not produce any significant effect on the activity of the enzyme. These 
hormones decreased the release of insulin significantly. These results 
demonstrated that islet Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was modulated by the hormones 
tested. Their inhibitory or enhancing effect seemed to be related to their 
effect on insulin secretion; i.e. those which stimulated the secretion of 
insulin inhibited the activity of the enzyme and vice versa. Hence, their effect 
on insulin secretion may be due, in part, to their effect on enzyme activity and 
consequently on the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. These results reinforce the 
assumption that Ca(2+)-ATPase activity participates in the physiological 
regulation of insulin secretion, being one of the cellular targets for several 
agents which affect this process."
1357906,"Myocardial pump deficiency is regarded to be the hemodynamic hallmark of 
congestive heart failure. A decline of arterial pressure in the systemic 
circulation is counter-regulated by vasoconstriction in the arteriolar vascular 
bed; the compensatory vasoconstriction, however, results in an increased 
afterload that in turn aggravates myocardial pump deficiency. As part of the 
counterregulatory systems the sympathetic nervous system is activated (increase 
of neuronal activity, increased plasma norepinephrine) and the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated as well (increased plasma 
renin activity, elevated angiotensin II serum levels, hyperaldosteronism). In 
parallel, serum levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is despite a serum 
hypoosmolarity increased and only poorly compensated by release of the atrial 
natriuretic peptide. On the cellular level, congestive heart failure leads to a 
shift of the expression of contractile proteins towards to fetal forms (for 
instance myosin-isoenzymes). Although the counterregulatory activation of the 
neuroendocrine systems vasoconstricts the peripheral arteries thereby 
maintaining perfusion of vital organs, the rise in afterload ultimately leads to 
a progression of congestive heart failure. Consequently, vasodilators (such as 
ACE-inhibitors) that not only induce vasodilation in the peripheral arteries, 
but also inhibit progressive neuroendocrine stimulation evolved as excellent 
compounds for treating congestive heart failure."
1363224,"One-year open Multicentric Isradipine Study (MIS) performed in 7 centres in 
Czechoslovakia included 144 patients with mild and moderate hypertension. 
Isradipine was given at a dose of 2.5 mg daily. If normalization of diastolic 
blood pressure (BP) had not been reached, the dosage was increased to 5 mg. 
Monotherapy with isradipine normalized diastolic BP in 44% of patients. 
Isradipine (5 mg daily) was combined with bopindolol in patients in whom 
isradipine alone failed to normalize diastolic BP. These had higher mean 
systolic and diastolic BP, body weight, erythrocyte and platelet counts at the 
beginning of the study. The combination of isradipine with bopindolol normalized 
diastolic BP in 87% of the group at the end of 48 weeks' treatment. Tolerance 
was excellent in 82% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 8% patients, 
undesirable effects being the reason in 2%, ineffective therapy in 2% and poor 
adherence to therapy in 4%. Isradipine in monotherapy or in combination with 
bopindolol did not exert an adverse effect on the metabolic risk factors of 
ischaemic heart disease (cholesterol, glycaemia)."
1366363,"The continuous itaconic acid production from sucrose with Aspergillus terreus 
TKK 200-5-3 mycelium immobilized on polyurethane foam cubes was optimized in 
column bioreactors using statistical experimental design and empirical 
modelling. The highest itaconic acid product concentration calculated on the 
basis of the obtained model was 15.8 g l-1 in the investigated experimental 
area, when sucrose concentration was 13.5%, aeration rate 150 ml min-1 and 
residence time 178 h. From sucrose with immobilized A. terreus TKK 200-5-3 
mycelium itaconic acid production was stable for at least 4.5 months in 
continuous column bioreactors. In comparison, using glucose as substrate and 
immobilized A. terreus TKK 200-5-1 mycelium as biocatalyst similar stability was 
obtained with higher product concentration. The omission of copper sulphate from 
the production medium gave the highest itaconic acid product concentration (26 g

1371280,"In addition to polynucleotide polymerization, DNA polymerases and bacterial RNA 
polymerase can also remove nucleotides from the growing end of nucleic acid 
chains. For DNA polymerases this activity is an important factor in establishing 
fidelity in DNA synthesis. This report describes a novel in vitro activity of 
RNA polymerase II whereby it cleaves an RNA chain contained within an active 
elongation complex. These elongation complexes are arrested at a previously 
identified, naturally occurring transcriptional pause site in a human gene. The 
new 3'-end revealed by this cleavage remains associated with an active 
elongation complex and is capable of being extended by RNA polymerase II. 
Nascent RNA cleavage is evident after removal of free nucleotides and is 
dependent upon a divalent metal cation and transcription elongation factor SII. 
This function of SII could be important in its function as an activator of 
transcription elongation. It is also possible that the transcript cleavage 
activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme."
1371285,"Carbocyclic 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine (carbovir, NSC 614846) is an 
anti-retroviral agent that may be useful in the treatment of AIDS. We have 
examined the ability of (-)-enantiomeric carbovir triphosphate to inhibit human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49). A 
comparison of inhibition kinetics was made with 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine 
triphosphate and phosphonoformate. Inhibition of the reverse transcriptase was 
evaluated using poly(rA).oligo(dT)12-18, poly(rC).oligo(dG)12-18, or influenza 
virion RNA template with a specific oligodeoxynucleotide as primer. (-)-Carbovir 
5'-triphosphate was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase with an apparent Ki similar to that of 
3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. Chain elongation studies utilizing 
an MS2 RNA template showed that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate terminated 
transcription at positions identical to those where dideoxy-GTP terminated. This 
indicates that (-)-carbovir 5'-monophosphate is incorporated into the newly 
synthesized DNA and terminates transcription at that point. We conclude that 
(-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase enzyme and that (-)-carbovir most likely inhibits HIV by activity 
at the triphosphate level by a combination of direct competition for binding of 
the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the reverse transcriptase and chain 
termination."
1376017,"To determine the nature and frequency of non-delta F508 cystic fibrosis (CF) 
mutations among diverse populations, we have sequenced exons 9-12 and 19-23 of 
the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene from 128 CF chromosomes 
(39 U.S. Caucasian, 27 African-American, 42 Northern Irish, and 20 Israeli 
chromosomes). These regions were chosen because they encode the two putative 
ATP-binding folds of CFTR, domains which appear to have functional significance. 
In addition, CFTR exons 1 and 2 were analyzed in the American patients. 
Mutations were found on 49 of the 128 CF chromosomes. Nineteen different 
mutations were observed; six were novel, while the remaining 13 had been 
reported previously by our group or by other investigators. Six of nine 
different mutations found in African-American patients were unique to that 
population. However, the vast majority of the mutations found in U.S. Caucasians 
(eight of nine), Northern Irish (four of five), and Israelis (three of three) 
also occurred in other Caucasian groups. The preponderance of previously 
reported mutations in these three groups suggested that a subset of the 
non-delta F508 mutations occur in common among Caucasians. A survey of mutation 
frequencies in other Caucasian groups confirmed this observation. Unfortunately, 
this subset accounts for less than half of non-delta F508 CF mutations in most 
groups. These data suggest that screening for delta F508 and this select group 
of mutations will efficiently and economically maximize the number of CF 
mutations identified in Caucasian groups. However, it will be difficult to 
detect more than 90% of mutant CFTR alleles except in ethnically and 
geographically discrete populations where CF is the result of founder effect."
1377459,"A review of 52 patients with gastric lymphoma at the Texas A&M University 
College of Medicine Affiliated Scott and White Memorial Hospital (Temple, TX). 
was performed to determine the influence of different treatment modalities. 
Thirty-one patients had a potentially curative resection, while 21 underwent a 
palliative procedure or biopsy alone. Overall 5-year survival was 73.4 per cent 
after curative resection and 38.3 per cent for lesser operative procedures (P 
less than .005). Adjuvant radiation was given to 14 patients after curative 
resection with a 5-year survival rate of 71.5 per cent compared to 82.4 per cent 
in the 17 patients treated by curative resection alone (nonsignificant). 
Patients who underwent palliative surgery or biopsy who received postoperative 
radiation therapy had a 38.0 per cent 5-year survival rate compared to a 0.0 per 
cent 5-year survival rate in patients who received no therapy (P = .18). The 
authors conclude that curative resection is the treatment of choice for gastric 
lymphoma, but radiation therapy may offer some benefit when complete resection 
is not feasible."

Dermatophyte infections are common at all ages, in both sexes, and they have a 
worldwide distribution. These infections include tinea capitis, tinea cruris, 
tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea manuum and tinea barbae. Tinea versicolor, 
caused by Malassezia furfur, and candidal infections are also common. Treatment 
modalities include oral and topical agents. Good personal hygiene is an 
important adjunct to antifungal therapy. Decisions regarding the appropriateness 
of therapy in a given patient must take into account the extent and location of 
the infection, the benefits and risks of each of the treatments, and cost. Oral 
therapies include griseofulvin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole. There are a 
large variety of topical treatments, including nystatin, selenium sulfide, 
tolnaftate, haloprogin, miconazole, clotrimazole, and sodium thiosulfate. 
Important to successful treatment is compliance with what is sometimes a long 
course of treatment, and good personal hygiene."
1379232,"Regulation of transcription elongation is an important mechanism in controlling 
eukaryotic gene expression. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that 
stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript 
cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro (Reines, D. 
(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). Here we show that SII-dependent in vitro 
transcription through an arrest site in a human gene is preceded by nascent 
transcript cleavage. RNA cleavage appeared to be an obligatory step in the SII 
activation process. Recombinant SII activated cleavage while a truncated 
derivative lacking polymerase binding activity did not. Cleavage was not 
restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing 
that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II 
elongation complexes. These data support a model whereby SII stimulates 
elongation via a ribonuclease activity of the elongation complex."
1379912,"Alglucerase is a mannose-terminated form of human placental glucocerebrosidase, 
developed to treat patients with Gaucher's disease. Functional 
glucocerebrosidase is deficient in Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive 
lipid storage disorder that affects people of all ethnic backgrounds, but has a 
higher incidence among East European Jews (Ashkenazim). Gaucher's disease 
manifests with hepatosplenomegaly, bleeding disorders and bone disease, with the 
more rare subtypes (types 2 and 3) featuring neurological dysfunction. Prior to 
the development of enzyme replacement therapy, treatment for Gaucher's disease 
was mainly symptomatic relief. Primary treatment with glucocerebrosidase focuses 
on removal of the lipid metabolite that causes the pathology. Because of the 
rarity of Gaucher's disease clinical trials are small, and much of the data 
investigating alglucerase therapy have been obtained from studies of patients 
with type 1 disease, the prevalent subtype. Nonetheless, after intravenous 
administration of alglucerase, improvements are evident within 6 months of 
therapy. Patients have increased haemoglobin levels and platelet counts, and 
decreased incidences of epistaxis and bruising. Spleen and liver size are 
reduced, and skeletal parameters improve. Children gain height and most patients 
receiving alglucerase therapy are able to resume work and daily activities. 
Alglucerase is well tolerated, with few mild adverse reactions reported. 
Although the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information for alglucerase is 
limited, its unequivocal efficacy justifies enzyme replacement therapy with this 
compound as first-line treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease, for whom 
treatment options are limited."
1381443,"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
characterised by intraepidermal blistering of the skin. Two families with 
Weber-Cockayne EBS have been analysed for linkage to keratin gene loci. In the 
first family, linkage was found to chromosome 17 markers flanking the keratin 14 
gene (D17S74: Zmax = +2.45, theta = 0.10; COL1A1: Zmax = +0.97, theta = 0.00) 
and markers near the keratin 5 gene on chromosome 12 were excluded (D12S17: Z 
less than -2.0, theta = 0.08; COL2A1: Z less than -2.0, theta = 0.13). In 
contrast, the second family showed linkage to the region containing the keratin 
5 gene (D12S17: Zmax = +1.37, theta = 0.08; COL2A1: Zmax = +0.33, theta = 0.15) 
and was not linked to the keratin 14 gene (D17S74: Z less than -2.0, theta = 
0.14). The Weber-Cockayne form of EBS is genetically heterogeneous with linkage 
to different keratin gene loci."
1387133,"The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in 
combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was 
evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated 
Mycobacterium avium infection. TLC G-65 was found to be more active than 
amikacin. The combination of rifapentine and TLC G-65 was more active than 
either agent alone. The activity of clarithromycin in combination with TLC G-65 
was similar to that of either agent alone. Clofazimine improved the activity of 
TLC G-65 with respect to the spleen, while ethambutol improved the activity with 
respect to the liver. Clofazimine and ethambutol enhanced the activity of TLC 
G-65 against bacteria in the lungs. TLC G-65 in combination with rifapentine 
appears to be an attractive regimen for the treatment of infections caused by 
bacteria in the M. avium complex."
1388826,"Despite being benign CNS tumours, meningiomas are not always curable and the 
likelihood of recurrence depends upon the completeness of initial removal. 
Adjuvant therapy for incompletely resected meningiomas is generally 
unsatisfactory and such lesions continue to pose difficult management problems. 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been employed in the management of recurrent 
cerebral gliomas but its activity against meningiomas has not been specifically 
studied. An in vitro study of the effects of PDT against a variety of 
meningiomas was therefore conducted. It was found that PDT using 
haematoporphyrin derivative as a photosensitizing drug showed dose-dependent 
activity against a variety of histological subtypes of meningioma. The activity 
of PDT against meningiomas should be investigated further and may eventually 
provide a useful form of adjuvant therapy for incompletely resected lesions."
1392366,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common, severe, inherited disease in the Caucasian 
population. As a consequence, the demand for genetic counselling of patients 
with cystic fibrosis and their families is large. In Denmark the incidence of 
cystic fibrosis is 1:4700, which is quite low compared to other European 
countries. We have investigated 268 Danish cystic fibrosis patients with respect 
to DNA markers (haplotypes) and the most common mutation delta F508. The delta 
F508 mutation is found on 88% of all cystic fibrosis chromosomes, the highest 
frequency reported so far. This had had an important impact on genetic 
counselling, prenatal diagnosis and eventually population screening. In the 
Danish population 78% of all couples at risk will be informative for delta F508 
and will be identifiable by simple screening methods."
1393513,"Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE), a progressive neurological disorder with a 
fatal outcome usually in several months to 6 yrs after disease onset, is seen 
only among the Iakut people of Siberia. The acute meningoencephalitic phase of 
the disease is followed by progressive dementia, rigidity and spastic 
tetraparesis. The disease is characterized by multiple micronecrotic foci with 
marked inflammatory reactions and gliosis in the grey matter. The acute febrile 
onset, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and increased protein in the 
CSF, the epidemiology and the inflammatory neuropathology suggest the disease is 
infectious. Studies on household spread indicate an incubation time of up to 
several years. Viliuisk encephalomyelitis was restricted to an ethically 
distinct group of Iakut people of the Middle Viliui region, but in recent 
decades, with migration from this region, it has been spreading into previously 
unaffected Iakut populations. The occurrence of multiple VE cases in households 
and introduction of the disease by migrants into new populations indicate 
horizontal transmission in a setting of long intimate contact."
1394103,"A 15-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by monosomy 
7 was cytogenetically evaluated by metaphase karyotyping and fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) of interphase cells at six different points during the 
course of his disease. At diagnosis, there was complete agreement between 
metaphase and interphase findings. Interphase analysis alone provided important 
cytogenetic information on the first specimens received following intensive 
combination chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation where metaphase 
analyses were uninformative. The detection of a minor post-treatment monosomy 7 
population by interphase but not metaphase studies may have identified minimal 
residual disease prior to recurrence of MDS. From this longitudinal study, it is 
concluded that metaphase and interphase cytogenetic analyses form complementary 
approaches and that use of both provides greater analytical power when 
appropriate chromosome markers are available."
1394244,"A 46-year-old female motorcyclist, who suffered injuries to the brain stem in a 
traffic accident, showed hypotensive and bradycardiac responses to 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given to counter consciousness disturbance. 
The cardiodepressive responses to TRH were reduced with i.v. pretreatment with 
atropine sulfate, suggesting an involvement of the vagal nervous system in the 
development of the responses. Furthermore, this patient had complicated 
impairments in the sympathetic nervous system, which were revealed by the 
results of testing baroreceptor reflex sensitivity to pharmacological 
alterations in blood pressure. We thus speculate that the hypotensive and 
bradycardiac effects of TRH observed in this patient may result from 
derangements of the sympathetic nervous system caused by the injuries. This case 
report is believed to be a novel description of the cardiodepressive effects of 
TRH."
1395299,"The iliac hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia occurring 
in 1-2% of patients with Factor VIII or Factor IX deficiency. It is frequently 
disabling and life threatening. This report presents a comparative study of 
postoperative results of two cases of hemophilic pseudotumor of ilium. One 
patient undergoing partial resection showed a favorable postoperative course, 
whereas the patient with complete resection of the pseudotumor died of 
postoperative bleeding and sepsis. Studies on the postoperative results of these 
two cases indicate that careful preoperative consideration of tumor size and 
degree of infiltration is of the utmost importance in operative management. 
Early excision of tumors eliminates the possibility of endogenous infection. 
Even partial resection of huge tumors, leaving the lateral wall intact for 
compression, can promote recovery of functions."
1396420,"We studied 36 drop seizures in 5 patients with myoclonic astatic epilepsy of 
early childhood (MAEE) with simultaneous split-screen video recording and 
polygraph. Sixteen were falling attacks and 20 were either less severe attacks 
exhibiting only deep head nodding or seizures equivalent to drop attacks in 
terms of ictal pattern but recorded in the supine position. All seizures except 
those that occurred in patients in the supine position showed sudden momentary 
head dropping or collapse of the whole body downward. Recovery to the preictal 
position was observed in 0.3-1 s. As a result of carefully repeated 
observations, the 36 seizures were classified as myoclonic flexor type in 9, 
myoclonic atonic type in 2, and atonic type, with and without transient 
preceding symptoms in the remaining 25. The MF seizure was characterized by 
sudden forward flexion of the head and trunk as well as both arms, which caused 
the patient to fall. In the myoclonic atonic seizure, patients showed brief 
myoclonic flexor spasms, immediately followed by atonic falling. The AT seizure 
showed abrupt atonic falling, with and without transient preceding facial 
expression change and/or twitching of extremities. The ictal EEGs of all 36 
seizures exhibited generalized bilaterally synchronous single or multiple 
spike(s) and wave discharges. Atonic drop attacks appear to be a common cause of 
ictal epileptic falling in MAEE."
1445915,"The effects of different DNA sequences on the photoreaction of various 
furocoumarin derivatives was investigated from a quantitative point of view 
using a number of self-complementary oligonucleotides. These contained 5'-TA and 
5'-AT residues, having various flanking sequences. The furocoumarins included 
classical bifunctional derivatives, such as 8-methoxy- and 5-methoxypsoralen, as 
well as monofunctional compounds, such as angelicin and benzopsoralen. Taking 
into an account the thermodynamic constant for noncovalent binding of each 
psoralen to each DNA sequence, the rate constants for the photobinding process 
to each fragment were evaluated. The extent of photoreaction is greatly affected 
by the DNA sequence examined. While sequences of the type 5'-(GTAC)n are quite 
reactive towards all furocoumarins, 5'-TATA exhibited a reduced rate of 
photobinding using monofunctional psoralens. In addition terminal 5'-TA groups 
were the least reactive with 5- and 8-methoxypsoralen, but not with angelicin or 
benzopsoralen. Also 5'-AT-containing fragments exhibited remarkably variable 
responses toward monofunctional or bifunctional psoralen derivatives. As a 
general trend the photoreactivity rate of the former is less sequence-sensitive, 
the ratio between maximum and minimum being less than 2 for the examined 
fragments. The same ratio is about 3.4 for 8-methoxypsoralen and 6.2 for 
5-methoxypsoralen. This approach, in combination with footprinting studies, 
appears to be quite useful for a quantitative investigation of the process of 
covalent binding of psoralens to specific sites in DNA."
1448101,"Potential DNA replication accessory factors from the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae have previously been identified by their ability to bind to DNA 
polymerase alpha protein affinity matrices (J. Miles and T. Formosa, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 89:1276-1280, 1992). We have now used genetic methods to 
characterize the gene encoding one of these DNA polymerase alpha-binding 
proteins (POB1) to determine whether it plays a role in DNA replication in vivo. 
We find that yeast cells lacking POB1 are viable but display a constellation of 
phenotypes indicating defective DNA metabolism. Populations of cells lacking 
POB1 accumulate abnormally high numbers of enlarged large-budded cells with a 
single nucleus at the neck of the bud. The average DNA content in a population 
of cells lacking POB1 is shifted toward the G2 value. These two phenotypes 
indicate that while the bulk of DNA replication is completed without POB1, 
mitosis is delayed. Deleting POB1 also causes elevated levels of both chromosome 
loss and genetic recombination, enhances the temperature sensitivity of cells 
with mutant DNA polymerase alpha genes, causes increased sensitivity to UV 
radiation in cells lacking a functional RAD9 checkpoint gene, and causes an 
increased probability of death in cells carrying a mutation in the MEC1 
checkpoint gene. The sequence of the POB1 gene indicates that it is identical to 
the CTF4 (CHL15) gene identified previously in screens for mutations that 
diminish the fidelity of chromosome transmission. These phenotypes are 
consistent with defective DNA metabolism in cells lacking POB1 and strongly 
suggest that this DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein plays a role in 
accurately duplicating the genome in vivo."
1448671,"The clinical and electrophysiological data of 18 consecutive adult patients with 
paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LMES) have been reviewed. The 
cancer associated with LEMS was small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in 15 cases and 
epidermoid lung carcinoma in 3 cases. The main clinical neurological features 
were proximal lower limb weakness (100%), depressed tendon reflexes (94%) and 
dryness of the mouth (66%). The results of repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) 
were not statistically different in the paraneoplastic LEMS group and in a group 
of 6 LMS patients in whom no carcinoma had been detected. Low-amplitude compound 
muscle action potential (CMAP) was present in all cases; decremental response at 
low stimulation rates was present in 13/15 cases. An abnormal incremental 
response at high stimulation rates was observed in all cases. A close 
correlation between CMAP amplitude and clinical condition was found in 4 cases 
during the long-term follow-up. In one patient the RNS electrical pattern could 
be misinterpreted as myasthenia gravis in only one muscle tested. We underline 
the usefulness of a 50 Hz stimulation during 4 seconds to establish the 
diagnosis unequivocally, and that of post-exercise facilitation in routine 
detection among an SCLC population. Our results suggest that CAMP amplitude and 
RNS test could be used to evaluate the short-term improvement of LMS under 
treatment and, in some cases, for the long-term follow-up. The infraclinical 
axonal neuropathy detected in 8 patients probably was another associated 
autoimmune paraneoplastic complication."
1449438,"Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) is usually a variant of normal occurring in about 4% 
of the population. Complications are relatively uncommon, but false associations 
due to ascertainment bias have had a potential for iatrogenic harm. Adverse 
outcomes which do occur in a subset of MVP subjects are considered here in 
relation to the contributions of genes, gender and geometry. There are definite 
associations between MVP and several dominantly inherited connective tissue 
abnormalities; it occurs in 85% of adults with Marfan syndrome. All these 
contribute to a very small proportion of the MVP population. A larger less 
easily characterised group with dominant inheritance and some features of a 
connective tissue disorder awaits DNA studies for identification. For most MVP 
subjects our data define significant family aggregation consistent with 
polygenic inheritance; the likelihood of a first degree relative having MVP is 
about two and a half times the population average. There is a higher prevalence 
in young women than in men-5% versus 3%; this has also been demonstrated for 
floppy mitral valve (MV) at autopsy. MVP complications of chordal rupture, 
severe mitral regurgitation and infective endocarditis are, however, two to 
three times more common in men, are age related and evident after the age of 50 
years. Higher blood pressure in men may contribute to this in accordance with a 
response-to-injury hypothesis to explain progressive valve changes. Leaflet, 
annulus and left ventricular size differences and septal changes are geometric 
variants with a potential for increasing tension-related valve injury.(ABSTRACT 
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1449769,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) presents with sudden onset of visual 
loss mainly in young adult males. LHON is not uncommon in Australia, accounting 
for 2% of invalid blind pensions. We have identified 20 unrelated families 
carrying mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with LHON and 135 of 291 
individuals with documented LHON are currently alive in Australia. The mean age 
of onset of visual loss for males was 26 years and for females 27 years, with a 
range from six to 65 years. The mean risk of visual loss was 20% for males and 
4% for females. There are over 1750 male and female carriers living in Australia 
who have not yet lost vision; 600 carriers are under 24 years of age. The 
expected number of new cases of blindness from LHON is three to four per year."
1449838,"The relation between the results of 7 biological markers (cells, total protein, 
albumin, IgG, IgG ratio, Tibbling ratio, and Tourtellotte's formula) and 4 
paraclinical tests (PEV, PEATC, CT and MR) in 236 patients with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) not selected by the localization of symptoms were studied. One 
hundred forty-one had clinically defined MS, 22 had defined MS supported by a 
laboratory and 68 had clinically probable MS. The existence of a relation 
between PEV and MRI abnormality and the increase in the concentration and the 
ratios of intrathecal IgG synthesis and the degree of certainty of disease 
diagnosis was demonstrated. The most sensitive test was MRI (93%) followed by 
VEP (83%) and BAEP (60%) and the sensitivity of the study with high resolution 
CT including 59 patients explored by double enhancement and delayed cut off was 
very low (33%). It was considered that for the lack of a specific diagnostic 
test the use of biological markers PEV and MR constituted a necessary aid in the 
diagnosis of MS."
1450882,"Sudden death in athletes is a rare but tragic occurrence. Congenital 
cardiovascular abnormalities, usually asymptomatic and often undiagnosed during 
life, are the main causes in young athletes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 
congenital coronary anomalies are the most commonly occurring disorders. 
Idiopathic concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (non-physiological), 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and Marfan's syndrome with aortic 
rupture have also been implicated. Rarer causes include mitral valve prolapse 
and myocarditis. Coronary atherosclerosis is the major cause in older, and 
occasionally in younger athletes. Those involved in the medical care of athletes 
should be aware of the potential causes of sudden death in these groups. 
Symptomatic athletes should be fully investigated. Screening programmes are 
probably not justified on a cost effective basis."
1455234,"The amount of the heterotrimeric G protein subunit G alpha i2 decreases after 
the induction of F9 teratocarcinoma cells to become primitive endoderm in the 
presence of retinoic acid (RA). The reduction of the G alpha i2 protein in F9 
cells by antisense RNA expression was associated with (i) loss of 
receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; (ii) decreased cell doubling 
time; (iii) induction of a primitive, endoderm-like phenotype in the absence of 
RA; and (iv) production of the differentiation marker tissue-type plasminogen 
activator. Expression of a constitutively active, mutant G alpha i2 blocked 
RA-induced differentiation. These data suggest the involvement of G alpha i2 in 
the control of stem cell differentiation and provide insight into the 
involvement of G proteins in growth regulation."
1456297,"We report on a boy with short stature, mental retardation, seizures, follicular 
ichthyosis, generalized alopecia, hypohydrosis, enamel dysplasia, photophobia, 
congenital aganglionic megacolon, inguinal hernia, vertebral, renal and other 
anomalies, and a normal chromosome constitution. The clinical findings include 
all the features that dermotrichic and ichthyosis 
follicularis-alopecia-photophobia (IFAP) syndrome have in common and in addition 
those that characterize IFAP syndrome (photophobia, recurrent respiratory 
infections, etc.), those that are present only in dermotrichic syndrome (nail 
anomalies, hypohydrosis, megacolon, vertebral defects, etc.) and additional ones 
(enamel dysplasia, renal anomalies, inguinal hernia, etc.). Two maternal uncles 
were referred as being affected by alopecia and ichthyosis suggesting X-linked 
recessive transmission. Various hypotheses concerning the relationship between 
the 2 syndromes and the present case are discussed."
1459383,"A total of 110 women who had reported urinary incontinence to their general 
practitioners were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Treatment 
consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and 
bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. The results were measured 
after 3 and 12 months by a research assistant on the basis of a constructed 
severity scale, an incontinence diary, and a comparison by the patients 
themselves of their previous and current conditions. After 3 months the control 
group were given the same treatment. After a further 3 and 12 months, they were 
assessed in exactly the same way as the treatment group. After 3 months about 
60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent; the mean number 
of wet episodes had gone down from 20 to 7, and 74% of the women felt improved 
or cured. These results were later corroborated by the control group. After 12 
months this successful outcome was improved slightly further. It may be 
concluded that the majority of women with incontinence can be successfully 
treated by the general practitioner. The effect of this treatment continues 
after one year."
1464550,"For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is 
a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of ""arachnodactyly"". 
Marfan-Syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder with high 
penetrance and variable expressivity. In our opinion this case of a 41-year-old 
patient with kidney cysts and aneurysma dissecans of the arteria ascendens by 
Marfan-Syndrome was described in the literature only twice. The casuistics of 
this Marfan-Syndrome patient shows a particular rare associated 
organ-change--the kidney cysts--and illustrate the frequency of this hereditary 
disease."
1465304,"An external fixator has been designed that is rigid enough to eliminate the need 
for skeletal traction in patients with unstable pelvic-ring fractures. This 
Wichita frame is similar to the Pittsburgh frame but is stiffened by the use of 
locked crossbars connecting the side triangles. The frame was tested in 
cadaveric specimens by techniques previously reported. In addition, 
finite-element modeling of the various frame designs was performed to ensure 
that the frame configuration was optimal and to supplement in vitro test 
results. Multiple variables that can influence frame failure loads were 
examined."
1467651,"We have identified a mutant of pea cultivar Alaska that has many of the 
characteristics normally associated with light-grown seedlings even when grown 
in complete darkness. We have designated this mutant lip1, for light independent 
photomorphogenesis. Etiolated wild-type pea seedlings are white to slightly 
yellow in color and have a distinct morphology characterized by elongated 
epicotyls and buds containing unexpanded leaves with small, undifferentiated 
cells. In contrast, mutant seedlings grown under the same conditions are yellow 
in color and have short epicotyls and expanded leaves showing clear cellular 
differentiation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed partially developed, 
agranal plastids in the dark-grown mutant, unlike wild-type seedlings that 
contain etioplasts with prolamellar bodies. The mutant also exhibits a much 
shorter lag period for chlorophyll accumulation when etiolated seedlings are 
transferred from darkness to white light. The dark-grown mutant has 10-fold less 
spectrally detectable phytochrome, which can be attributed to a 10-fold 
reduction in the level of the PHYA polypeptide. Cab, Fed1, and RbcS transcripts 
are present in dark-grown mutant seedlings at levels comparable to those 
produced in light-grown material. The levels of these transcripts show a normal 
decrease when green plants grown for 15 days in a light/dark cycle are 
transferred to continuous darkness. However, transcript levels remain high 
during dark treatment of seedlings grown for 9 days in continuous light, 
indicating that the dark adaptation response in this mutant is developmentally 
plastic. The lip1 mutant has several features in common with the deetiolated 
Arabidopsis mutants det1, det2, and cop1. However, there are also several 
important differences, including varying effects on phytochrome levels, 
organ-specific gene expression, plastid development, and response to dark 
adaptation."
1468866,"Two hundred and ninety cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) 
registered in England and Wales from 1970 to 1989 were followed at 6-monthly 
intervals. Male to female ratio was 2.8:1. Age at onset increased significantly 
over the period. Measles was recorded for 81% of cases; in nearly half this had 
occurred under 2 years. Measles vaccine was documented in 20 cases; in 10 
measles was also documented and it could not be positively excluded in the 
remainder. The calculated risk of SSPE following measles was 4.0/100,000 cases 
compared with the risk after vaccine of 0.14/100,000 doses. Measles under 1 year 
carried a risk 16 times greater than measles over 5 years. There was an excess 
of cases in third and subsequent children. The incidence was higher in the 
northwest than in the southeast of the country. Survival time varied from 4 
weeks to 16 years and was shorter when measles had occurred over the mean age of 
2.5 years. Of the cases 9% had a history of mental retardation before the onset 
of SSPE. The incidence of SSPE has fallen following the reduction in measles 
resulting from vaccination. However, because of the median 8-year interval 
between measles and onset of SSPE, further cases arising from measles during the 
study period must still be expected, particularly in adolescents."
1469425,"We have studied effects of TRH analogue, TA-0910 
(3-methyl-(s)-5,6-dihydroorotyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide) (from Tanabe, Osaka, 
Japan) on explanted ventral and dorsal spinal cord cultures from 13- and 
14-day-old rat embryos. TA-0910-treated cultures had significantly increased 
neurite outgrowth with cultures of ventral spinal cord, but not with cultures of 
dorsal spinal cord. The effect was dose-dependent. A possible role for TRH in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains to be defined."
1470196,"Plasma and IgG obtained from 10 Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES) patients 
(5 with carcinoma, 5 without associated cancer), 6 healthy subjects, and 1 
patient with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were examined in their ability to 
recognize chromaffin cell antigens on Western blots. The pattern of antigen 
recognition was compared with the magnitude of inhibition of voltage-dependent 
calcium and sodium currents recorded with the patch-clamp technique from 
chromaffin cells. Eight of the 11 patients with LES and/or SCLC recognized 
plasma membrane proteins and 9 of the patients' IgG interacted with cytoplasmic 
antigens with no apparent pattern of antigen recognition between patients. Also, 
there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with LES from those 
with LES and concurrent SCLC. Eighty percent of the LES patients' antibodies 
were capable of reducing the calcium current (ICa) in chromaffin cells. One of 
the novel findings of this study is that 30% of the patients had produced 
antibodies which were able to inhibit both calcium and sodium currents (INa). 
The heterogeneous response of the IgG on the Western blots does not appear to 
correlate with the efficacy of reducing the inward currents."
1470299,"Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015 (10 
microM), to Krebs'-Ringer phosphate (KRP) superfusion medium, significantly 
increased the release of dopamine in vitro from superfused corpus striatum 
tissue fragments of male rats. A dose-dependent increase in release of dopamine 
was obtained in response to increasing concentrations of NSD-1015, with 1.0 
microM being the minimally effective dose. In addition to the striatum, NSD-1015 
also increased the release of dopamine from superfused hypothalamic tissue 
fragments. This capacity of NSD-1015 to increase release of dopamine was 
calcium-independent, appeared to be somewhat specific and could apparently 
increase the release of dopamine in vivo, as indicated by increases in the 
release of the metabolite of dopamine, DOPAC, under conditions of push-pull 
perfusion. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid 
decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a 
result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent 
activator of the release of dopamine."
1470965,"Drug and alcohol abuse continue to be commonly encountered problems in most 
patient populations. To deal effectively with these problems, the primary care 
physician must have a thorough knowledge of the pharmacology of commonly abused 
drugs and the adjunctive agents used in treatment. Management of alcoholism may 
involve a range of medical interventions, including the treatment of alcohol 
intoxication, the use of benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal, and possibly 
the short-term administration of disulfiram to maintain sobriety. Successful 
management of cocaine or amphetamine abuse requires an understanding of the 
powerful reinforcing properties of these drugs and the unique problems that 
arise in the recovery period. Barbiturate intoxication and withdrawal are 
potentially life-threatening events requiring skilled in-patient treatment. 
Prolonged use of benzodiazepines can lead to drug dependence; successful 
withdrawal involves gradual dosage reduction. Acute intoxication from marijuana 
or hallucinogenic drugs may occasionally result in adverse reactions requiring 
medical intervention, but significant withdrawal reactions are rare. Management 
of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and 
skillful use of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the 
prompt and skillful use of opioid antagonists. Promising new pharmacologic 
approaches are now being successfully applied to the management of opioid 
dependence. An acceptance of nicotine as the addictive component of tobacco 
smoke has led to the development of nicotine gum as substitution therapy for 
cigarette smoking. Successful pharmacologic management of overdose or withdrawal 
is often the prerequisite for effective long-term treatment and recovery."
1471661,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to categorize the histologic findings in the liver 
in patients with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low 
platelet count) and to correlate these findings with the severity of clinical 
laboratory abnormalities.
STUDY DESIGN: Eleven patients with laboratory criteria for HELLP syndrome who 
required cesarean delivery underwent needle biopsy of the liver under direct 
visualization.
RESULTS: Eight patients had periportal hemorrhage, and six had fibrin 
deposition. Fatty infiltration was seen in four, one with large-droplet fat, 
three with microvesicular fat. There was no statistically significant 
correlation between the severity of the histologic findings of periportal 
hemorrhage and fibrin deposition and the clinical laboratory findings. Fatty 
infiltration did not correlate with the severity of the HELLP syndrome's 
histologic condition, but, in contrast, did correlate with thrombocytopenia and 
aminotransferase elevations.
CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory abnormalities do not accurately reflect the severity of 
the underlying histopathologic condition in HELLP syndrome. We propose that all 
patients with HELLP syndrome, regardless of the degree of their laboratory 
abnormalities, be treated aggressively, primarily with delivery."
1473624,"Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. 
Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and 
its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as 
signalling molecules in the embryo. Although its exact mechanism of action is 
unknown, it has been suggested that it causes its characteristic pattern of 
defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest 
cells. However, other effects on cells are known. We studied early cardiac cell 
proliferation using incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and detection with 
a monoclonal anti-BrdU. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures 
was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level 
in myocardium. We studied its effects in culture on precardiac explant 
development in the absence of the neural crests. Culture of precardiac 
mesodermal-endodermal explants revealed that development of heart vesicles from 
the mesoderm was little affected, but the development of heartbeat was inhibited 
depending on dose in the 10(-5) to 10(-7) M range. The effect on development of 
contractions was augmented in the presence of serum; it could be duplicated by 
all-trans-retinoic acid, and it was reversible. Synthesis of the alpha-actin 
isotype, analyzed by isoelectric focusing, was found to be inhibited or delayed. 
The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and 
differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the 
potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis."
1474300,"Over the past two decades, anxiety disorders have become the focus of much 
research after years of relative obscurity. The accumulating data has suggested 
that anxiety disorders may have many consequences including decreased quality of 
life, economic dependence, multiple somatic complaints, maladaptive personality 
traits, and increased mortality due to suicide, cardiovascular, and 
cerebrovascular causes. Aggressive management of these disorders may greatly 
lessen the impact."
1474844,"Several species of Plasmodium have been shown to contain a circular 
extrachromosomal DNA molecule which is widely supposed to be mitochondrial DNA. 
However, it has recently been shown to have a number of features in common with 
chloroplast DNA. Here, a phylogenetic analysis of RNA polymerase coding 
sequences from the Plasmodium molecule has been carried out using distance 
matrix, maximum likelihood, parsimony and operator invariant methods. The 
analysis indicates that the molecule is in fact derived from an oxygenic 
photosynthetic organism and should be regarded as plastid DNA. This suggests 
that Plasmodium originated from a phototroph that has lost the capacity to 
photosynthesize."
1475128,"Pelvic girdle injuries leading to anterior and posterior disruption are rarely 
seen in children. External fixation is useful to reduce and stabilize the pelvis 
in order to control massive blood loss due to severe venous bleeding. The 
anterior tension band element of the external fixator can successfully maintain 
reduction of the pelvic girdle. Dislocation or fracture dislocation of the 
sacroiliacal joint cannot be reduced with simple traction techniques. Leg length 
discrepancy is to be expected when the hemipelvis is displaced. Seven cases of 
this rare injury in children are presented together with the late outcome. 
Treatment modalities are discussed."
1475854,"It has been shown elsewhere that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in A431 cells 
can recycle in receptor-bound state (Teslenko et al., 1987; Sorkin et al., 1989, 
1991). Present study deals with the action of primaquine, a lysosomotropic 
agent, on EGF-receptor complexes (EGF-RC). By the method of indirect 
immunofluorescence with anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody it is found that 
following a 1 h incubation of cells at 37 degrees C in the presence of EGF a 
bright staining of endosomes appears in the intranuclear region, while after 
incubation of the cells at 4 degrees only margins of cells are stained. Such a 
pattern of fluorescence is peculiar of endocytosis in A431 cells. When the cells 
were incubated in the presence of a 0.3 mM primaquine for 1 h, the 
immunostaining is changed: bright compact spot in the para-Golgi region 
appeared. The effect of primaquine is reversible. When the cells after 
preincubation with EGF were incubated in the absence of EGF for 3 h at 37 
degrees C, the staining of cell margins could be observed again, demonstrating 
the recycling of EGF-RC. Under similar conditions of cell incubation, but in the 
presence of primaquine, the staining of the para-Golgi region was not changed. 
In the experiments with 125I-EGF it was shown that intracellular accumulations 
of 125I-EGF were maintained when the cells were incubated in the presence of 0.3 
mM primaquine. It is concluded that primaquine inhibits the recycling of EGF-R 
in A431 cells."
1478653,"The human dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene is localized to chromosome 5p15.3 by 
in situ hybridization and PCR amplification of rodent somatic cell hybrid DNA. 
Analysis of a 40-bp repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the message revealed 
variable numbers of the repeat ranging from 3 to 11 copies. These results will 
aid in the investigation of a role for this gene in genetic disorders of the 
dopaminergic system in humans."
1478673,"We characterized 21 t(13;14) and 3 t(14;21) Robertsonian translocations for the 
presence of DNA derived from the short arms of the translocated acrocentric 
chromosomes and identified their centromeres. Nineteen of these 24 translocation 
carriers were unrelated. Using centromeric alpha-repeat DNA as 
chromosome-specific probe, we found by in situ hybridization that all 24 
translocation chromosomes were dicentric. The chromatin between the two 
centomeres did not stain with silver, and no hybridization signal was detected 
with probes for rDNA or beta-satellite DNA that flank the distal and proximal 
ends of the rDNA region on the short arm of the acrocentrics. By contrast, all 
24 translocation chromosomes gave a distinct hybridization signal when satellite 
III DNA was used as probe. This result strongly suggests that the chromosomal 
rearrangements leading to Robertsonian translocations occur preferentially in 
satellite III DNA. We hypothesize that guanine-rich satellite III repeats may 
promote chromosomal recombination by formation of tetraplex structures. The 
findings localize satellite III DNA to the short arm of the acrocentric 
chromosomes distal to centromeric alpha-repeat DNA and proximal to 
beta-satellite DNA."
1479601,"The existence of locus heterogeneity for a genetic disease may complicate 
linkage studies considerably, especially when very few large families with the 
disease are available. In this situation a modest collection of families is 
unlikely to be sufficient for successful localisation of one or more disease 
genes. Recently, eight research groups working on tuberous sclerosis (TSC) 
brought together linkage data pertaining to the candidate chromosomes 9, 11, and 
12 for a large group of families. In a series of simulation studies we 
determined the probability of detecting linkage and linkage heterogeneity in 
this set of families. On average TSC families are very small; in most cases 
there are fewer than two informative meioses. The size distribution of 
chromosome 9 linked families was similar to that of non-linked families. This 
indicates that a dramatic difference in the clinical severity of major genetic 
forms of TSC is unlikely. The results of our simulation studies show that this 
set of families can generate highly significant evidence for linkage and 
heterogeneity. When two TSC genes are equally common, the strongest evidence for 
linkage and heterogeneity could be obtained using a method based on the 
incorporation of multiple candidate regions in a single analysis, with an 
average lod score of 24.27."
1480136,"Microsomes prepared from COS-1 cells transiently expressing rabbit cytochromes 
P450 2C1 and 2C2 catalyzed the metabolism of arachidonic acid to predominantly 
11,12- and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) when microsomal epoxide 
hydrolase activity was inhibited by 0.2 mM 1,2-epoxy-3,3,3-trichloropropane. 
P450 2C2 catalyzed the formation of 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET at a ratio of 3.0 
and also produced 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE). The 11,12-EET, 
14,15-EET, and 19-HETE represented 48.3, 15.9, and 12.8%, respectively, of the 
total metabolites formed. P450 2C1 produced a similar but distinct ratio of 
11,12-EET to 14,15-EET (2.0) and did not produce any detectable 19-HETE. The 
11,12-EET and 14,15-EET represented 63.0 and 31.1%, respectively, of the total 
metabolites formed. The 8,9- and 5,6-EETs were not detected with either enzyme. 
The ratio of the 11,12-EET to 14,15-EET was 1.5 with P450 2CAA, a P450 
arachidonic acid epoxygenase (P450 2CAA) that had an amino-terminal sequence 
identical to that of P450 2C2 [J. Biol. Chem. 267:5552-5559 (1992)]. P450 2C1, 
2C2, and 2CAA metabolized lauric acid. The ratio of omega-1- to 
omega-hydroxylated laurate was 3.6, 3.4, and 2.4 for P450 2CAA, P450 2C2, and 
P450 2C1, respectively. Purified P450 2CAA had a slightly greater apparent 
molecular weight than expressed P450 2C2 on sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The results clearly establish that rabbit P450 2C1 
and 2C2 are arachidonic acid epoxygenases, and they suggest that P450 2CAA and 
2C2 are very similar but may not be identical isoforms."
1480396,"BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well 
described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated 
with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare.
METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in 
ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic 
testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed.
RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order 
neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order 
neuron involvement.
CONCLUSION: Acquired heterochromia can occur in adults. The partial response to 
hydroxyamphetamine in the two cases presented may reflect trans-synaptic 
degeneration of the postganglionic neuron. A reduction in trophic influences on 
iris melanocytes may have contributed to the observed heterochromia."
1481520,"A follow-up (1985, 1990, 1991) study revealed in female workers of hydroponic 
hothouses an increase of the incidence of nervous system diseases depending on 
the length of work (vegeto-vascular dystonia, angiodystonic syndromes, 
vegeto-sensory polyneuropathy). It is suggested that the main cause of nervous 
lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides."
1481858,"We report the occurrence of Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) in a 
karyotypically normal girl who was one of identical twins. Molecular studies 
showed nonrandom X-inactivation in both her fibroblasts and lymphocytes, while 
her normal twin showed equal usage of both X chromosomes. In view of previous 
reports of 7 pairs of identical female twins in which one had Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy, it seems that twinning may be strongly associated with nonrandom 
X-inactivation, and is not specific to the properties of the disease causing 
gene."
1482192,"Nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis 6F3 is used as a food preservative and is 
the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing 
lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. 
Götz, H. Zähner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). 
Nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisA, encodes a 
prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active 
lantibiotic (C. Kaletta and K.-D. Entian, J. Bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). 
Adjacent to nisA, the additional genes nisB, nisT, and nisC were identified. 
Over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently 
identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin 
from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis 
Tü 3298. Genes nisB, nisT, and nisC corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 
600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. The nisT open reading frame is 
homologous to proteins of the HlyB (hemolysin B protein of Escherichia coli) 
subfamily. Proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a 
variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and 
anti-drug tumors, indicating that NisT may be involved in nisin transport. 
Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisA 
structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisA gene was 
determined by primer extension. Additionally, a mRNA of at least 3 kb was 
identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisB. Antibodies were 
raised against the NisB protein, and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed 
a molecular weight of about 115 kDa, which is in accordance with the theoretical 
protein size of 117.5 kDa as calculated from the nisB open reading frame. 
Several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that NisB is 
associated with the membrane. This was confirmed by preparing L. lactis 
vesicles. The NisB protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and 
was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. These results suggest 
that NisB is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell 
membrane."
1483694,"Five independent mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 
(HPRT) gene were identified in a partially HPRT deficient patient with gout and 
in four Lesch-Nyhan patients. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
technique coupled with direct sequencing, the nucleotide sequences of the entire 
HPRT coding region amplified from the cDNA and also of each exon amplified form 
the genomic DNA were analyzed. Three independent point mutations in the coding 
region were detected in the partially HPRT deficient patient (Case 1) and in two 
Lesch-Nyhan patients (Case 2 and 3), resulting in single amino acid 
substitutions. The family study of Case 3, utilizing a PvuII restriction site 
created in the mutant gene, indicated that the mother was a heterozygote, and a 
sister and a fetal brother had inherited the normal HPRT gene from the mother. 
In two other mutants causing Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a portion of the HPRT gene 
was deleted, and RNA splicing was missing in both mutants. A 4-bp deletion at 
the 5' end of exon 4 resulted in formation of three different types of abnormal 
mRNA (Case 4). The other mutant (Case 5) produced abnormal mRNA including 26 bp 
of intron 8 instead of the deleted 58 bp at the 5' end of exon 9, because of a 
74-bp deletion from intron 8 to exon 9."
1484716,"Subcutaneous injection of dilute formalin induces pain in humans and behaviors 
indicative of pain in animals. The formalin test, which is based on these 
observations, is now widely used as a model of pain produced by tissue injury, 
but the neural mechanisms of pain and analgesia in this test have not been 
identified. Rats with transections of the brain rostral or caudal to the pons 
show behavioral reactions to formalin similar to those of normal rats, although 
the temporary abatement of pain 10-15 min after formalin is absent in transected 
animals. Doses of morphine that suppress the behavioral response to formalin in 
normal rats are not antinociceptive in the formalin test in decerebrate rats 
although sedation, catalepsy and inhibition of the tail-flick reflex still 
occur. These results suggest that the response to formalin is organized in the 
brain stem but the antinociceptive effect of morphine in this test is mediated 
by the diencephalon or forebrain."
1492779,"In this study we analyzed the morphologic and ultrastructural characteristics of 
the psammoma bodies in ten meningiomas of different histologic subtypes, 
characterizing the components of the psammoma body and the elements of the 
tumor, such as the capillaries and degenerative cells that have been classically 
considered as initiators of the formation of these calcareous is structures. The 
discussion considers the diagnostic interest of psammoma bodies in central 
nervous system tumors, as well as its histogenesis. The different points of view 
explaining biological mineralization in other territories of the organism are 
analyzed, as well as the formation of psammoma bodies, comparing the morphologic 
data obtained in this study. It is concluded that the mineralization of the 
psammoma bodies is induced principally by the collagen fibers synthesized by the 
meningocytes and that the form of mineralization is spherical and growth is 
radial, controlled by the tumoral cells."
1493439,"The function of c-myc in physiology is only partially known. Its product has DNA 
binding properties and plays a role in the control of proliferation and 
differentiation. In general, increased c-myc expression leads to proliferation 
and abolishment of differentiation. The involvement of c-myc in mouse 
plasmacytomas and human Burkitt's lymphoma is well known: due to chromosomal 
translocation c-myc comes under the influence of regulatory elements of 
immunoglobulin genes, leading to increased expression of the gene and 
proliferation of the cells. In man, the chromosomal translocations may occur 
within the increased pool of (pre) B-cells due to Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and 
malaria infection with subsequent immunosuppression. Apart from these early 
(primary?) events in lymphomagenesis, c-myc is also often involved in tumour 
progression, probably by a similar mechanism. Different types of c-myc 
involvement are associated with specific types of lymphoma: there are 
differences between endemic, sporadic and ileocecal Burkitt's lymphoma as well 
as between those and primary extranodal large cell lymphoma and large cell 
lymphoma which has progressed. These differences are associated with the 
differentiation of the involved lymphoid cells and may point to the stage of 
differentiation in which the oncogenic event occurred."
1498111,"Fractures of the sacrum and lesions of the intervertebral disks are seldom 
reported in childhood and adolescence. In our report, illustrated by three 
representative cases that we treated during the past six months, we show that 
sacrum fractures, not an easy diagnosis, may be more frequent than currently 
assumed, and that in quite a number of children and adolescents an anterior 
pelvic fracture may in fact be an unrecognized Malgaigne type pelvic fracture 
with a posterior fracture plane cutting through the sacrum. They may be 
accompanied by herniations and/or lacerations of intervertebral disks."
1500078,"The appearance of the ""streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome"" led to a growing 
interest in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group-A-streptococci). 
Since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. 
Contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower 
respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. Erythrogenic toxins and low 
molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, 
IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. 
Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic 
shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet 
fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by 
S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type 
caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. 
Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for 
successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be 
done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. 
Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a 
high incidence of rheumatic fever. Infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae 
(group-B streptococci) are often underestimated though they have a first 
position in septicemia and meningitis of newborns. Taxonomy and nomenclature of 
streptococci are often changing; a list of the presently known species is 
presented in table I."
1501489,"The history to about 1850 of the muscle-relaxant poison curare is discussed, 
especially the developments leading to the botanical identification of the 
plants that yield the alkaloidal active principles: Loganiaceae (Strychnos 
species) and Menispermaceae (Abuta, Chondrodendron, and Curarea species). One of 
the earliest encounters with the poison appears to have been during the 
exploration of the Lake Maracaibo region in Colombia by Alonso Pérez de Tolosa 
in 1548. It is pointed out (yet again) that Sir Walter Ralegh did not bring back 
the poison to Europe in 1595 and that it was Keymis who first came across the 
word ourari when exploring the lower reaches of the Orinoco in 1596. Gumilla, La 
Condamine, Ulloa, Veigl, and others gave much additional information about the 
poison during the 18th century. Scientific studies began in the latter part of 
the century when Schreber listed the botanical identities of four of the plant 
components entering into the curare prepared by the Akawai Indians of Surinam. 
As far as is known, none of these people actually saw curare being made. 
Thereafter, progress was rapid. Humboldt and Bonpland were the first trained 
scientists to witness the preparation of the poison, at the very beginning of 
the 19th century. Subsequent exploration by Martius and Spix, Poeppig, Youd, the 
Schomburgk brothers, De Castelnau and Deville, Spruce, and others, up to the 
middle of the century, extended and deepened botanical and ethnological 
knowledge of curare. Study of its physiology started at about that time with the 
classical experiments of Rudolf von Koelliker and Claude Bernard."

in the normal skin of a black woman is demonstrated by electron microscopy. 
Pathological conditions associated with the differentiation ability of Schwann

origin of Schwann cells and melanocytes in the neural crest."
1505946,"CpG islands are short, dispersed regions of unmethylated DNA with a high 
frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. We have analyzed 375 
genes and 58 pseudogenes from the human entries in the EMBL Database for the 
presence of CpG islands. All 240 islands identified are associated with genes, 
and almost all cover at least a part of one exon; i.e., they are useful 
landmarks in the genome for identifying genes. More than half of the genes 
analyzed were associated with islands. All housekeeping and widely expressed 
genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the 
genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. 
In this latter group of genes, the position of the islands was not biased toward 
the 5' end of the transcription unit."
1508523,"Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in one or several 
oral structures. Multiple causal factors have been proposed, and reports on 
their relative importance are conflicting. Lack of diagnostic criteria, 
differences in sampling procedures, incomplete workups, and lack of controlled 
studies make the reliable interpretation of the importance of proposed causal 
factors and the efficacy of specific treatment modalities difficult. This 
article summarizes the available data, critically analyzes their scientific 
merit, and proposes a protocol for clinical management."
1511475,"In a randomized, single-blind and controlled trial, the effects of the 
administration of fruits and vegetables (mean 582 vs. 188 g/day) for 12 weeks 
were compared as adjuncts to a prudent diet in the management of 202 group A and 
204 group B patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fruits and 
vegetables decreased total serum cholesterol level (26.4 vs. 13.8 mg/dl, p less 
than 0.01) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (20.0 vs. 9.8 mg/dl, p less than 
0.01), triglycerides (20.6 vs. 10.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) and fasting blood 
glucose (22.4 vs. 12.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) levels more significant in the 
intervention group than changes in the control group. Adherence to dietary 
advice was assessed by questionnaires. Total adherence score in group A was 
significantly higher than in group B. Group A patients also had a significantly 
smaller rise in lactate dehydrogenase cardiac enzyme which indicates that the 
protective effects of such a diet may be observed within 1 week. There was a 
significantly greater decrease in mean blood pressure in group A than changes in 
group B. These data suggest that fruits and vegetables, because of their high 
soluble dietary fibre and possibly high antioxidant contents, may be a useful 
and safe adjunct to a prudent diet in the treatment of patients with AMI. The 
use of fruits and vegetables may be preferred over oat bran, psyllium and guar 
gum because of their high content of vitamins and minerals."
1518820,"The testis-determining gene Sry is located on the short arm of the mouse Y 
chromosome in a region known to have undergone duplications and rearrangements 
in comparison with the equivalent portion of the human Y chromosome. Detailed 
analysis of the Sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse 
Sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the 
center of a large inverted repeat. This repeat, which is found in both Mus 
musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus Y chromosomes, is not present at 
the human SRY locus. Recombination involving the repeat region may have led to 
an 11-kilobase deletion, precisely excising Sry in a line of XY female mice."
1519448,"This paper reviews studies on the synthesis and secretion of the thyroid 
hormone-binding protein, transthyretin by the choroid plexus. The secretion of 
transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an 
important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain. 
The transthyretin gene is expressed in the choroid plexus of most vertebrates 
and synthesis of this protein may have evolved in the brain before the liver."
1520330,"The E. coli ogt O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase has two cysteine residues 
positioned identically with respect to cysteines in the E. coli ada 
O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. In order to assess their function, these 
residues were each substituted by a glycine to generate altered forms of the ogt 
protein. Mutagenesis of cysteine-139, located within a 'PCHRV' region of 
homology, eliminated functional activity confirming that this residue is the 
methyl-accepting cysteine in the active site of the protein. Substitution of 
cysteine 102 within the sequence 'LRTIPCG' had little effect on the ogt protein 
activity demonstrating that this cysteine is not directly involved with the 
transfer of O6-methylguanine adducts."
1520683,"The patient aged 75 years presents since her youth, in the left eye, ocular 
melanosis with abnormal pigmentation of the sclerotic, hyperpigmentation of the 
iris and abnormal pigmentation of the fundus oculi. Six months ago, she noticed 
that she is not able to see with this eye, and the fundus oculi examination 
emphasizes a malignant choroidal melanoma, with a fixed detachment of the 
retina. The authors show that the denomination Bourquin's benign ocular 
melanosis, under which the affection is known, is improper, as 10% of the cases 
of ocular melanosis degenerate into melanosarcomas. The term melanosis oculi is 
the most adequate one."

sodium taurocholate (0.25%) and oleic acid (0.05%) with a Km of 0.150, 0.04 and 
0.03 mM, respectively for control mouse kidney, human fibroblasts and 
leukocytes. In control samples, the specific activity (nmol/mg prot./h) for 
HMGal is higher than for the natural substrate, galactocerebroside, and is 
severely deficient in the twitcher mouse and in patients with Krabbe disease. 
Comparative investigation of galactocerebrosidase activity in fibroblasts, 
leukocytes and brain with radioactive and fluorogenic substrates reveals a good 
agreement between the results of the two methods. Galactocerebroside (Gal-Cer) 
is a competitive inhibitor of HMGal hydrolysis in mouse kidney homogenates while 
GM1-ganglioside has no inhibitory effect in the same assay system. The 
sensitivity and specificity of this fluorogenic substrate for 
galactocerebrosidase provides a simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of 
Krabbe disease, and for the purification of this enzyme from normal tissues."

1522546,"In ciliates, only one of the alternative forms of the immunodominant membrane 
glycoprotein usually coats the external surface of the cell. Such mutual 
exclusion is regulated at the pretranslational level by mechanisms that result 
in the expression of a single protein gene. In the holotrich Tetrahymena 
thermophila five alternative cell surface immobilization proteins (i-antigens) 
are expressed under different conditions of temperature (L, H, T) and culture 
media (I, S). Using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to these proteins and a 
cDNA probe derived from the SerH3 gene, we have reinvestigated expression of 
i-antigens in media supplemented with 0.2 M NaCl. We find that in addition to S, 
the H and L antigens are also present on the cell surface. While all three 
i-antigens may be simultaneously present on the cell surface, the combinations 
S/L and S/H are more frequent. Compared to cells expressing H and L singly, the 
level of H3 mRNA is diminished, and a subset of the L family of polypeptides is 
variably expressed. The expression of S begins within 30 min after transfer to 
NaCl-supplemented medium, while the expression of L begins three days to several 
weeks after transfer. When cells are transferred out of NaCl-supplemented 
medium, S is turned off within 24 h, and L is expressed for at least 1 wk prior 
to the return of full H expression. Although these differences in kinetics 
suggest differences in control mechanism(s), the absence of I and T on the 
surface of NaCl-grown cells suggests that there is also a common regulatory link 
among H, S and L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1524841,"The chromosome in situ hybridization with human X chromosome alpha satellite DNA 
probe (pBamX7) on human lymphocyte metaphases and interphase nuclei was 
performed for interphase cytogenetic studies. The individuals with numerical or 
structural abnormalities of X chromosome were studied. The results showed that 
the probe hybridized specifically to the centromeric region (p11----q11) of X 
chromosome. The number of silver grain clusters in interphase nuclei was 
correlated with that of X chromosome. Most of the clusters located near the 
nuclear membrane where inactive X chromatins (Barr-bodies) were usually found. 
The method of ascertaining the number of X chromosomes by in situ hybridization 
was much more reliable than that by counting the number of Barr-bodies. The 
modified R-banding technique was introduced and the significance of this work 
was also discussed."
1528004,"It is now clear that molecular defects in human mitochondrial DNA play a 
significant role in human disease. Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from single 
base changes in the 16.5 kilobase-pair genome up to large deletions and 
rearrangements. Independently of the actual cause of a given mutation, it is 
possible to predict at least some of the consequences of changes in 
mitochondrial DNA sequence. This paper reviews our overall understanding of the 
mode and mechanism of mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription and how 
this relates to mitochondrial gene expression. This provides a background to 
anticipate the nature and extent of mitochondrial DNA sequence changes that 
might be of physiological consequence."
1530123,"Fanconi's anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder with a high incidence 
(greater than 90%) of aplastic anemia and a premalignant component with a 
greater than 10% risk of leukemia or solid tumors. The diagnosis of Fanconi's 
anemia depends on increased chromosomal breakage in lymphocytes following 
treatment with a DNA cross-linking agent; patients have been identified who are 
clinically well and whose physical appearance is normal. Although bone marrow or 
cord blood transplants can be curative, treatment for the aplastic anemia 
usually depends on androgens. Close to 20 patients with Fanconi's anemia have 
delivered normal babies, and the mothers' hematologic status was not 
significantly adversely affected by the pregnancy. A few patients have clonal 
cytogenetic abnormalities in their bone marrow that do not necessarily indicate 
leukemic transformation, but further follow-up is important. Studies of in vitro 
erythropoiesis indicate a correlation between the clinical hematologic status 
and the presence of erythroid progenitors in the blood or bone marrow. Certain 
hematopoietic growth factors do increase growth in vitro, suggesting that new 
types of therapy may become available. Not every patient has a poor prognosis. 
There are now many adults with Fanconi's anemia, some with families of their 
own."
1531780,"Doxorubicin is an effective antineoplastic agent, but it frequently causes 
dose-related cardiotoxic effects. Because the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) 
level is elevated in children with heart defects, the authors measured the ANP 
levels in children to determine whether ANP might serve as a simple diagnostic 
indicator of cardiotoxic effects. Sixteen patients, 5 to 19 years of age, who 
were being treated with doxorubicin (45 mg/m2 body surface area) for various 
malignancies had ANP levels measured in plasma. There was a group of six 
children, with a significant peak of plasma ANP (pANP) levels 3 weeks after the 
administration of the drug. Of these six patients, five had received high 
cumulative doses of doxorubicin (160 to 370 mg/m2), and two of them went into 
congestive heart failure without a previous decline in left ventricular ejection 
fraction, a standard technique for monitoring cardiac function during treatment 
with doxorubicin. The other ten patients had normal ANP levels throughout the 
study, and signs of cardiac dysfunction did not develop. None of the patients in 
the control group who had cancer and were not treated with doxorubicin and none 
of the healthy volunteers had elevated ANP levels. These preliminary results 
suggest that pANP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator for 
doxorubicin-related myocardial damage."
1532229,"Recent studies have identified a conserved 28-bp element (HF-1) within the rat 
cardiac MLC-2 gene which confers cardiac muscle-specific and inducible 
expression during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Utilizing a combination of 
independent experimental approaches, this study characterizes two cardiac 
nuclear factors which bind to HF-1, a ubiquitous factor (HF-1a), and an A + 
T-rich binding factor (HF-1b) which is preferentially expressed in 
differentiated cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The HF-1a binding site is 
located in a core region of the 28-bp conserved element, immediately upstream 
from the A + T-rich HF-1b site, which is homologous to the MEF-2 site found in a 
number of muscle genes. By a number of separate criteria (gel mobility shift, 
competition, and mutagenesis studies), HF-1b and MEF-2 appear to be 
indistinguishable and thus are either identical or closely related muscle 
factors. Transient assays of luciferase reporter genes containing point 
mutations throughout the 28-bp HF-1 regulatory element document the importance 
of both the HF-1a and HF-1b sites in transient assays in ventricular muscle 
cells. In the native 250-bp MLC-2 promoter fragment, mutations in the single E 
box had little effect on cardiac muscle specificity, while point mutations in 
either the HF-1a or HF-1b binding site significantly reduced promoter activity, 
underscoring the importance of both the HF-1a and HF-1b sites in the 
transcriptional activation of this cardiac muscle gene. Thus, this study 
provides evidence that a novel, ubiquitous factor (HF-1a) and a muscle factor 
(HF-1b/MEF-2) can form a novel, E-box-independent pathway for muscle-specific 
expression in ventricular cardiac muscle cells."
1533274,"Mature T cells express either CD4 or CD8 on their surface. Most helper T cells 
express CD4, which binds to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
proteins, and most cytotoxic T cells express CD8, which binds to class I MHC 
proteins. In the thymus, mature CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing alpha 
beta T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) develop from immature thymocytes through 
CD4+CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ intermediates. Experiments using mice transgenic for 
alpha beta TCR suggest that the specificity of the TCR determines the CD4/CD8 
phenotype of mature T cells. These results, however, do not indicate how a T 
cell differentiates into the CD4 or CD8 lineage. Here we show that the CD4 
transmembrane region and/or cytoplasmic tail mediates the delivery of a specific 
signal that directs differentiation of T cells to a CD4 lineage. We generated 
transgenic mice expressing a hybrid molecule composed of the CD8 alpha 
extracellular domains linked to the CD4 transmembrane region and cytoplasmic 
tail. We predicted that this hybrid molecule would bind to class I MHC proteins 
through the extracellular domains but deliver the intracellular signals 
characteristic of CD4. By crossing our transgenic mice with mice expressing a 
transgenic alpha beta TCR specific for a particular antigen plus class I MHC 
protein, we were able to express the hybrid molecule in developing thymocytes 
expressing the class I MHC-restricted TCR. Our results show that the signal 
transduced by the hybrid molecule results in the differentiation of immature 
thymocytes expressing a class I-restricted TCR into mature T cells expressing 
CD4."
1574115,"Fanconi's anaemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
progressive pancytopaenia and a cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking 
agents. Four genetic complementation groups have been identified so far, and 
here we use a functional complementation method to clone complementary DNAs that 
correct the defect of group C cells. The cDNAs encode alternatively processed 
transcripts of a new gene, designated FACC, which is mutated in group C 
patients. The predicted FACC polypeptide does not contain any motifs common to 
other proteins and so represents a new gene involved in the cellular response to 
DNA damage."
1579228,"Evidence that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has prominent trophic effects 
on the motor system led to several negative therapeutic trials in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, a disease of the motor system. Since TRH crosses the 
blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all, we postulated that the negative 
parenteral clinical trials could be a result of insufficient drug-receptor 
interaction. We thus carried out a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study 
of intrathecal TRH in 36 patients by delivery through an implanted, constant 
infusion pump achieving a steady-state CSF level comparable with that shown to 
be effective in tissue culture experiments. Utilizing a quantitative measurement 
technique to assess motor unit loss, we did not observe any alteration of the 
progressive course during 6 months on TRH and 6 months on saline placebo. 
However, the implanted pump delivery system proved to be safe, reliable, and 
well tolerated."
1580196,"Calcification of chronic subdural haematoma is called ""armoured brain"" when it 
covers most of the cortical surface. We report high-field magnetic resonance 
images of the armoured brain, and discuss the relationship between operative 
findings, computer assisted tomographic (CT) findings and the change in 
relaxation time on magnetic resonance images. In our case, low, iso, and high 
density layers were detected on computer assisted tomography. The change in 
relaxation time of a liquefied haematoma showed good agreement with 
chronological change in intracerebral haematoma, and the material was easily 
detected on magnetic resonance images. But with a grainy and mud-like haematoma, 
the change in relaxation time did not coincide with the state of the 
intracerebral haematoma. It is generally said that in the detection of a 
calcified mass, computer assisted tomography is superior to magnetic resonance 
images and this was also true in the present case. While there are a few reports 
on computer assisted tomographic findings for the armoured brain, this is 
probably the first report on high-field (1.5T) magnetic resonance imaging of the 
armoured brain."
1580595,"Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) encompasses a heterogeneous 
group of conditions characterized by reduced responses of target tissues to 
thyroid hormone due to defects at the site of hormone action. In the majority of 
patients, GRTH is inherited as a dominant trait associated with mutations in the 
hormone-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor. GRTH serves as a 
prototype of other resistance syndromes for hormones that act via nuclear 
receptors."
1582406,"Titin is at present the largest known protein (M(r) 3000 kDa) and its expression 
is restricted to vertebrate striated muscle. Single molecules span from M- to 
Z-lines and therefore over 1 micron. We have isolated cDNAs encoding five 
distant titin A-band epitopes, extended their sequences and determined 30 kb 
(1000 kDa) of the primary structure of titin. Sequences near the M-line encode a 
kinase domain and are closely related to the C-terminus of twitchin from 
Caenorhabditis elegans. This suggests that the function of this region in the 
titin/twitchin family is conserved throughout the animal kingdom. All other 
A-band sequences consist of 100 amino acid (aa) repeats predicting 
immunoglobulin-C2 and fibronectin type III globular domains. These domains are 
arranged into highly ordered 11 domain super-repeat patterns likely to match the 
myosin helix repeat in the thick filament. Expressed titin fragments bind to the 
LMM part of myosin and C-protein. Binding strength increases with the number of 
domains involved, indicating a cumulative effect of multiple binding sites for 
myosin along the titin molecule. We conclude that A-band titin is likely to be 
involved in the ordered assembly of the vertebrate thick filament."
1584813,"The properties of the methyl-directed DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase (EC 
2.1.1.37) suggest that it is the enzyme that maintains patterns of methylation 
in the human genome. Proposals for the enzyme's mechanism of action suggest that 
5-methyldeoxycytidine is produced from deoxycytidine via a dihydrocytosine 
intermediate. We have used an oligodeoxynucleotide containing 
5-fluorodeoxycytidine as a suicide substrate to capture the enzyme and the 
dihydrocytosine intermediate. Gel retardation experiments demonstrate the 
formation of the expected covalent complex between duplex DNA containing 
5-fluorodeoxycytidine and the human enzyme. Formation of the complex was 
dependent upon the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting 
that it comprises an enzyme-linked 5-substituted dihydrocytosine moiety in DNA. 
Dihydrocytosine derivatives are extremely labile toward hydrolytic deamination 
in aqueous solution. Because C-to-T transition mutations are especially 
prevalent at CG sites in human DNA, we have used high-performance liquid 
chromatography to search for thymidine that might be generated by hydrolysis 
during the methyl transfer reaction. Despite the potential for deamination 
inherent in the formation of the intermediate, the methyltransferase did not 
produce detectable amounts of thymidine. The data suggest that the ability of 
the human methyltransferase to preserve genetic information when copying a 
methylation pattern (i.e., its fidelity) is comparable to the ability of a 
mammalian DNA polymerase to preserve genetic information when copying a DNA 
sequence. Thus the high frequency of C-to-T transitions at CG sites in human DNA 
does not appear to be due to the normal enzymatic maintenance of methylation 
patterns."
1587867,"Circular duplex DNA containing the SV40 replication origin was assembled into 
chromosomes in vitro with core histones and nucleosome assembly factor from HeLa 
cells. Their ability to serve as a template for replication was examined by 
incubating them with SV40 T antigen and HeLa cell extract. Nucleosome assembly 
of the template prevented DNA replication. Replication of chromosomes was 
severely inhibited at more than two-thirds of physiological nucleosome density. 
When the DNA was preincubated with T antigen and then assembled into 
chromosomes, however, inhibition of DNA replication was greatly reduced. These 
results suggest that nucleosome assembly of the template inhibits initiation of 
SV40 DNA replication and that the inhibition can be overcome by formation of an 
initiation complex before nucleosome assembly."
1588015,"A sister and brother, now aged 7 and 9 years, presented with developmental 
arrest, gait disturbance, dementia, and a progressive myoclonic epilepsy 
syndrome with hyperacusis in the second year of life. Then, spastic 
quadriparesis led to a decerebrate state. In the absence of macular or retinal 
degeneration, organomegaly, and somatic-facial features suggesting 
mucopolysaccharidosis, the presence of hyperacusis together with sea-blue 
histiocytes in bone marrow biopsies and deficient beta-galactosidase activity 
but normal glucosidase, hexosaminidase, and neuraminidase activity on lysosomal 
enzyme assays constitutes the clinical-pathologic-biochemical profile of GM1 
gangliosidosis type 2. This is a rare, late infantile onset, progressive 
gray-matter disease in which beta-galactosidase deficiency is largely localized 
to the brain, though it can be demonstrated in leukocytes and cultured skin 
fibroblasts. It must be distinguished from the Jansky-Bielschowsky presentation 
of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic 
acidosis, strokelike episodes (MELAS) and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red 
fibers (MERRF) syndromes, atypical presentations of GM2 gangliosidoses 
(Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff's diseases), primary sialidosis (neuraminidase 
deficiency), galactosialidosis, and Alpers' disease."
1590260,"Progeria is a rare genetic disease with striking features that resemble 
accelerated aging. The inheritance pattern, paternal age effect, and lack of 
consanguinity argue that it is due to a sporadic dominant mutation. We have 
observed elevated levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) excretion in progeria patients. 
In several progeria patients we observed normal levels of growth hormone (GH) 
but very low levels of insulin-like growth factor I along with very high basal 
metabolic rates (BMRs). A trial of GH treatment was begun, which resulted in a 
marked increase in linear growth and a paradoxical drop in BMRs in these two 
patients. We hypothesize that the failure of patients with progeria to thrive 
may be due to a bioinactive form of GH and a lack of vasculogenesis caused by 
excess HA. An understanding of the progeria genetic mutation may define a key 
gene with a major effect on normal aging."
1595355,"Centrally administered thyrotropin-releasing hormone exerts a well documented 
hypertensive effect. In this study, the possible physiological role of 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the central cardiovascular regulation was 
evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats receiving long-term (8-14 days) 
intracerebroventricular infusion of a heterologous antiserum to 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone. The effect of this passive immunization on the 
blood pressure was monitored from conscious animals by the tail-cuff method. 
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone antiserum significantly decreased the systolic 
arterial pressure in adult rats with established hypertension. No alterations in 
serum thyroid hormone status were observed indicating that the antihypertensive 
effect of immunological blockade of thyrotropin-releasing hormone was not due to 
changes in the serum thyroid hormone levels. These results provide evidence for 
a role of endogenous brain thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the maintenance of 
hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats."
1596403,"This study presents the experience of one year of treatment in patients with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with intrathecal TRH administered daily by a 
subcutaneous reservoir connected to the intrathecal lumbar space by a double 
catheter system as to provide continuous circulation of CSF and to avoid sac 
formation since this would be a source of infection. Clinical evaluation was 
carried out with a scale developed by the authors with the main aim of 
evaluating the loss of vital motor abilities and not as a localized evaluation. 
Secondary effects due to the implantation of the reservoir in addition to its 
use are presented although data were not important. Intrathecal administration 
of TRH was carried out similarly (600 micrograms/day) with secondary effects 
being the same as those by other routes of administration although of a lesser 
intensity. The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of 
the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial 
effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do 
not improve the natural evolution of the disease. The authors conclude that, 
methodologically, this series study does not enter within the frame of an 
advisable statistical study since the aim is to provide data for a future 
controlled study."
1597367,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is characterized by the triad of facial 
paralysis, facial oedema, and lingua plicata in association with other symptoms, 
such as headache and mental changes. Because the origin of this syndrome is 
still unknown, only symptomatic treatment is possible. In 18 patients suffering 
from MRS, whether with a complete or with an incomplete picture, we used the 
antileprosy drug clofazimine for therapy. A decrease in the frequency and 
intensity of oedema was achieved by this therapy in 94% of patients. However, 
improvement persisting throughout a follow-up period of up to 3 years was seen 
in only 62% of patients. We demonstrate that clofazimine is an alternative to 
glucocorticosteroids for the treatment of MRS."
1598200,"2'-Deoxyoligonucleotides with 5-fluorocytosine residues incorporated at specific 
positions of the nucleotide sequence are tools of great potential in the study 
of the catalytic mechanism by which DNA cytosine methyltransferases methylate 
the 5-position of DNA cytosine residues in specific sequence contexts. Chemical 
synthesis of such oligonucleotides is described. Two alternative approaches have 
been developed, one of which proceeds via a fully protected phosphoramidite of 
5-fluoro-4-methylmercapto-2'-deoxyuridine 2, the other via a fully protected 
phosphoramidite of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine 3. Either building block can be 
used in automated oligonucleotide synthesis applying standard elongation cycles 
and deprotection procedures exclusively. The methylmercapto function of 2 is 
replaced by an amino group in the final ammonia treatment used for cleavage from 
support and base deprotection."
1599520,"OBJECTIVE: To standardize outcome measures in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). Three indices were identified which could adequately describe outcome 
(disease activity, damage from disease, and health status); we describe here the 
development of the Disease Activity Index.
METHODS: Twenty-four variables were identified as important factors in a disease 
activity index. These were used to generate 574 patient profiles, which were 
rated on a disease activity scale of 0-10 by 14 rheumatologists. A second rating 
of 10 of the profiles yielded scores that were not significantly different from 
the first, indicating that experienced clinicians can reliably make global 
estimates of disease activity. Multiple regression models were used to estimate 
the relative importance of the 24 clinical variables in the physicians' global 
rating of disease activity. These were estimated on a ""training set"" of 75% of 
physicians' ratings, and then validated on a ""testing set,"" consisting of the 
remaining 25% of physicians' ratings.
RESULTS: The explanatory power of the models in the training set was high (R2 = 
0.93). The models' regression coefficients for the organ systems were simplified 
for easier use in clinical practice. This generated a ""weighted"" index of 9 
organ systems for disease activity in SLE, the SLEDAI, as follows: 8 for central 
nervous system and vascular, 4 for renal and musculoskeletal, 2 for serosal, 
dermal, immunologic, and 1 for constitutional and hematologic. The maximum 
theoretical score is 105, but in practice, few patients have scores greater than 
45. The SLEDAI predicted well the physicians' ratings in the testing set 
(Pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.64-0.79).
CONCLUSION: The SLEDAI is a validated model of experienced clinicians' global 
assessments of disease activity in lupus. It represents the consensus of a group 
of experts in the field of lupus research."
1605172,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by the pentad of 
fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fluctuating 
neurologic symptoms, and renal dysfunction. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
has recently been reported in association with rheumatic diseases (RDs). The 
authors present a patient with TTP and polymyositis and speculate on the 
pathophysiology linking these two conditions. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura and RDs may present with overlapping clinical and laboratory features. 
It is important to identify TTP as a cause of thrombocytopenia and hemolysis 
when occurring in patients with RDs since management, treatment, and prognosis 
differ. Early recognition and prompt institution of plasmapheresis may improve 
the outcome in patients with TTP."
1605898,"The sedative thalidomide was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago because of 
its teratogenic and neurotoxic adverse effects. The compound was later 
discovered to be extremely effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum 
leprosum, a complication of lepromatous leprosy. This effect is probably due to 
a direct influence on the immune system, because thalidomide possesses no 
antibacterial activity. The compound is presently used as an experimental drug 
in the treatment of a variety of diseases with an autoimmune character, 
including recurrent aphthosis of nonviral and nonfungal origin in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. This article reviews the most important 
chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of thalidomide. The possible mechanisms 
of the nonsedative effects of thalidomide with respect to the safety of its use 
in HIV patients are discussed. Because the mechanism of the immunomodulatory 
effect of thalidomide is unknown, the possibility that the administration of 
this compound will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of 
HIV patients cannot be excluded. Clinical evidence suggests that thalidomide may 
aggravate the condition of patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to thalidomide may occur more frequently in HIV 
patients than in other patient groups. Because of the teratogenic activity of 
thalidomide, reliable contraception must be provided to female patients of 
childbearing age. Before the introduction of thalidomide therapy to an HIV 
patient presenting with oral ulcers, a fungal or viral origin of the lesions 
should be excluded. Thalidomide should not be used in patients with preexisting 
HIV-related peripheral polyneuropathy, polyradiculopathy or encephalopathy. In 
patients experiencing a complete remission, the discontinuation of thalidomide 
treatment and its reintroduction in the case of a relapse are preferable to 
maintenance therapy."
1606717,"A female infant presented at birth with hypotonia, growth retardation, 
distinctive facies, multiple congenital anomalies, and a high-pitched mewing cry 
characteristic of cri du chat syndrome. Chromosome studies from both peripheral 
blood and fibroblasts showed a 46,XX,5p- karyotype. Parental chromosome studies 
revealed that the mother carried an apparently balanced pericentric inversion of 
one chromosome no. 5, 46,XX,inv(5)(p14q35). Meiotic crossing-over in the mother 
within the inverted segment of chromosome 5 gave rise to the unbalanced 
karyotype, 46,XX,rec(5)dup q, inv(5)(p14q35)mat in the infant. A small terminal 
segment of the long arm of chromosome 5 (q35-pter) is duplicated with a deletion 
of the short arm of chromosome 5 (p14-pter), accounting for the features of cri 
du chat syndrome. Fewer than 1 in 200 of cri du chat syndrome cases are due to 
recombination aneusomy arising from a parental inversion of chromosome 5. Some 
of these cases, however, do not have typical cri du chat syndrome, reflecting 
significant duplication of 5q material. These cases are reviewed with the 
present case, and recombination behaviour leading to chromosome imbalance is 
discussed."
1608349,"Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a known predisposition for 
lymphoma development. Eight of 120 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome 
followed at the University of Ioannina over the past 7 years developed 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed according to the Kiel classification. The 
lymphomas differed by location and grading. Six were called low grade 
(immunocytoma) and two intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Five of the 
immunocytomas involved the minor salivary or lacrimal glands. Immunoperoxidase 
staining for light chains revealed monoclonal populations. Two patients showed 
spontaneous regression not previously reported in Sjogren's syndrome. Thus, in 
Sjogren's syndrome, low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and especially 
immunocytomas are the most common lymphomas. These lymphomas tend to evolve very 
slowly and may regress spontaneously. Given these facts, a conservative approach 
to treatment is indicated in those patients with only localized disease."
1608955,"The genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) 
map to 15q11-13. Using microdissection, we have recently isolated several DNA 
probes for the critical region. Here we report that microclone MN7 detects 
multiple loci in 15q11-13 and 16p11.2. Eight yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 
clones, two genomic phage clones, and two placenta cDNA clones were isolated to 
analyze these loci in detail. Two of the YAC clones map to 16p. Six YAC clones 
and two genomic phage clones contain a total of four or five different MN7 
copies, which are spread over a large distance within 15q11-13. One cDNA clone 
is from chromosome 15 and one is from chromosome 16. The chromosome 15 cDNA 
detects transcripts of 14 and 8 kilobases in various human tissues. The presence 
of multiple copies of the MN7 gene family in proximal 15q may conceivably be 
related to the instability of this region and thus to the etiology of associated 
disorders."
1611701,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and 
myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased 
plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits 
following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility 
disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv). TRH had 
no effect on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min post-treatment in 
rabbits pre-treated with the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 hr 
before TRH treatment, iv), but the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine did 
not affect these responses to TRH. Experiments in vitro show that although TRH 
(10(-3) to 10(-8) M) had no direct effects on the isolated heart, left atrium, 
and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and 
dopamine on the left atrium. These results suggest that the antishock effects of 
TRH are related to adrenergic systems, perhaps acting on the sympathomedullary 
system to secrete epinephrine and sensitize the beta receptors, but not alpha 
receptors. Thus, TRH improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and 
hemodynamics during hemorrhagic shock. The sensitization of the beta adrenergic 
and dopamine receptors may play an important role in the direct peripheral 
cardiovascular mechanism of TRH effects."

1617622,"The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium (DuP 785, NSC 368390, 
6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline- carboxylic acid 
sodium salt) was shown previously to be an inhibitor of dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. 
Brequinar sodium inhibits the activity of this enzyme isolated from mammalian 
sources only but not those forms isolated from yeast or bacteria, which also use 
ubiquinone as the cofactor. Brequinar sodium also does not inhibit the activity 
of a soluble Zymobacterium oroticum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase which uses NAD+ 
as a cofactor. Brequinar sodium inhibits L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase with 
mixed inhibition kinetics with respect to either the substrate (dihydroorotate) 
or the cofactor (ubiquinone Q6) with Ki' values in the 5-8 nM range. Our results 
suggest that brequinar sodium inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by binding 
to the enzyme at a unique site that is distinct from the dihydroorotate or the 
ubiquinone-binding site. This binding site appears to be unique to the mammalian 
enzyme, because brequinar sodium does not inhibit the yeast, Escherichia coli, 
or Z. oroticum forms of the enzyme."
1618284,"Acute and late onset movement disorders frequently complicate the treatment of 
psychosis with typical neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol, but not with atypical 
neuroleptic drugs like clozapine. Although the neural mechanisms underlying 
neuroleptic-induced movement disorders remain unknown, alterations in basal 
ganglia function are likely involved. A potential role for the endogenous opiate 
peptides in neuroleptic-induced movement disorders is suggested by the 
immunocytochemical localization of met5-enkephalin (ME) in the striatopallidal 
projection pathway, and by the increased levels of ME measured by 
radioimmunoassay in the rat caudate-putamen nuclei (CPN) following haloperidol 
treatment. We sought to determine whether met5-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity 
(MELI) in terminal fields within globus pallidus and in perikarya in CPN was 
differentially altered in rats chronically treated with haloperidol or 
clozapine. Acrolein-fixed forebrain sections were collected from cohorts of 
adult rats receiving 21-day oral administration of haloperidol, clozapine, or 
water. Sections from the three treatment groups were collectively processed for 
immunocytochemical labeling using varying dilutions of ME antiserum and the 
avidin-biotin peroxidase method. In globus pallidus, densitometry measures 
revealed significantly increased levels of immunoperoxidase labeling for ME in 
haloperidol-treated, but not in clozapine-treated animals. In CPN, optical 
densitometry as well as cell counting measurements also showed a significant 
increase in MELI only in the haloperidol-treated group. These results support 
the concept that alterations in endogenous opiate peptides in basal ganglia may 
contribute to movement disorders seen in patients receiving typical neuroleptic 
drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1619500,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have shown that albuminuria 
is a predictor of cardiovascular disease in these patients and there is a 
particularly high incidence of coronary heart disease in the early stages of 
albuminuria.
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE: A number of established cardiovascular risk factors, such as 
elevated blood pressure, atherogenic changes in the plasma concentrations of 
lipids and lipoproteins, elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and, probably, 
hyper-reactivity of platelets are present in patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
Further, albuminuria may be a marker of generalized disease in the vascular wall 
of small and large blood vessels. Findings of an elevated rate of transcapillary 
albumin escape, an elevated plasma concentration of von Willebrand's factor and 
impaired fibrinolytic capacity in early diabetic nephropathy support this 
hypothesis.
CONCLUSION: The initial pathophysiological mechanisms involved in diabetic 
nephropathy are still hypothetical and largely unknown."

manner. Clinical applications of pupillography and pharmacological examination 
to Horner syndrome, Adie syndrome, diabetes mellitus, pupillary involvement of

been described. Segmental spasm of iris in Horner and Aide syndrome, especially, 
nasal side of iridoplegia was seen in early stage of Aide syndrome from 
pupillary dynamics to light stimulus. An involvement of sympathetic nerve 
subserving iris dilator muscle was confirmed from pupillography, drug reaction 
to topically applied l-epinephrine in the diabetics. An involvement of

1628536,"Evidence strongly suggests that many adverse drug reactions, including 
idiosyncratic drug reactions, involve reactive metabolites. Furthermore, certain 
functional groups, which are readily oxidized to reactive metabolites, are 
associated with a high incidence of adverse reactions. Most drugs can probably 
form reactive metabolites, but a simple comparison of covalent binding in vitro 
is unlikely to provide an accurate indication of the relative risk of a drug 
causing an idiosyncratic reaction because it does not provide an indication of 
how efficiently the metabolite is detoxified in vivo. In addition, the incidence 
and nature of adverse reactions associated with a given drug is probably 
determined in large measure by the location of reactive metabolite formation, as 
well as the chemical reactivity of the reactive metabolite. Such factors will 
determine which macromolecules the metabolites will bind to, and it is known 
that covalent binding to some proteins, such as those in the leukocyte membrane, 
is much more likely to lead to an immune-mediated reaction or other type of 
toxicity. Some reactive metabolites, such as acyl glucuronides, circulate freely 
and could lead to adverse reactions in almost any organ; however, most reactive 
metabolites have a short biological half-life, and although small amounts may 
escape the organ where they are formed, these metabolites are unlikely to reach 
sufficient concentrations to cause toxicity in other organs. Many idiosyncratic 
drug reactions involve leukocytes, especially agranulocytosis and drug-induced 
lupus. We and others have demonstrated that drugs can be metabolized by 
activated neutrophils and monocytes to reactive metabolites. The major reaction 
appears to be reaction with leukocyte-generated hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous 
acid is quite reactive, and therefore it is likely that many other drugs will be 
found that are metabolized by activated leukocytes. Some neutrophil precursors 
contain myeloperoxidase and the NADPH oxidase system, and it is likely that 
these cells can also oxidize drugs. Therefore, although there is no direct 
evidence, it is reasonable to speculate that reactive metabolites generated by 
activated leukocytes, or neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow, could be 
responsible for drug-induced agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. This could 
involve direct toxicity or an immune-mediated reaction. These mechanisms are not 
mutually exclusive, and it may be that both mechanisms contribute to the 
toxicity, even in the same patient. In the case of drug-induced lupus, a 
prevalent hypothesis for lupus involves modification of class II MHC 
antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

1634521,"The antiparallel side-to-side association of spectrin alpha and beta monomers is 
a two-step process which occurs in seconds even at 0 degrees C and at low 
concentrations. Assembly involves initial contact of complementary nucleation 
sites on each subunit, which are located near the actin binding end of the long, 
flexible heterodimer rod. The minimum nucleation sites are comprised of 
approximately four contiguous 106-residue homologous segments or repeats. Three 
repeats in the nucleation site contain an 8-residue insertion and have the 
highest homology to the four spectrin-like repeats in alpha-actinin. The 
adjacent actin binding domain on the beta subunit and the adjacent EF hand 
motifs on the alpha subunit are not required for heterodimer assembly. The 
nucleation sites probably have a specific lock and key structure which defines 
the unique side-to-side pairing of the many homologous segments in both 
subunits. Assembly of spectrin heterodimers is probably most analogous to a 
zipper. After initial nucleation site binding, the remainder of the subunits 
quickly associate along their full lengths to reconstitute a normal dimer by 
supercoiling around each other to form a rope-like, flexible rod. Assembly is 
terminated if either polypeptide is interrupted by a protease cleavage. 
Heterozygotic mutations involving either nucleation site are predicted to affect 
allele incorporation into the mature membrane skeleton."
1636917,"Sedative-analgesic treatment of patients on long-term artificial ventilation 
aims at protection from stress related to their disease or therapy. By 
stabilising both the patient's vital functions and psychological state this 
treatment may contribute to therapeutic success. The choice of drugs depends 
primarily on the nature and course of the underlying disease. Midazolam and 
propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the 
post-operative period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 
both agents on cardiovascular function, cortisol production, lipometabolism, and 
the recovery period following 24-h sedation. METHODS. Twenty female patients 
(mean body weight: 72 kg, mean age: 60 years) were randomly assigned to receive 
either midazolam or propofol over 24 h following major abdominal surgery. 
Balanced anaesthesia (halothane/O2/N2O/fentanyl) was administered for the 
surgical procedure. Assisted ventilation was used in all patients during the 
post-operative sedation period. Sedation depth was maintained at III-IV on the 
Ramsey scale. On arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU), an initial i.v. bolus 
of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg or propofol 1 mg/kg was followed by a continuous infusion 
(midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg.h; propofol: 2 mg/kg.h). Supplementary boluses of one-half 
the initial dose were given if required. Post-operative analgesia was achieved 
with 3 mg intravenous piritramide at 2-h intervals. A 7F Swan-Ganz catheter was 
inserted in the pulmonary artery and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters 
were monitored at 4-h intervals over 24 h starting 2 h after arrival in the ICU. 
Catecholamines were measured by high-pressure lipid chromatography (HPLC), 
cortisol by radioimmunoassay, midazolam by HPLC and ultraviolet detection, and 
propofol by HPLC and fluorescence detection. Data were calculated as means. The 
statistical analysis was performed according to the Mann-Whitney test, and 
significance was accepted for P less than 0.05. RESULTS. On administration of 
the propofol bolus at the onset of sedation, a decrease in blood pressure was 
particularly observed in patients with masked hypovolaemia, however, this 
decrease was easily controlled by volume administration. Independent of the type 
of sedation, the haemodynamic parameters remained unchanged throughout the 
observation period. At all times of measurement the mean heart rate was lower in 
the propofol group (90/min) when compared with the midazolam group (100/min), 
however, this difference did not reach significance. There were also no 
significant differences in cardiac index at all times of measurement, although 
it increased in both groups within the first 12 h by 0.6 l/min.min2. In both 
groups this increase was associated with a reduction in peripheral resistance 
and an increase in rectal temperature. To achieve the desired sedation depth, 
midazolam was administered at a mean dosage of 0.11 mg/kg.h and propofol at 1.9 
mg/kg.h. Catecholamine levels decreased in both groups within the first 8 h: 
after 8 h of sedation the plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline were 525 
and 65 pg/ml, respectively, in the midazolam group and 327 and 51 pg/ml in the 
propofol group. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

1641820,"Thirty-two patients with acute, proximal-vein thrombosis were treated with 
heparin and alteplase (0.25 versus 0.5 mg/kg/24 h during 3-7 days) in a 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter, European (ETTT) trial. The treatment 
resulted in a decrease of the venographic Marder's score from 18 (6-25) to 13 
(2-24) units (median, range) in Group I (0.25 mg/kg/24 h, n = 15, median

mg/kg/24 h, n = 16, median decrease 4.0, p = 0.23). Comparison of the sequential 
venograms could be performed in 14 cases of Group I and in 15 cases in Group II. 
A minority of patients showed substantial partial recanalization of the 
initially obstructed veins on the control venogram (one in each treatment group) 
and most of the control venograms showed either thrombus size reductions (5 in 
Group I, 7 in Group II) or no change or even deterioration (8 in Group I, 7 in 
Group II). Major bleedings were observed in 7 patients (7/32, 22%), 5 of them 
occurring in Group II (5/17, 29%). Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that 
the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in 
heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep 
venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis. Further studies are needed to 
define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication."
1642233,"We report the results of studies on the characterization of the mutation 
associated with marked unbalanced expression of the mutant X chromosome in a 
karyotypically normal girl with Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type II). 
Southern analysis of DNA extracted from somatic cell hybrids containing only the 
mutant X chromosome showed deletion of the Xq27.3-q28 loci: DXS297 (VK23AC), 
DXS293 (VK16), FRAXA (pfxa3), DXS296 (VK21A), and the 3' end of the 
iduronatesulfatase (IDS) gene. The flanking loci--DXS52 (St14-1), DXS304 (U6.2), 
and DXS369 (RN1)--were intact. On the basis of these results, we concluded that 
the mutation was a simple deletion extending a maximum of 3-5 cM to the 
centromeric side of the IDS gene. Both Southern analysis of DNA from somatic 
cell hybrids, using short segments of IDS cDNA, and PCR of reverse-transcribed 
RNA from cultured skin fibroblasts indicated that the telomeric terminus of the 
deletion was localized to a region near the middle of the coding sequences of 
the gene."
1646072,"This investigation of a brain cancer cluster in Missouri used two approaches to

cancer with reported exposure to dental X-rays. Occupation was not associated 
with the cluster in the rural town. In a standardized proportional mortality

inconsistently associated with occupation in the literature. Further study of 
brain cancer etiology with respect to dental X-ray exposures seems warranted."

1648656,"We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system 
that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York 
City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the 
deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were 
the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of 
symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although 
long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory 
sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common 
objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were 
encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle 
weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal 
incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and 
disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single 
patient. In 42 (27.4%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 
(23.0%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in 
whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although 
the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin 
concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and 
in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a 
quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 
39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was 
clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the 
hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer 
duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient 
neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, 
with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the 
neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients 
responded, and in 57 (47.1%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms 
or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50% or greater 
after treatment in 91% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe 
neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3%) episodes. The extent of 
neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before 
therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over 
baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of 
symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the 
first 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

1652278,"Vectors derived from herpes simplex virus provide a means of gene delivery to 
postmitotic neurons. The virus is readily taken up at nerve terminals, passes by 
rapid retrograde and anterograde transport within neurons, and is selectively 
transferred across synapses, thus allowing it entry from the periphery into the 
brain. This virus can enter a state of latency in some neurons, where it exists 
as an episomal element in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active to a 
reduced extent. In this state, the virus is apparently benign and can effect 
stable expression of foreign genes. The large (150 kb) genome of this 
double-stranded virus has been completely sequenced. Many of its 70 genes can be 
replaced while still allowing the virus to replicate in at least some cultured 
cells. Some mutations in the viral genome can compromise the toxicity of the 
virus and reduce or eliminate its ability to replicate within neurons. Many uses 
for herpes vectors can be envisioned, including evaluation of neuronal promoter 
elements and functions of neural proteins in culture and in vivo, as well as 
therapeutic delivery of genes to modulate nerve function and for gene 
replacement therapy in vivo."
1655244,"The effect of combinations of the anthracyclines aclarubicin and daunorubicin 
was investigated in a clonogenic assay using the human small cell lung cancer 
cell line OC-NYH and a multidrug-resistant (MDR) murine subline of Ehrlich 
ascites tumor (EHR2/DNR+). It was found that the cytotoxicity of daunorubicin in 
OC-NYH cells was antagonized by simultaneous exposure to nontoxic concentrations 
of aclarubicin. Coordinately, aclarubicin inhibited the formation of 
daunorubicin-induced protein-concealed DNA single-strand breaks and DNA-protein 
cross-links in OC-NYH cells when assayed by the alkaline elution technique. 
Aclarubicin had no influence on the accumulation of daunorubicin in these cells. 
In contrast, the accumulation of daunorubicin in EHR2/DNR+ cells was enhanced by 
more than 300% when the cells were simultaneously incubated with the MDR 
modulator verapamil, aclarubicin, or the two agents combined. Yet the 
cytotoxicity of daunorubicin was potentiated significantly only by verapamil. 
The increased cytotoxicity of daunorubicin in the presence of verapamil was 
completely antagonized when aclarubicin was used together with the MDR 
modulator. Finally, the effect of daunorubicin on the DNA cleavage activity of 
purified topoisomerase II in the presence and absence of aclarubicin was 
examined. It was found that daunorubicin stimulated DNA cleavage by 
topoisomerase II at specific DNA sites. The addition of aclarubicin completely 
inhibited the daunorubicin-induced stimulation of DNA cleavage. Taken together, 
these data indicate that aclarubicin-mediated inhibition of daunorubicin-induced 
cytotoxicity is due mainly to a drug interaction with the nuclear enzyme 
topoisomerase II. This antagonism at the nuclear level explains why aclarubicin 
is a poor modulator of daunorubicin resistance even though aclarubicin is able 
to increase the intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin in a MDR cell line."
1656290,"A 45 year-old male with a butterfly glioma received stereotactic biopsy for 
histologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. Microscopically, the results 
were controversial since some biopsy specimens showed distinct inflammatory

examination revealed a mycotic encephalitis with formation of numerous 
fungi-containing inflammatory foci in all parts of the brain and in the glioma. 
General autopsy disclosed pulmonary aspergillosis as the source of the

1656541,"The Edinburgh Lung Cancer Group registered 3070 new patients with lung cancer in

Karnofsky performance categories and fewer patients underwent surgery. The 
stages of disease were similarly distributed in the two groups and the five year

non-smokers is uncommon and the diagnosis should therefore always be questioned."
1657218,"The ability of glucocorticoids to induce apoptosis or programmed cell death in 
mouse thymocytes is well-established. Measurement of apoptosis-associated 
internucleosomal DNA fragmentation through determination of the percentage of 
fragmented DNA by electrophoresis or centrifugation of whole cell lysates is by 
far the most common means of quantifying apoptosis. Since these methods measure 
DNA fragmentation in whole cell lysates rather than intact cells, they have 
severe limitations, particularly with heterogeneous cell populations. When mouse 
thymocytes were incubated with glucocorticoids, fixed, stained with propidium 
iodide and analysed flow cytometrically for cell cycle distribution, a distinct 
subpopulation of cells was observed to form below the G0/G1 region, denoted as 
the A0 region. The presence of cells in this region was consistent with the 
presence of internucleosomal DNA fragments as determined by gel electrophoresis. 
Inhibitors of transcription, translation and endonuclease activity, and a 
glucocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented accumulation of cells in this 
region. Irradiation of mouse thymocytes also produced a population in the A0 
region. Cells in this region are believed to have undergone 
glucocorticoid-induced DNA fragmentation. This method represents a useful 
alternative to whole cell lysate assays, since apoptosis can be evaluated on an 
individual cell basis."
1657920,"The lysosomotropic amine primaquine has previously been shown to inhibit both 
secretory and recycling processes of cells in culture. We have used a cell-free 
assay that reconstitutes glycoprotein transport through the Golgi apparatus to 
investigate the mechanism of action of primaquine. In this assay, primaquine 
inhibits protein transport at a half-maximal concentration of 50 microM, similar 
to the concentration previously reported to disrupt protein secretion in 
cultured cells. Kinetic analysis of primaquine inhibition indicates that its 
point of action is at an early step in the vesicular transport mechanism. 
Primaquine does not inhibit the fusion of vesicles already attached to their 
target membranes. Primaquine irreversibly inactivates the membranes that form 
transport vesicles (donor), but not the membranes that are the destination of 
those vesicles (acceptor). Morphological data indicate that primaquine inhibits 
the budding of vesicles from the donor membranes. Once formed, the vesicles are 
refractile to primaquine action, and their attachment to and fusion with 
acceptor membranes proceeds unimpeded. In addition to illuminating the mechanism 
of action of primaquine, this study suggests that the selective action of this 
agent will make it a useful tool in the study of the formation of transport 
vesicles."
1658026,"Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have 
different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their 
isoelectric points (pI). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein 
of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral 
structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by 
comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and 
one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured 
viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, 
antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the 
strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody 
complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross 
reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are 
a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are 
often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity 
of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. 
Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows 
untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be 
characterized on the basis of variant proteins."
1662507,"We reported that one of the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives, KN-62, is a 
potent and specific inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 
(CaMKII) (Tokumitsu, H., Chijiwa, T., Hagiwara, M., Mizutani, A., Terasawa, M. 
and Hidaka, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4315-4320). We have now investigated 
the inhibitory property of a newly synthesized methoxybenzenesulfonamide, KN-93, 
on CaMKII activity in situ and in vitro. KN-93 elicited potent inhibitory 
effects on CaMKII phosphorylating activity with an inhibition constant of 0.37 
microM but this compound had no significant effects on the catalytic activity of 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/phospholipid dependent protein kinase, 
myosin light chain kinase and Ca(2+)-phosphodiesterase. KN-93 also inhibited the 
autophosphorylation of both the alpha- and beta-subunits of CaMKII. Kinetic 
analysis indicated that KN-93 inhibits CaMKII, in a competitive fashion against 
calmodulin. To evaluate the regulatory role of CaMKII on catecholamine 
metabolism, we examined the effect of KN-93 on dopamine (DA) levels in PC12h 
cells. The DA levels decreased in the presence of KN-93. Further, the tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) phosphorylation induced by KCl or acetylcholine was 
significantly suppressed by KN-93 in PC12h cells while events induced by 
forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP were not affected. These results suggest that KN-93 
inhibits DA formation by modulating the reaction rate of TH to reduce the 
Ca(2+)-mediated phosphorylation levels of the TH molecule."
1663533,"To evaluate the clinical significance of monoclonal antibody against human 
pulmonary surfactant apoprotein (S-AP), surgically resected lung cancer from 122 
patients was studied. Paraffin embedded tissues were used for the 
immunohistochemical study by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The 
results were as follows. 1. Adenocarcinoma showed highest immunoreactivity for 
S-AP compared to the other histologic types. Among subtypes of adenocarcinoma, 
type II alveolar epithelial type, clara cell type and mixed type of these two 
types were strongly positive (100%, 77.8% and 66.7% respectively). These results 
indicate that this antibody may be a good marker for the subtyping of 
adenocarcinoma. 2. There were some positive cases in other histologic types 
especially in peripheral type of squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest 
that this antibody was useful for the histological differentiation of lung 
cancer. 3. As to the immunohistochemical reactivity there was a good correlation 
between tissue and cytological specimens, which indicate cytological studies may 
be adequate for this kind of histopathological studies. 4. In our study, there 
were no patients with S-AP positive carcinomas other than patients with lung 
cancer. These results indicate that this antibody could be used for the 
differential diagnosis between primary and secondary lung cancer."
1663587,"In order to investigate the physiological importance of the membrane pump in 
eliminating released dopamine (DA) we have studied the effects of the putative 
selective dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, GBR 12909, on synthesis and metabolism 
of monoamines in the rat striatum, limbic forebrain, cortical hemispheres and 
substantia nigra (SN). The effects of the drug on the firing rate of 
catecholamine containing neurons in the SN and locus coeruleus (LC) were also 
investigated. For comparison we have investigated the effects of desipramine and 
maprotiline. As a measure of the synthesis of noradrenaline (NA), DA and 
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) we determined the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) 
and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation after inhibition of aromatic 
L-amino acid decarboxylase by 3-hydroxy-benzylhydrazine (NSD 1015). As indirect 
measurements of DA and NA release in vivo, we have assessed pargyline-induced 
3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and normetanephrine (NM) accumulation and disappearance 
rates of DA and NA after inhibition of their synthesis by 
alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT). Administration of GBR 12909 (2.5, 5, 10, 20 
or 40 mg/kg) decreased the NSD 1015-induced DOPA accumulation in the striatum 
and in the limbic forebrain. In contrast, only minor effects of the drug were 
seen on the DOPA accumulation in the cortical hemisphere and on the cerebral 
5-HTP accumulation. GBR 12909 increased the 3-MT accumulation in the striatum, 
limbic forebrain and the cortical hemispheres, an effect that was even more 
pronounced in haloperidol-pretreated animals. However, GBR 12909 did not alter 
the 3-MT accumulation in the SN either when given alone or when given to 
haloperidol-pretreated rats. In haloperidol-pretreated rats GBR 12909 markedly 
enhanced the DA disappearance in the striatum and in the limbic forebrain, but 
not in the SN. Furthermore, GBR 12909 did not significantly affect the firing 
rate of dopaminergic neurons in the SN or that of noradrenergic neurons in the 
LC. Taken together, our results support the notion that GBR 12909 is a specific 
DA uptake inhibitor without a transmitter releasing action. In addition, our 
findings indicate that DA re-uptake is of physiological importance in the 
elimination of DA from the synaptic cleft in the striatum, limbic forebrain and 
cortical hemispheres, but not in the SN. Furthermore, a large part of the DA 
taken up by the dopaminergic terminals in the striatum and in the limbic 
forebrain seems to be re-incorporated into the storage vesicles."
1704372,"Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences were tested for the potential to regulate 
mammalian cell growth by introducing these sequences into HeLa cells in a 
coupled DEAE-dextran transfection/affinity cell sorting system. Both Alu and 7SL 
RNA genes mediated inhibition of [3H]thymidine and [35S]methionine incorporation 
in recipient cells. In addition, short term growth curves were performed on 
calcium phosphate/DNA cotransfected, affinity-purified cells. This second assay 
revealed that transfected Alu and 7SL RNA can also cause suppression of HeLa 
cell proliferation. To investigate whether transcription or polymerase III (pol 
III) transcription factor binding was required for inhibitory activity, 
mutations were introduced into RNA pol III B block promoter elements in each of 
these genes. Suppression of [3H]thymidine incorporation was dependent on the 
presence of this pol III element in both genes; likewise, 7SL RNA-mediated 
growth suppression required the presence of the pol III B block promoter 
element. The results of this study indicate that Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences 
interact with cellular factors that are important for HeLa cell proliferation 
and suggest that these pol III-transcribed elements may be involved in the 
regulation of cellular growth."
1705835,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a disorder of myelopoiesis characterized 
by severe neutropenia or absence of blood neutrophils secondary to a 
maturational arrest at the level of promyelocytes. We examined peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SCN patients who demonstrated normalization of their 
blood neutrophil counts in a phase II clinical study with recombinant human 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). When stimulated in vitro with 
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), PBMC of those SCN patients produced G-CSF 
activity, as judged by proliferation induction of the murine leukemia cell line, 
NFS-60. Western and Northern blot analysis showed G-CSF protein and G-CSF-mRNA 
indistinguishable in size from those of normal controls. We conclude that PBMC 
of the SCN patients tested are capable of synthesizing and secreting 
biologically active G-CSF in vitro."
1709156,"The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i.e. by 
reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an 
important role in this process. We report enzymatic studies of the secondary 
structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu 
elements. These experiments show that the dimeric organization of an Alu 
sequence is reflected in its RNA folding. Alu subunits fold independently, 
conserving secondary structure motifs of their progenitor 7 SL RNA molecule. 
Energy minimization analysis indicates that this folding pattern is also 
characteristic of different Alu and Alu-like sequences and has been conserved 
since primate divergence. By analogy to 7 SL RNA, the Alu RNA folding may be 
important for specific interactions with proteins. This could indicate a 
physiological function for Alu transcripts. However, this can be also seen as a 
structural adaptation leading to efficient retroposition of these sequence 
elements."
1711838,"Bleomycins are a family of compounds produced by Streptomyces verticillis. They 
have potent tumour killing properties which have given them an important place 
in cancer chemotherapy. They cause little marrow suppression, but pulmonary 
toxicity is a major adverse effect. The mechanisms of cell toxicity are well 
described based on in vitro experiments on DNA. The bleomycin molecule has two 
main structural components: a bithiazole component which partially intercalates 
into the DNA helix, parting the strands, as well as pyrimidine and imidazole 
structures, which bind iron and oxygen forming an activated complex capable of 
releasing damaging oxidants in close proximity to the polynucleotide chains of 
DNA. This may lead to chain scission or structural modifications leading to 
release of free bases or their propenal derivatives. The mechanisms are well 
described based on in vitro experiments on DNA, but how they relate to intact 
cells in whole animals is more tenuous. Bleomycin is able to cause cell damage 
independent from its effect on DNA by induction lipid peroxidation. This may be 
particularly important in the lung and in part account for its ability to cause 
alveolar cell damage and subsequent pulmonary inflammation. The lung injury seen 
following bleomycin comprises an interstitial oedema with an influx of 
inflammatory and immune cells. This may lead to the development of pulmonary 
fibrosis, characterized by enhanced production and deposition of collagen and 
other matrix components. Several polypeptide mediators capable of stimulating 
fibroblasts replication or excessive collagen deposition have been implicated in 
this, but the precise role of these in bleomycin-induced fibrosis is yet to be 
demonstrated. Current therapy for bleomycin-induced lung damage is inadequate, 
with corticosteroids most often used. Given the mechanism of action described 
above, antioxidants and iron chelators might be beneficial. Although, studies to 
date are equivocal and there is insufficient evidence to promote their use 
clinically. Novel drugs are currently being developed and it is hoped these may 
be more useful."
1712333,"Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the 
AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end 
formation. In agreement with previous results, random sequence insertions 
between the AAUAAA and G/U box signals were observed to inhibit poly(A) site 
function. However, sequence insertions of similar size that were predicted to 
form RNA stem-loop structures were found to have little effect on the efficiency 
of polyadenylation and instead induced a 3' shift in the site of polyadenylation 
that was equal to the length of the inserted stem-loop. The in vivo utilization 
of a poly(A) site bearing an internal RNA stem-loop structure was inhibited by 
mutations that destabilized the predicted stem but was restored by compensatory 
mutations. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the appropriate 
spacing of the AAUAAA and G/U box signals is critical for poly(A) site function. 
Sequence insertions that are able to form RNA secondary structures that maintain 
the correct spacing of these two RNA target sequences are well tolerated, 
whereas sequence insertions that disturb this spacing inhibit poly(A) site 
recognition. It is proposed that the effect of sequence insertions on poly(A) 
site function may be sufficiently predictable to allow the development of an 
assay for in vivo RNA secondary structure that uses poly(A) site selection as a 
readout."
1713403,"Electrocardiograms taken from 11 patients in sinus rhythm with ventricular 
ectopic rhythms from two different foci were analyzed to find the number of 
sinus beats, S, between the ectopic rhythms (S values). Three out of 11 patients 
had the S values typical for concealed ectopic rhythms. One of them had 
concealed bigeminy of 2n-1 form that occasionally shifted to 2n form. Following 
the shift, S values of 2n-1 form were always achieved by the occurrence of 
double ventricular ectopic rhythms in succession. Concealed trigeminy of 3n and 
3n-2 form was seen in the other two patients. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms 
had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were 
inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic 
characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism 
for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia."
1714232,"Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found 
in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman 
syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The deleted regions in the two 
syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. 
However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and 
deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. This observation 
has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show 
differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). No 
genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. We show here 
that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 
subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in 
AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. Evidence of beta 3 
gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 
translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. 
The localization of this receptor gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible 
role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both 
of these syndromes."
1717335,"Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses are not the smallest causative agents of 
infectious diseases. Single-stranded RNAs as small as 246 nucleotides exist in 
certain higher plants and cause more than a dozen crop diseases. These RNAs have 
been termed viroids. Despite their extremely limited information content, 
viroids replicate autonomously in susceptible cells--that is, they do not 
require helper functions from simultaneously replicating conventional viruses. 
Viroids are covalently closed circular molecules with a characteristic rodlike 
secondary structure in which short helical regions are interrupted by internal 
and bulge loops. Viroids are not translated; they are replicated by a host 
enzyme (or enzymes) (probably RNA polymerase II) via oligomeric RNA 
intermediates by a rolling circle mechanism. Viroidlike satellite RNAs resemble 
viroids in size and molecular structure, but are found within the capsids of 
specific helper viruses on which they depend for their own replication. These 
RNAs are of great interest to molecular biology for at least two reasons: 1) 
they are the smallest and simplest replicating molecules known, and 2) they may 
represent living fossils of precellular evolution in a hypothetical RNA world."
1720261,"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is characterized by skin blistering due to 
basal keratinocyte fragility. In one family studied, inheritance of EBS is 
linked to the gene encoding keratin 14, and a thymine to cytosine mutation in 
exon 6 of keratin 14 has introduced a proline in the middle of an alpha-helical 
region. In a second family, inheritance of EBS is linked to loci that map near 
the keratin 5 gene. These data indicate that abnormalities of either of the 
components of the keratin intermediate filament heterodipolymer can impair the 
mechanical stability of these epithelial cells."
1721555,"Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive hereditary 
condition that presents with cardiac abnormalities characterized by a prolonged 
Q-T electrocardiographic pattern and congenital severe-to-profound auditory 
deficits. This paper describes the auditory history of twin boys born out of 
consanguinity and diagnosed with this syndrome. Both infants were products of 
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and failed initial ABR screening. 
Diagnostic evaluation demonstrated profound hearing loss and developmental 
delays for each infant. Because sudden death is a consequence, audiologists are 
advised to recognize signs and symptoms associated with this syndrome."
1722259,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the 
Caucasian population, affecting approximately 1 in 2,000 newborns but the actual 
estimate varies with the geographic location. The incidence of CF in 
non-Caucasian populations is low. Intensive efforts using genetic linkage 
information ultimately led to the cloning of the CF gene prior to the 
identification of the gene product or its function. The gene encodes what is 
believed to be a transmembrane protein, which has been named the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The CFTR contains two 
nucleotide-binding folds (NBF) which show homology to numerous transport 
proteins with the greatest homology to the P-glycoproteins that are encoded by 
the multiple drug-resistance loci. A three- base deletion resulting in the loss 
of phenylalanine residue (delta F508) in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene is the 
mutation occurring on the majority of CF chromosomes. The overall frequency of 
delta F508 in the present mutant CF gene pool is about 70%, but the study 
populations are not equally represented: there is marked variation in the 
population of delta F508 among different geographic populations. Recently, 
numerous additional, less common mutations have been found. Some mutations occur 
on 2-5% of the CF chromosomes. Many of these are rare 'private' mutations, 
occurring in individual families of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. By 
contrast over 80% of Western European CF mutations have been identified. The 
highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important 
insights into the structure and function of the protein, but further 
improvements are needed in DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status."
1723310,"Angiogenin is a potent blood-vessel-inducing polypeptide with a molecular weight 
of 14,000 that has a unique ribonucleolytic activity. First isolated from the 
conditioned medium of tumour cells, angiogenin has since been purified from 
normal plasma, which suggested that its propensity to induce neovascularization 
should be strictly controlled. Modulation of that activity might involve 
interaction of angiogenin with cell-surface receptors and extracellular matrix 
of endothelial cells, tight-binding inhibition of both its ribonucleolytic 
activity and cell binding property by ribonuclease inhibitor, as well as the 
overall influence of divalent copper, a modulator of angiogenesis."
1727386,"Accumulation of gadd153 mRNA is strongly stimulated in mammalian cells by 
treatments which arrest growth or damage DNA (A. J. Fornace, Jr. et al., Mol. 
Cell. Biol., 9: 4196-4203, 1989). In previous studies, we demonstrated that the 
increased expression of gadd153 following treatment with several DNA-damaging 
agents was mediated transcriptionally (J. D. Luethy et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265: 
16521-16526, 1990). To better define the specificity of this response, we have 
established a sensitive reporter system in which we have stably integrated a 
chimeric gene containing the gadd153 promoter linked to the coding region of the 
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into the genome of HeLa cells. 
Transcriptional activation from the gadd153 promoter was monitored by 
determining levels of CAT activity in cellular lysates prepared from 
gadd153CAT/HeLa cells treated with a variety of agents. The gadd153 promoter was 
strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic 
agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and 
topoisomerase inhibitors. Of the DNA-damaging agents tested, only X-irradiation 
and bleomycin treatments failed to induce gadd153 promoter activity. Agents 
which inhibit replication and cell division and agents which otherwise result in 
cytotoxicity or growth arrest also had little influence on gadd153 promoter 
activity. Expression of the gadd153CAT chimeric gene in xeroderma pigmentosum 
Group A cells, which are deficient in nucleotide excision DNA repair of 
pyrimidine dimers, was maximally induced at UV doses at least 6-fold lower than 
those required for similar induction in repair-proficient HeLa cells. However, 
the methyl methanesulfonate-induced gadd153 promoter activities were similar in 
both cell lines. Novobiocin pretreatment inhibited both UV- and methyl 
methanesulfonate-induced gadd153CAT expression. Collectively, these data 
indicate that: (a) the gadd153 promoter is activated rapidly and specifically by 
DNA damage; (b) the altered DNA structure is the inducing signal for the 
activation of the signal transduction pathway responsible for enhanced gadd153 
expression; and (c) regulation of gadd153 by growth arrest is distinct from that 
of DNA damage. Thus, the gadd153CAT/HeLa cells are a useful model for examining 
the molecular mechanisms associated with the response to DNA damage and provide 
a reporter system for the screening of potential genotoxic agents."
1728914,"A patient with hypothyroidism who was euthyroid on a fixed-dosage, long-term 
maintenance regimen of levothyroxine sodium developed persistently elevated 
serum thyrotropin levels while receiving an aluminum hydroxide-containing 
antacid. The thyrotropin levels returned to normal shortly after cessation of 
the antacid therapy. These observations indicate that aluminum hydroxide may 
interfere with the bioavailability of thyroxine. The thyroid function of 
patients who are receiving replacement or suppressive thyroxine therapy should 
be monitored following the commencement of concurrent treatment with medications 
containing aluminum hydroxide."
1730728,"Type III hyperlipoproteinemia typically is associated with homozygosity for 
apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158----Cys). Dominant expression of type III 
hyperlipoproteinemia associated with apoE phenotype E3/3 is caused by 
heterozygosity for a human apoE variant, apoE3(Cys112----Arg, Arg142----Cys). 
However, this apoE3 variant was not separable from the normal apoE3 in these 
patients' plasma because the two proteins have identical amino acid composition, 
charge, and molecular weight. Therefore, to determine the functional 
characteristics of this protein, we used recombinant DNA techniques to produce 
this apoE variant in bacteria. We also produced a non-naturally occurring 
variant, apoE(Arg142----Cys), that had only the cysteine substituted at residue 
142. These two apoE variants were purified from cell lysates of the transfected 
Escherichia coli by ultracentrifugal flotation in the presence of phospholipid, 
by gel filtration chromatography, and by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Both 
Cys142 apoE variants bound to lipoprotein receptors on human fibroblasts with 
only about 20% of normal binding activity. Therefore, cysteine at residue 142, 
not arginine at residue 112, is responsible for the decreased receptor binding 
activity of the variants. Cysteamine treatment and removal of the 
carboxyl-terminal domain had little effect on the binding activity, whereas both 
modulate the receptor binding activity of apoE2(Arg158----Cys). The mutation at 
residue 142 decreased the binding activity of apoE to both heparin and the 
monoclonal antibody 1D7 (this antibody inhibits receptor binding of apoE), 
whereas apoE2(Arg158----Cys), which is associated with recessive expression of 
type III hyperlipoproteinemia, binds normally to both. The Arg112, Cys142 
variant predominantes 3:1 over normal apoE3 in the very low density lipoproteins 
of plasma from an affected subject, as assessed by differential reactivity with 
the antibody 1D7. The unique combination of functional properties of the Arg112, 
Cys142 variant provides a possible explanation for its association with dominant 
expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia."
1731087,"We have examined the effects of nucleosome cores on the initiation and 
elongation of RNA transcripts by phage T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. A 
transcription template, pT207-18, was constructed containing tandemly repeated 
207 base-pair (bp) nucleosome positioning sequences from a sea urchin 
(Lytechinus variegatus) 5 S RNA gene inserted between the T7 and SP6 
transcription promoters of pGEM-3Z. Nucleosome cores were reconstituted onto 
supercoiled, closed circular pT207-18 DNA and double label transcription 
experiments were performed to determine the effects of nucleosome cores on the 
initiation and elongation of transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase. Both transcript 
initiation and elongation were inhibited, the extent of the inhibition being 
directly proportional to the number of nucleosome cores reconstituted onto the 
pT207-18 DNA templates. Time course transcription experiments indicated that 
nucleosome cores caused a reduction in the equilibrium length of transcripts and 
not mere retardation of elongation rates. Continuous regularly spaced linear 
arrays of nucleosomes were obtained by digesting reconstituted nucleosomel 
pT207-18 templates with DraI, for which a unique restriction site lies within 
the nucleosome positioning region of the 207 bp 5 S rDNA repeat sequence. After 
in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase an RNA ladder with 207 nucleotide 
spacing was obtained, indicating that transcription can occur through continuous 
arrays of positioned nucleosome cores. It is demonstrated that nucleosome cores 
partially inhibit the elongation of transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase, while 
allowing passage of the transcribing polymerase through each nucleosome core at 
an upper limit efficiency of 85%. Hence, complete transcripts are produced with 
high efficiency from short nucleosomal templates, while the production of 
full-length transcripts from long nucleosomal arrays is relatively inefficient. 
The results indicate that nucleosome cores have significant inhibitory effects 
in vitro not only on transcription initiation but on transcription elongation as 
well, and that special mechanisms may exist to overcome these inhibitory effects 
in vivo."
1731117,"We have used the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique to 
gain insight into the pathogenesis of encephalitis caused by Borna disease virus 
(BDV). RNA specific for BDV was first detected in the olfactory bulb of 
intranasally infected rats at 6 days postinfection (p.i.). At 14 days p.i., high 
levels of BDV RNA were found in all brain regions, and at 26 days p.i., 
BDV-specific RNA was also present in the eye, nasal mucosa, and facial skin. In 
the chronic phase of the disease, BDV RNA was identified in many peripheral 
organs but not in blood. Analysis of brain tissue for the presence of cytokine 
mRNAs revealed that the mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis 
factor alpha, and IL-1 alpha had increased sharply at 14 and 26 days p.i. These 
cytokine mRNAs reached maximum levels at the peak of inflammatory reactions and 
decreased drastically in the chronic phase of the disease. Although IL-2 mRNA 
was also found in normal brain, it was markedly increased in BDV-infected brain 
at 14 days p.i. Expression of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA, which was not 
observed in normal rat brain, was detected at 14 days p.i. and reached a maximum 
level at 38 days p.i. IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression correlated with 
expression of CD4 and CD8 mRNAs, indicating that both CD4+ and CD8+ T 
lymphocytes are induced in the early stages of BDV infection. Since IFN-gamma 
and CD8 mRNA levels were still highly elevated in the chronic phase of Borna 
disease, it is likely that CD8+ T lymphocytes act to reduce inflammation and to 
ameliorate neurological signs during the chronic phase of infection."
1732628,"It has been established that the urothelial mucin layer functions as a bacterial 
anti-adherence factor. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat 
patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of 
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an 
immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to 
determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to 
demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder 
urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours, 
but by 24 hours the mucin layer has been regenerated. Two hours following 
intravesical 3H-labeled Escherichia coli administration, bacterial adherence was 
29-fold greater in mucin deficient than mucin intact rabbits (p = 0.05). By 12 
hours, the difference in adherence was not significant. Two hours following 
intravesical administration of 3H-labeled Bacillus Calmette Guerin, mucosal 
adherence was 21-fold greater in mucin deficient compared to mucin intact 
rabbits (p = 0.002). After mucin removal, Bacillus Calmette Guerin urothelial 
adherence was significantly increased. The significant increase in Bacillus 
Calmette Guerin adherence after mucin removal may be clinically exploitable."
1733098,"Analysis by molecular hybridization of the RNAs transcribed by a cell-free 
fraction from avocado infected with avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBV) demonstrated 
the presence of newly synthesized viroid-specific sequences, most of which were 
of the same polarity as the mature infectious viroid RNA. Treatment of the 
cell-free fraction with DNase reduced the total synthesis of RNA considerably, 
but it did not influence that of the ASBV-specific RNAs, indicating that the 
latter were transcribed on an RNA template. Inhibition studies with 
alpha-amanitin showed that the synthesis of ASBV-specific RNAs was not affected 
by concentrations of 1 and 200 micrograms/ml of the drug, which typically 
inhibit RNA polymerase II and III, respectively, from most animal and plant 
systems. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified 
RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, 
plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids 
studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved. Analysis by 
polycrylamide gel electrophoresis under partially and fully denaturing 
conditions of the ASBV-specific RNAs synthesized in vitro showed that they 
contain unit and longer than unit length viroid strands, probably associated in 
complexes with single- and double-stranded regions. The structural properties of 
these complexes are similar to those of the RNAs accumulating in vivo in 
viroid-infected tissues, which are the postulated replicative intermediates of 
the rolling-circle mechanism proposed for viroid synthesis."
1734714,"McLeod syndrome, characterized by acanthocytosis and the absence of a 
red-blood-cell Kell antigen (Kx), is a multisystem disorder involving a 
late-onset myopathy, splenomegaly, and neurological defects. The locus for this 
syndrome has been mapped, by deletion analysis, to a region between the loci for 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In 
this study, we describe a new marker, 3BH/R 0.3 (DXS 709), isolated by cloning 
the deletion breakpoint of a DMD patient. A long-range restriction map of Xp21, 
encompassing the gene loci for McLeod and CGD, was constructed, and multiple CpG 
islands were found clustered in a 700-kb region. Using the new marker, we have 
limited the McLeod syndrome critical region to 150-380-kb. Within this interval, 
two CpG-rich islands which may represent candidate sites for the McLeod gene 
were identified."
1736462,"""Corkscrew oesophagus"" is characterised on the basis of two case reports and 
attention is drawn to thoracic pain of oesophageal origin. Corkscrew oesophagus 
is a radiological diagnosis and is characterised by twisted segments in the 
distal third of the oesophagus. The condition can sometimes be demonstrated 
endoscopically and it is due to a basic disturbance in the motility of the 
oesophagus. Painful conditions in the oesophagus are most frequently caused by 
gastro-oesophageal reflux or disturbances in motility and the latter is 
frequently complicated by reflux oesophagitis. Pain of oesophageal origin is 
frequently a diagnosis by exclusion and requires exclusion of ischaemic heart 
disease. The initial treatment should be directed to the reflux oesophagitis. 
The diagnosis and information about the origin of the pain and the benign course 
of the condition will calm the majority of the patients and remove their fear of 
a possible fatal heart disease."
1741388,"Strand-symmetric relative abundance functionals for di-, tri-, and 
tetranucleotides are introduced and applied to sequences encompassing a broad 
phylogenetic range to discern tendencies and anomalies in the occurrences of 
these short oligonucleotides within and between genomic sequences. For 
dinucleotides, TA is almost universally under-represented, with the exception of 
vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, and CG is strongly under-represented in 
vertebrates and in mitochondrial genomes. The traditional 
methylation/deamination/mutation hypothesis for the rarity of CG does not 
adequately account for the observed deficiencies in certain sequences, notably 
the mitochondrial genomes, yeast, and Neurospora crassa, which lack the standard 
CpG methylase. Homodinucleotides (AA.TT, CC.GG) and larger homooligonucleotides 
are over-represented in many organisms, perhaps due to polymerase slippage 
events. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, 
human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented 
in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. The CCA.TGG triplet is 
ubiquitously over-represented in human viral and eukaryotic sequences. Among the 
tetranucleotides, several four-base-pair palindromes tend to be 
under-represented in phage sequences, probably as a means of restriction 
avoidance. The tetranucleotide CTAG is observed to be rare in virtually all 
bacterial genomes and some phage genomes. Explanations for these over- and 
under-representations in terms of DNA/RNA structures and regulatory mechanisms 
are considered."
1743414,"Leg movements in the supine position of 49 infants with spastic diplegia (three 
to 11 months corrected age) were examined. Only simultaneous flexion and 
extension of the hips and knees were seen, with exceptional isolated hip 
movements; the simultaneous movements had synergic features. When the knees were 
flexed, the hips were flexed, abducted and externally rotated, and the ankles 
were dorsiflexed. When the knees were extended, the hips were extended, adducted 
and internally rotated and the ankles were plantar-flexed. Hip flexion combined 
with knee extension (leg elevation) and isolated knee movements were not seen in 
diplegic infants, but were seen in all control preterm infants with a good 
prognosis, after five and six months corrected age, respectively. The absence of 
these movements is a useful diagnostic item for spastic diplegia."
1746228,"Exencephaly is said to precede anencephaly resulting from failure of the rostral 
neuropore closure. In order to verify if the exencephaly induced after neural 
tube closure would also lead to anencephaly, exencephaly was induced in rat 
fetuses by maternal administration of a single dose (15 mg/kg) of 
cyclophosphamide on day 12 of gestation and pregnancy was prolonged by uterine 
ligation until postconception (PC) day 24. Fetal death was found to increase 
with prolongation of gestation and no sign of recovery from growth retardation 
was observed. Alizarin red-S-stained skeletal preparations substantiated the 
persistence of skull malformations in the exencephalic fetuses. Histological 
observations of the mesenchyme and the brain indicated degenerative changes that 
were intensifying with time. The ventricular system expanded progressively; the 
ependyma was denuded and neural mass lay free in the ventricle. The choroid 
plexus appeared to be elaborate and extensive. The haemorrhagic capillary 
network around the brain tissue was highly proliferative and appeared to 
penetrate the former from the exterior. Tissue necrosis seemed to progress 
unabated. Cystic spaces appeared beneath the base of the brain and became 
progressively large and it appeared as if the brain was being pushed out of the 
shallow cranial fossae. By PC day 24, most of the brain tissue had degenerated, 
thus giving clearly the appearance of the anencephalic condition."
1747413,"Comparative and competitive analyses of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) 
binding to highly purified rat liver, brain and lung cell plasma membranes were 
carried out. The dependence of hormone binding on the time, temperature and 
concentration was studied. The effects of trypsin and partial delipidation on 
the binding parameters of thyroid hormones were investigated. Two thyroid 
hormone-binding sites were detected in cell plasma membranes of all tissues 
under study. The maximal binding of T4 to rat liver membranes and the maximal 
binding of T3 to rat brain membranes was observed in all experiments, the 
affinity for T3 being higher than that for T4. An important role of both protein 
and lipid components of plasma membranes in the membrane reception of thyroid 
hormones is proposed."
1747932,"The inactivation of human and Escherichia coli O6-alkylguanine-DNA 
alkyltransferase by O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine was compared. When 
HT29 cell extracts or E. coli Ada protein were incubated in the presence of 200 
microM O6-methylguanine for 1 h, alkyltransferase activity was reduced to 44 and 
39% of control levels respectively. However, under the same conditions 
O6-benzylguanine completely depleted alkyltransferase activity in the extract 
from human cells but had virtually no effect on the Ada protein. Incubation of 
the HT29 cell alkyltransferase with O6-benzyl[3H]guanine resulted in a 
time-dependent production of [3H]guanine. No similar production of [3H]guanine 
was observed in the presence of the Ada protein. In CHO cells transfected with 
the bacterial ada gene (CHO-ada) or the human alkyltransferase cDNA (CHO-MGMT), 
treatment with 500 microM O6-methylguanine inhibited both alkyltransferases by 
greater than 85%. In contrast, 2 microM O6-benzylguanine inhibited human 
alkyltransferase expressed in CHO-MGMT cells by greater than 99% though 
concentrations as high as 25 microM for 24 h had no inhibitory effects on the 
bacterial alkyltransferase expressed in CHO-ada cells. This selective inhibition 
was also observed in vivo in transgenic mice expressing ada in the liver where 
O6-benzylguanine caused a decrease of only 40% in total hepatic alkyltransferase 
activity compared to 95% in non-transgenic mice, consistent with inhibition of 
only the mammalian alkyltransferase and maintenance of bacterial 
alkyltransferase activity in these animals. Thus, while O6-methylguanine at high 
concentrations inactivates both bacterial and mammalian alkyltransferases, 
O6-benzylguanine is a substrate only for the mammalian protein and is unable, 
perhaps due to steric hindrance, to inhibit the Ada protein."
1748476,"Kupffer cells (KC), by virtue of their ability to present antigen (AP) and 
express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen (Ia), play a 
pivotal role in the host defence system against invading micro-organisms. 
Although haemorrhagic shock depresses the above KC functions, it is not known 
whether increased KC tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production and elevated TNF 
plasma levels following haemorrhage are responsible for it. To study this, 
C3H/HeN mice were pretreated intraperitoneally with either anti-murine TNF 
antibody (anti-TNF Ab) or saline. Twenty hours later mice were bled and 
maintained at a mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg for 60 min followed by adequate 
fluid resuscitation. Two and 24 hr later, plasma was collected and KC were 
isolated. AP was measured by co-culturing KC with the D10.G4.1 Th cell clone. Ia 
expression was determined by direct immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 
and TNF levels in KC supernatants and plasma were measured with bioassays or 
ELISA. Haemorrhage increased circulating TNF levels by 215% at 2 hr and by 76% 
at 24 hr (P less than 0.05), which was prevented by pretreatment with anti-TNF 
Ab. Haemorrhage-induced increase of circulating IL-6 was abolished (P less than 
0.05) at 2 hr but not at 24 hr in the anti-TNF Ab group. The suppression of KC 
AP (P less than 0.05) and Ia expression (P less than 0.05) due to haemorrhage 
was attenuated (P less than 0.05) in anti-TNF Ab-treated mice at 2 and 24 hr and 
KC IL-1 and TNF synthesis was further (P less than 0.01) increased. These 
results indicate that TNF plays a critical role in the initiation and regulation 
of KC AP, Ia expression, and cytokine production following haemorrhage."
1749589,"In 1975, we reported the remarkable case of a 42-year-old man with 
histologically proven widely disseminated reticulum cell sarcoma who, in a 
remarkably short time, appeared to enjoy not one, but two, complete spontaneous 
regressions of his fatal illness. Both these regressions coincided exactly in 
time with intravenous high-dose ascorbate administration, and it seemed 
reasonable to conclude that this unconventional therapy must have been 
responsible for his excellent responses. For those interested in spontaneous 
regressions of cancer and the possible mechanisms, we now report his subsequent 
progress some 17 years later."
1756602,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence at 
birth estimated at 1/2000-1/2500 livebirths in Caucasian populations. Some 127 
CF individuals are known in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ), a geographically 
isolated region of Quebec. The prevalence at birth was estimated at 1/902 live 
borns, and the carrier rate was estimated at 1/15 inhabitants in the SLSJ 
region. The mean inbreeding coefficient was only slightly elevated in the CF 
group compared with three control groups, and was due to remote consanguinity. 
The mean kinship coefficient was 2.4 times higher in the CF group than in the 
control groups. In SLSJ region, the places of origin of the CF individuals and 
their parents did not show a clustered nonuniform distribution. Endogamy was not 
higher in the CF group than in control groups."
1765991,"The development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after 38 months of therapy 
with recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) was observed in a patient 
with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to glomerulonephritis and a butterfly 
rash, previously negative tests for antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm 
antibodies became positive. We assume that rIFN-gamma induced the de novo 
development of SLE in our patient."
1771248,"The case of a patient with postirradiation osteosarcoma is presented. The 
20-year-old female was diagnosed as having osteosarcoma by histological 
examination of an open biopsy specimen. She underwent surgery for pure 
dysgerminoma and received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy, 40 Gy to the 
pelvis and 30 Gy to the para-aortic region, 11 years ago. This case satisfied 
the criteria for radiation-induced osteosarcoma proposed by Cahan et al. 
Radiation-induced osteosarcoma is rare, but the possibility of that must be 
borne in mind."
1774068,"The sensitivity and selectivity of the FASTA and the Smith-Waterman protein 
sequence comparison algorithms were evaluated using the superfamily 
classification provided in the National Biomedical Research Foundation/Protein 
Identification Resource (PIR) protein sequence database. Sequences from each of 
the 34 superfamilies in the PIR database with 20 or more members were compared 
against the protein sequence database. The similarity scores of the related and 
unrelated sequences were determined using either the FASTA program or the 
Smith-Waterman local similarity algorithm. These two sets of similarity scores 
were used to evaluate the ability of the two comparison algorithms to identify 
distantly related protein sequences. The FASTA program using the ktup = 2 
sensitivity setting performed as well as the Smith-Waterman algorithm for 19 of 
the 34 superfamilies. Increasing the sensitivity by setting ktup = 1 allowed 
FASTA to perform as well as Smith-Waterman on an additional 7 superfamilies. The 
rigorous Smith-Waterman method performed better than FASTA with ktup = 1 on 8 
superfamilies, including the globins, immunoglobulin variable regions, 
calmodulins, and plastocyanins. Several strategies for improving the sensitivity 
of FASTA were examined. The greatest improvement in sensitivity was achieved by 
optimizing a band around the best initial region found for every library 
sequence. For every superfamily except the globins and immunoglobulin variable 
regions, this strategy was as sensitive as a full Smith-Waterman. For some 
sequences, additional sensitivity was achieved by including conserved but 
nonidentical residues in the lookup table used to identify the initial region."
1776404,"The aim of the study was to determine, in a group of patients with 
therapy-resistant burning mouth syndrome (BMS), the possible deficiency of 
vitamins B1, B2, and B6 and the effect of proper vitamin replacement therapy. 
Sixteen individuals, aged 47 to 81 years, participated in the study. All 
underwent a base-line examination comprising anamnestic information, subjective 
assessment of symptoms, dietary registration, salivary analysis, and serum 
analysis of thiamine (B1), riboflavine (B2), and pyridoxine (B6). Fifteen 
individuals had low thiamine and/or riboflavine levels in accordance with 
suggested levels in the literature and were given replacement therapy. No effect 
on BMS of vitamin replacement therapy or placebo therapy could be demonstrated."
1777133,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is presumably caused by a slow infectious 
pathogen or prion. The principal clinical features of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
are dementia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, cerebellar 
dysfunction, and myoclonus. The patient rapidly deteriorates, declines to a 
vegetative state, becomes comatous, and is ultimately dead within several 
months. The authors present a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, proved by 
clinical findings, typical serial EEG, and pathologic features."
1779707,"There is an intimate association between sterol biosynthesis in yeast and 
aerobicity. Besides the requirement for molecular oxygen for the epoxidation of 
squalene, cytochrome hemoproteins are involved in demethylation and desaturation 
steps. Regulatory effects of hemes on sterol formation have been demonstrated 
using specifically defective mutants of yeast. Heme competency participates in a 
mechanism whereby wild-type cells are prevented from taking exogenous sterols 
from the growth media. The multiple interactions of hemes and sterols appear to 
be associated with the variously defined functions for sterols in the yeast 
cells."
1785632,"We describe a brother and sister with Hirschsprung disease, hypotonia, and 
ptosis. Their condition resembles that in 2 sibs reported by Goldberg and 
Shprintzen. We conclude that the clinical characteristics in 8 reported cases 
with similar clinical manifestations represent a distinct autosomal recessive 
syndrome, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome."
1788430,"A prospective study was performed on 4,262 consecutive patients who had had 
skull examinations for recent head trauma. Clinical signs and symptoms and 
patient history were correlated with skull fractures and intracranial sequelae 
as identified on CT studies, in order to evaluate the predictive value of each 
clinical finding and to identify high-yield referral criteria. Ninety-seven 
skull fractures (3%) and 32 intracranial sequelae (0.7%) were observed. All the 
intracranial complications were observed in patients with fractures and with 
altered consciousness of some degrees (Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 13). 
Most patients were asymptomatic (41%) or showed ""low risk"" symptoms (29%): among 
them, neither fractures nor complications were observed. High-risk clinical 
signs, mainly expressing basilar fractures (as rhinorrhea, otorrhea, focal 
neurologic signs, retroauricular hematoma) demonstrated high predictive value 
(100%) for intracranial sequelae. Other ""moderate risk"" findings for 
intracranial injury--i.e. loss of consciousness at any time, antegrade or 
retrograde amnesia, multiple trauma, and possible skull penetration--showed a 
high correlation with skull fractures and a slightly lower one with intracranial 
sequelae. The most predictive finding for brain injury was the depressed level 
of consciousness: brain injuries were never observed in fully conscious 
patients; in altered consciousness with GCS 15-13 we observed 4% of skull 
fractures with no sequelae; at GCS values 12-9, 61% of skull fractures and 20% 
of sequelae were present, whereas at GCS less than 8, 100% of complicated 
fracture were observed. The finding of skull fracture showed 33% of predictivity 
for brain damage, which was, however, always associated with ""high or moderate 
risk"" clinical signs. Therefore, the authors suggest some guidelines for the 
management of patients with recent head trauma, including referral criteria for 
X-rays or CT studies, based on signs and symptoms with high, intermediate and 
low risk of developing intracranial sequelae."
1789905,"Group A streptococcal strains were isolated from the throats of 46 children 
suffering from scarlet fever. For detection of erythrogenic toxins (ETs), the 
culture supernatants were concentrated 100 times by ethanol precipitation and 
solubilisation in acetate buffer. ELISA was used to identify ETA and double 
immunodiffusion to identify ETB and ETC. The presence of the ETA gene was 
detected by a specific DNA probe. ETA (alone or in combination with ETB and/or 
ETC) was found in 51.9% of the strains, ETB (alone or in combination with ETA 
and/or ETC) in 76.9% and ETC (in combination with ETA and ETB) in 28.9%. Only 
5.8% of strains did not produce any detectable ET. In SDS-PAGE, supernatants of 
ETB-producing strains showed a pronounced band in either the region of the 
proteinase zymogen or the active proteinase. There was no correlation between 
the type of erythrogenic toxin and the serological M or T type of the producing 
strain. The mitogenic potency of culture supernatants did not differ 
significantly irrespective of the toxin type(s) present. Culture supernatants of 
strains without a detectable amount of the known ETs were highly mitogenic, 
indicating the production of other streptococcal mitogens. A correlation with 
clinical symptoms was determined with regard to exanthema and fever. Strains 
producing two or three toxins caused a more intense exanthema. Patient 
temperature was higher (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) when the 
infecting strain produced ETB. The toxin-producing patterns of the strains of 
this study were compared with those isolated during the last epidemic outbreak 
of scarlet fever in East Germany."

diabetes mellitus (60%)."
1792854,"Seven patients, six suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and one 
from Friedreich ataxia, were treated with a placebo i.v. infusion during the 
first day and with TRH-T i.v. infusion at a rate of 2 mg/h for 8 h daily (total 
daily dosage 16 mg) on the 2 consecutive days. Continuous blood pressure (BP) 
and EKG monitorings were performed during 3 days infusion. Blood samples were 
collected for endocrinological evaluations. The neurological evaluation after 
acute TRH-T treatment showed an objective improvement in 3 of the 8. We found 
significantly higher values of systolic (max. difference of 10.1 mm Hg) and 
diastolic (max. difference of 8.8 mm Hg) BP than during placebo, beginning from 
the 5th h of the infusion (p less than 0.05). A trend in progressive increase of 
the heart rate (HR) reached statistical significance (p less than 0.01) at the 
8th h of the second TRH-T infusion. The cardiovascular changes during the i.v. 
continuous TRH-T infusions were clinically irrelevant and never required the

1793022,"We examined the therapeutic effect of 15-DOS in the two models of acute and 
chronic relapsing EAE in Lewis rats. In the first model adult rats developed an 
acute severe EAE and by day 16 all animals died. Lewis rats treated with 15-DOS 
showed a delayed and reduced onset of clinical symptoms and mortality was 
prevented. In the second model Lewis rats (aged animals) developed a chronic 
relapsing EAE with up to three relapses. The second and third episodes were both 
milder and shorter in duration. All animals treated with 15-DOS survived the 
delayed first attack and developed no further relapses."
1837999,"The authors investigated the role of atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP

following 20 min) in fourteen subjects: eight mild to moderate, untreated, 
essential hypertensives (EH) and six normotensive (N) controls, during 2 
hour-clearance periods, the 1st after ANP infusion, the 2nd during placebo (PL) 
administration. The double-blind study was carried out after the patients had 
rested and fasted overnight. It showed no significant changes in heart rate 
(HR); instead, compared with placebo, mean blood pressure (MBP) decreased 
significantly in both groups, beginning from the 3rd min after ANP infusion was 
begun (N: PL = 87.04 +/- 1.7 mmHg, ANP = 80.9 +/- 3.7 mmHg, p less than 0.0001; 
EH: PL = 102.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg, ANP = 97.7 +/- 5.9 mmHg, p less than 0.01). Among

ANP = 10.7 +/- 4.8 mEq/L, p less than 0.005), while no changes were noted in 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated as creatinine clearance, urinary 
magnesium, albumin and aldosterone excretion. To investigate other potential 
mechanisms involved in renal effects of ANP, the urinary excretion of both 
prostaglandins 6-cheto PGF1-alpha and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and dopamine were 
studied. The results showed only a significant decrease of dopamine urinary

relationships between T and B cell subpopulations. In MS patients we observed an 
increase of total lymphocyte count and an increase of CD4+CD29+ cells, which are 
adjuvant to B cell in antibody production. We hypothesized this change is 
related to the reduction of CD21+ cells, expressing B2 antigen which disappears 
after B cell activation. The unperfect balance of immune system in MS was also 
demonstrated by the increased level of CD25+ cells in relapsing-remitting

1849481,"The protein phosphatases which dephosphorylate native, sarcoplasmic reticulum 
(SR)-associated phospholamban were studied in cardiac muscle extracts and in a 
Triton fraction prepared by detergent extraction of myofibrils, the latter 
fraction containing 70-80% of the SR-associated proteins present in the tissue. 
At physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ (1 mM), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) 
accounted for approximately 70% of the total phospholamban phosphatase activity 
in these fractions towards either Ser-16 (the residue labelled by cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase, PK-A) or Thr-17 (the residue phosphorylated by an SR-associated 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and 
protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) accounted for the remainder of the activity. A 
major form of cardiac PP1, present in comparable amounts in both the extract and 
Triton fraction, was similar, if not identical, to skeletal muscle protein 
phosphatase 1G (PP1G), which is composed of the PP1 catalytic (C) subunit 
complexed to a G subunit of approximately 160 kDa, responsible for targeting PP1 
to both the SR and glycogen particles of skeletal muscle. This conclusion was 
based on immunoblotting experiments using antibody to the G subunit, ability to 
bind to glycogen and the release of PP1 activity from glycogen upon incubation 
with PK-A and MgATP. PP1 accounted for approximately 90% of the phospholamban 
(Ser-16 or Thr-17) phosphatase activity in the material sedimented by 
centrifugation at 45,000 x g, a fraction prepared from cardiac extracts which is 
enriched in SR membranes. The G subunit in this fraction could be solubilised by 
Triton X-100, but not with 0.5 M NaCl or digestion with alpha-amylase, 
indicating that it is bound to membranes and not to glycogen. By analogy with 
the situation in skeletal muscle, the PK-A catalysed phosphorylation of the G 
subunit, with ensuing release of the C subunit from the SR, may prevent PP1 from 
dephosphorylating SR-bound substrates and represent one of the mechanisms by 
which adrenalin increases the phosphorylation of cardiac phospholamban (Ser-16 
and Thr-17) in vivo. Hearts left in situ post mortem lose 85-95% of their PP1 
activity within 20-30 min. This remarkable disappearance of PP1 may partly 
explain why the importance of this enzyme in cardiac muscle metabolism has not 
been recognized previously."
1852180,"BACKGROUND: The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends a 
low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet, with weight loss if indicated, to 
correct elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Weight loss accomplished by simple 
caloric restriction or increased exercise typically increases the level of 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Little is known about the effects on 
plasma lipoproteins of a hypocaloric NCEP diet with or without exercise in 
overweight people.
METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that exercise (walking or jogging) will 
increase HDL cholesterol levels in moderately overweight, sedentary people who 
adopt a hypocaloric NCEP diet. We randomly assigned 132 men and 132 women 25 to 
49 years old to one of three groups: control, hypocaloric NCEP diet, or 
hypocaloric NCEP diet with exercise. One hundred nineteen of the men and 112 of 
the women returned for testing after one year.
RESULTS: After one year, the subjects in both intervention groups had reached or 
closely approached NCEP Step 1 dietary goals and reduced their mean body fat 
significantly (range of reduction in mean fat weight, 4.0 to 7.8 kg). Weight 
loss on the NCEP diet alone did not significantly change HDL cholesterol levels 
in either the men or the women as compared with the subjects in the control 
group. Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol increased significantly more in the men 
who exercised and dieted (mean [+/- SE] change, +13 +/- 3 percent) than in the 
men who only dieted (+2 +/- 3 percent, P less than 0.01) or the men who acted as 
controls (-4 +/- 2 percent, P less than 0.001). HDL cholesterol levels remained 
about the same in the women who exercised and dieted (+1 +/- 2 percent); they 
were higher than in the women who only dieted (-10 +/- 3 percent, P less than 
0.01), but not higher than in the controls (-3 +/- 3 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise in overweight men and women enhances the 
improvement in plasma lipoprotein levels that results from the adoption of a 
low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet."

the necessity of genetic evaluations for all patients with unexplained hydrops."
1856259,"The etiology of subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis (SAT) is uncertain, 
although it probably represents a nonspecific inflammatory response by the 
thyroid to a variety of viruses. It has been suggested that nonimmune processes 
are involved in SAT patients who have negative autoantibody titers. The disease 
has a variable course; although it is self-limited in most cases, some patients 
develop transient hypothyroidism, and others do not during the recovery period. 
The present study was performed to evaluate the occurrence of TSH receptor 
antibody (TRAb), measured by RRA (TSH binding inhibitor), TRAb measured by 
stimulation assay (thyroid-stimulating antibody), and TRAb measured by blocking 
assay [TSH-blocking antibody (TSH-BAb)] activity in 68 patients with SAT who had 
negative autoantibody titers. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group I, 
31 patients who developed hypothyroidism during the recovery period; and group 
II, 37 patients who remained euthyroid during recovery. Positive immunoglobulin 
activity occurred in about 20% of group I patients during follow-up, but in only 
3% of group II patients. About 20% of group I patients developed positive 
TSH-BAb activity and were hypothyroid, requiring exogenous hormone therapy for 
1.2-3.5 yr, whereas hypothyroidism was relatively transient in group I patients 
who had negative TSH-BAb activity (2-6 months). Although increased TSH-BAb 
activity may account for hypothyroidism in some patients with SAT, the precise 
mechanism for the development of transient hypothyroidism in SAT remains 
enigmatic."
1859393,"Titin, the largest protein identified to date (over 1 micron long, almost 3 
million daltons in mass) is the third most abundant component of the sarcomere. 
In the mature myofibril, titin molecules span from M line to Z line, forming a 
third filament system which provides sarcomeric alignment and elastic recoil. In 
the developing sarcomere, accumulating evidence from studies both in vivo and in 
vitro implicates titin as part of a morphogenetic scaffolding, upon which 
critical events in myofibrillogenesis are coordinated in a time- and 
space-dependent manner."
1859661,"The treatment of hypothyroidism in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass 
surgery is a difficult clinical problem. To determine perioperative thyroid 
replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism, plasma total thyroxine 
(T4), total triiodothyroxine (T3), free T4, free T3 and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone levels were measured preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after 
operation in 9 patients with hypothyroidism and were compared with levels in 14 
patients with normal thyroid function who underwent coronary bypass surgery. In 
the normal control group, total T4 decreased to its lowest level on the 1st 
postoperative day and then increased gradually to the preoperative level at 7 
days. Total T4 remained within the normal range throughout the entire 
postoperative course. In 6 patients with hypothyroidism who were treated with 
thyroid hormone before surgery, total T4 decreased immediately after operation 
and only increased after starting thyroid replacement therapy. In 3 hypothyroid 
patients without prior thyroid replacement, total T4 showed a change similar to 
patients in the control group but remained below the normal range until starting 
thyroid replacement therapy. Coronary bypass surgery was performed safely in 
patients with hypothyroidism. Preoperative thyroid replacement with suboptimal 
doses was safe in patients with severe hypothyroidism. Adequate postoperative 
thyroid replacement was achieved in all patients without complications."
1860177,"Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein known to sequester calcium 
accumulated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells during 
relaxation. In the present study, we used affinity-purified antibodies to 
chicken cardiac calsequestrin to identify a 60,000-Da calsequestrin in frog 
myocardium. Like previously identified cardiac calsequestrins, it is enriched in 
cardiac microsomes, it is enriched by biochemical procedures previously used to 
purify cardiac and skeletal calsequestrins, and it exhibits a pH-dependent shift 
in its apparent Mr on a two-dimensional gel system. Finally, the NH2-terminal 
amino acid sequence of this 60,000-Da immunoreactive protein purified by fast 
protein liquid chromatography was identical to that of rabbit skeletal and 
canine cardiac calsequestrin. Thus, we conclude that this protein corresponds to 
the calsequestrin isoform in frog ventricular muscle. Frog calsequestrin was 
localized in discrete foci present at the periphery but absent from the central 
regions of frog ventricular myocytes as determined by immunofluorescence 
labeling. Immunoelectron microscopic labeling demonstrated that calsequestrin 
was confined to the lumen of two structurally distinct regions of the SR, where 
it was localized in the subsarcolemmal region of the myofibers. One of these 
appeared to correspond to the terminal SR previously reported to be closely 
apposed to the sarcolemma of frog myofibers. The other region, although close to 
the sarcolemma, was not physically joined to it and appeared to correspond to 
corbular SR. It generally is believed that frog cardiac SR does not provide 
activator Ca2+ required for excitation-contraction coupling. However, the 
identification of a calsequestrin isoform very similar to mammalian cardiac 
calsequestrin that is confined to specialized regions of frog cardiac SR lends 
support to the idea that frog cardiac SR has the ability to store Ca2+ and thus 
function in some capacity in frog cardiac muscle contraction."
1861211,"Alpers disease consists of diffuse cerebral degeneration manifested as 
developmental delay, seizures, vomiting, and progressive neuromuscular 
deterioration, with liver disease and death. We report the clinical course of 
the liver disease, histologic progression of the hepatic lesions, and etiologic 
investigations in five patients (four girls, three kinships). All had grown and 
developed normally until seen at 6 to 36 months of age (mean 20 months), with 
vomiting (n = 5), progressive hypotonia (n = 3), or seizures (n = 2). All had 
been given anticonvulsants, including valproic acid in three. Liver disease was 
noted at a mean age of 35 months (range 9 to 67 months), with hepatomegaly (two 
patients), abnormal hepatic synthetic function (three) or transaminase values 
(three), and cirrhosis in one. Patients survived for a mean of 4.6 weeks (range 
1 to 8 weeks) after the identification of liver disease; all died of hepatic 
failure. Results of evaluation for infectious and metabolic causes of liver 
disease and causes of degenerative neuromuscular disease were negative in all 
patients. Premortem liver biopsy specimens (n = 3) demonstrated an early lesion 
consisting of lobular disarray, microvesicular steatosis, periportal acute and 
chronic inflammation, and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Autopsy findings (n = 
5) consisted of macrovesicular steatosis, massive hepatocyte dropout, and 
proliferation of bile ductular elements, with almost complete replacement of 
hepatocytes by proliferating bile ductular elements in two patients. Brain 
showed characteristic neuronal degeneration. We conclude that Alpers disease can 
be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the 
cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be 
related to peroxisomal dysfunction."
1864770,"We conducted a 12-wk resistance training program in elderly women [mean age 69 
+/- 1.0 (SE) yr] to determine whether increases in muscle strength are 
associated with changes in cross-sectional fiber area of the vastus lateralis 
muscle. Twenty-seven healthy women were randomly assigned to either a control or 
exercise group. The program was satisfactorily completed and adequate biopsy 
material obtained from 6 controls and 13 exercisers. After initial testing of 
baseline maximal strength, exercisers began a training regimen consisting of 
seven exercises that stressed primary muscle groups of the lower extremities. No 
active intervention was prescribed for the controls. Increases in muscle 
strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline 
values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. No significant strength changes were 
observed in the controls. Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers 
significantly increased in the exercisers (20.1 +/- 6.8%, P = 0.02) compared 
with baseline. In contrast, no significant change in type II fiber area was 
observed in the controls. No significant changes in type I fiber area were found 
in either group. We conclude that a program of resistance exercise can be safely 
carried out by elderly women, such a program significantly increases muscle 
strength, and such gains are due, at least in part, to muscle hypertrophy."
1865568,"The clinical course and prognosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was 
compared in patients with deletions of the gene for dystrophin (cDMD) and those 
without such deletions. A total of 24 patients was followed for at least 2 yrs. 
At age 12 the rating of the activities of daily life (ADL) and disease stage 
were less favorable in those patients with deletions of the gene for cDMD. At 
age 14, no difference in ADL and disease stage was observed between the two 
groups. The percent vital capacity was lower in those patients with the cDMD 
deficit. When the prognosis was evaluated by multivariate analysis of the data 
obtained at age 12, the percent of patients predicted as dying before the age of 
20 was 40% for those without the cDMD deficit but 76% for those who were cDMD 
defective. None of the cDMD defective patients lived longer than 20 yrs, whereas 
5 of 14 patients without the cDND deficit survived longer than 20 yrs. Disorders 
such as cardiac and respiratory failure were also seen more frequently in the 
cDND defective patients. These results suggest that patients with Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy with defective cDMD have more severe disease than those 
without cDMD deficit."
1867186,"A right adrenal tumor was found incidentally by renal echography in a 
25-year-old man, who had been on hemodialysis for 4 years. Inquiry and clinical 
examination suggested pheochromocytoma, which was confirmed by plasma 
catecholamine measurements. Subsequent adrenalectomy was uneventful. Although 
hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis are common symptoms in a dialyzed 
patient, pheochromocytoma has to be eliminated in the presence of this clinical 
triad."
1867260,"We have investigated the possibility of mutations in the calcitonin/calcitonin 
gene related peptide (CGRP) gene in children with Williams syndrome. Involvement 
of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that 
Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient 
expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. To test 
the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible 
for the reduced calcitonin levels, we examined the calcitonin/CGRP gene 
structure in Williams syndrome children. Analysis of white blood cell DNA by 
Southern blot hybridizations in 5 individuals did not show any detectable large 
deletions or rearrangements in the calcitonin/CGRP gene locus. The possibility 
of small deletions or point mutations within the exon encoding the mature 
calcitonin hormone is unlikely based on ribonuclease protection assays with 
patient DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. These 
findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations 
elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for 
calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion."
1867320,"Monoclonal antibody (MAb) HBA71, which was raised against Ewing's sarcoma cells, 
recognizes a cell-surface glycoprotein, p30/32MIC2, that is encoded by the MIC2 
gene in the pseudoautosomal region of human chromosomes X and Y. This 
immunohistochemical study evaluates the specificity and sensitivity of MAb HBA71 
for tumor diagnosis. Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues of more than 300 
tumors of diverse histologic type, including more than 100 small round cell 
tumors of childhood and adolescence, were tested with this MAb by the 
avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure. The authors found HBA71 
immunoreactivity in 61 of 63 Ewing's sarcomas studied and 9 of 11 primitive 
neuroectodermal tumors and peripheral neuroepitheliomas. HBA71-negative tumors 
included neuroblastomas (0 of 24), melanomas (0 of 13), an 
esthesioneuroblastoma, small cell osteosarcomas (0 of 2), a malignant 
ectomesenchymoma, desmoplastic SRCT (0 of 5), and medulloblastomas (0 of 5). 
Heterogeneous expression of HBA71 immunostaining was found in some embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcomas (3 of 14) and astrocytomas (4 of 7), and in a few 
neuroendocrine tumors (4 of 26), carcinomas (3 of 94), and lymphomas (6 of 30). 
Because Ewing's sarcomas are consistently HBA71 positive, the authors searched 
for antigen-positive normal cells that may represent precursors for these 
tumors; however, no obvious candidate for the elusive cell of origin for Ewing's 
sarcoma was identified in the normal fetal tissues tested. Their findings 
indicate that HBA71 is a highly restricted cell-surface antigen of Ewing's 
sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and immunohistochemistry 
employing this antibody may be of value in the differential diagnosis of 
selected small round cell tumors in childhood and adolescence."
1873324,"61 patients with symptoms suggestive for gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) disease, 
with or without endoscopic evidence of esophagitis, were studied in order to 
recognize any neurotic traits connected to GERD and its esophageal motility 
disorders. The results were compared with those from a group of patients without 
digestive diseases as well as those from a control group of the same age and 
status. Psychological assessment was made by using the Middlesex Hospital 
Questionnaire and esophageal motility pattern was analyzed with a low-compliance 
manometric system. Patients with gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), irrespectively 
or not from esophagitis, showed, after such a psychological assessment, neurotic 
traits more pronounced than control subjects and patients without digestive 
disease. In GER patients, it was observed a close relationship between some 
psychological traits and a few esophageal manometric variable. In the two groups 
of GER patients, with and without esophagitis, it was not found any significant 
difference in scores referring to the evaluated psychological traits apart from 
symptoms somatization, prevailing in GER patients without esophagitis. These 
results support the pathogenetic role of psychological distresses in the genesis 
of GER, even if other factors may be necessary to the development of organic 
inflammatory lesions such as esophagitis."
1883358,"We have previously identified a silencer (negative enhancer) in glutathione 
transferase P (GST-P) gene which is strongly and specifically induced during 
hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat. At least three trans-acting factors bind to 
multiple cis-elements located in this silencer. One of these factors, SF-B 
(Silencer Factor B) specifically binds to GPS1 (GST-P Silencer 1) and has been 
cloned by a Southwestern protocol. Analysis of DNA and deduced amino acid 
sequence reveals that SF-B clone is most likely identical to an IL-6 inducible 
trans-activator LAP/IL6-DBP. Binding efficiency of SF-B to GPS1 is 
indistinguishable from that to IL6-responsive element found in C-reactive 
protein gene. The possibility that SF-B/LAP/IL6-DBP functions as a dual positive 
and negative regulator is discussed."
1884116,"1. Although (+)-tubocurarine (Tc) is classically considered to be a competitive 
antagonist at the neuromuscular junction, kinetic details of the interaction 
remain unclear. 2. We studied the competitive action of Tc on the nicotinic 
receptor at the frog neuromuscular junction using a quantitative analysis of the 
generation phase of miniature endplate currents (m.e.p.cs) recorded in Ringer 
solution (20 degrees C) under voltage clamp (-90 mV) in the absence or presence 
of 1-5 microM Tc. Under control conditions four neurotransmission parameters 
were estimated by non-linear regression using a mathematical model of synaptic 
transmission incorporating transmitter release, diffusion, hydrolysis, receptor 
binding and channel gating. These parameters were then used in a further 
regression to estimate binding rate constants for Tc at the same endplate. 
Allowance was made for open channel block by Tc, which under the conditions of 
this study was only a small component of total blockade. 3. The results suggest 
that Tc binds to the two agonist recognition sites on the nicotinic receptor 
with equal affinity (stoichiometric KDs of 2.2 and 8.8 microM), and that most of 
the functional blockade at concentrations up to 5 microM is due to occupancy of 
only one site. 4. The association rate constant for Tc binding to sites on the 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be very fast (k+D = 8.9 x 10(8) M-1 
s-1) and comparable to that for acetylcholine (ACh). 5. In the brief time during 
which an m.e.p.c. is generated (approximately 200 microseconds, reversal of Tc 
blockade by transiently high concentrations of ACh seems to be kinetically 
limited."
1885560,"We have expressed a cDNA to human apolipoprotein E (apoE) in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Secretion of apoE was achieved only by the use of a mutant (upc2) 
strain of yeast with the phenotype of enhanced uptake and intracellular 
esterification of exogenous cholesterol. Approximately 40 ng/ml apoE was 
secreted by upc2 mutants in the absence of media cholesterol. ApoE secretion was 
increased 2-3-fold upon the inclusion of cholesterol in the growth media. This 
response to exogenous cholesterol was not mediated at the transcriptional level, 
since apoE mRNA levels were constant under all culture conditions. Concomitant 
with the increase in secretion following cholesterol uptake by upc2 strains, 
approximately 5% of secreted apoE was associated with lipid; polar and non-polar 
lipids were detected in this lipoprotein fraction. Intracellular degradation of 
apoE in non-secreting strains of yeast was minimized by the presence of null 
mutations in both vacuolar proteases with non-specific activity (pep4) and a 
Golgi endopeptidase with specificity for paired basic residues (kex2). The 
approach of expressing human apolipoproteins in yeast may identify factors that 
mediate lipoprotein biosynthesis in higher cells. One such factor could be the 
mammalian equivalent of the gene product of UPC2."
1887835,"The life and personality of Johann Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), the founder of 
scientific genetics, are reviewed against the contemporary background of his 
times. At the end are weighed the benefits for Mendel (as charged by Sir Ronald 
Fisher) to have documented his results on hand of falsified data. Mendel was 
born into a humble farm family in the ""Kuhländchen"", then a predominantly German 
area of Northern Moravia. On the basis of great gifts Mendel was able to begin 
higher studies; however, he found himself in serious financial difficulties 
because of his father's accident and incapacitation. His hardships engendered 
illness which threatened continuation and completion of his studies until he was 
afforded the chance of absolving successfully theological studies as an 
Augustinian monk in the famous chapter of St. Thomas in Altbrünn (Staré Brno). 
Psychosomatic indisposition made Mendel unfit for practical pastoral duties. 
Thus, he was directed to teach but without appropriate state certification; an 
attempt to pass such an examination failed. At that point he was sent to the 
University of Vienna for a 2-year course of studies, with emphasis on physics 
and botany, to prepare him for the exam. His scientific and methodologic 
training enabled him to plan studies of the laws of inheritance, which had begun 
to interest him already during his theology training, and to choose the 
appropriate experimental plant. In 1865, after 12 years of systematic 
investigations on peas, he presented his results in the famous paper ""Versuche 
über Pflanzenhybriden."" Three years after his return from Vienna he failed to 
attain his teaching certification a second time. Only by virtue of his 
exceptional qualifications did he continue to function as a Supplementary 
Professor of Physics and Natural History in the two lowest classes of a 
secondary school. In 1868 he was elected Abbot of his chapter, and freed from 
teaching duties, was able to pursue his many scientific interests with greater 
efficiency. This included meteorology, the measurement of ground water levels, 
further hybridization in plants (a.o. involving the hawk week Hieracium up to 
about 1873), vegetable and fruit tree horticulture, apiculture, and agriculture 
in general. This involved Mendel's active participation in many organizations 
interested in advancing these fields at a time when appropriate research 
institutes did not exist in Brünn. Some of the positions he took in his capacity 
of Abbot had severe repercussions and further taxed Mendel's already 
over-stressed system. The worst of these was a 10-year confrontation with the 
government about the taxation of the monastery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
1888465,"The cardiac valves develop from the endocardial cushions of the fetus. Some 
congenital anomalies such as the 21-trisomy syndrome (Down syndrome) show poorly 
differentiated immature valves similar to those under development. The normally 
mature valves have four layers of the connective tissue, i.e., proximalis, 
spongiosa, fibrosa and distalis. Gargoylism promotes abnormal thickening of 
collagen fibers in the fibrosa via acid-mucopolysaccharide (aMPS) 
overproduction, but Marfan syndrome weakens the valves in spite of increased 
aMPS. The reversed conditions could be caused by the difference of increased 
aMPS; i.e., dermatan sulfate B or heparitin sulfate in gargoylism, on the 
contrary, dermatan sulfate A and C or hyaluronic acid in Marfan syndrome. 
Hemodynamic changes in the valves consist of diffuse hypertrophy of the 
proximalis and fibrosa in high flow cases and focal thickening of the proximalis 
at the line of closure and of the spongiosa at the anatomical edge in high 
pressure cases. Aging of the valves simulates partly the hemodynamic changes but 
degeneration of collagen fibers in the fibrosa after consumption of the 
spongiosa is more prominent than the latter. So-called myxomatous degeneration 
in the mitral valve prolapse cases seems reactive hypertrophy of the spongiosa 
replacing the interrupted fibrosa. Spontaneous chordal rupture is partly related 
to myxomatous change, but that in the elderly cases shows only simple disruption 
of collagen fibers with loss of the spongiosa tissue. Calcification of the 
valvular rings and bodies often observed in the elderly cases with parallelism 
to degeneration of the connective tissue produces mitral regurgitation, aortic 
stenosis or both, showing a preponderance of females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

1888865,"The carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy due to trapping (focal lesion of the 
peripheral nerve due to a local cause); in this case, the median nerve is the 
most commonly involved. Its presentation is characteristic in females about 40 
years of age. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features and is 
confirmed by electrical criteria. In the anamnesis it is important to consider 
systemic diseases as causing the abnormality. Treatment depends on the etiology. 
It may be medical or surgical. In the present article we report three cases with 
different etiology and treatment. We also review the syndrome."
1893943,"During chromatin replication and nucleosome assembly, newly synthesized histone 
H4 is acetylated before it is deposited onto DNA, then deacetylated as assembly 
proceeds. In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 
[1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium 
butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to 
mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more 
soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin). 
In the following report the relationships between chromatin replication, histone 
acetylation, and H1-mediated nucleosome aggregation were further investigated. 
Chromatin was replicated in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; isolated 
nucleosomes were stripped of linker histone, reconstituted with H1, and treated 
to produce Mg(2+)-soluble and Mg(2+)-insoluble chromatin fractions. Following 
the removal of H1, all solubility differences between chromatin replicated in 
sodium butyrate for 30 min (bu-chromatin) and control chromatin were lost. 
Reconstitution with H1 completely restored the preferential Mg(2+)-solubility of 
bu-chromatin, demonstrating that a reduced capacity for aggregation/condensation 
is an inherent feature of acetylated nascent nucleosomes; however, titration 
with excess H1 caused the solubility differences to be lost again. Moreover, 
when the core histone N-terminal ""tails"" (the sites of acetylation) were removed 
by trypsinization prior to reconstitution, H1 was unable to reestablish the 
altered solubility of chromatin replicated in butyrate. Thus, the core histone 
""tails,"" and the acetylation thereof, not only modulate H1-mediated nucleosome 
interactions in vitro, but also strongly influence the ability of H1 to 
differentiate between new and old nucleosomes. The data suggest a possible 
mechanism for the control of H1 deposition and/or chromatin folding during 
nucleosome assembly."
1896669,"Among 93 patients presenting the typical symptoms of a Ménière's disease 
associating an unilateral fluctuating hearing loss of sensorineural type, 
tinnitus and vertiginous attacks lasting minutes to hours, 40 patients (43%) 
presented in their personal history a particular otologic insult in the ear 
which later on developed into the full Ménière's symptomatology, or a particular 
systemic disease with otologic manifestations. The Ménière's triad appeared in 
these patients six months to twenty nine years after the initial otologic or 
systemic lesion. Among these initial lesions were 16 cases of sudden partial or 
complete deafness related to viral or bacterial infection, 3 cases of sudden 
cochleo-vestibular deficit and 1 case of vestibular neuritis, 5 cases of 
temporal bone fractures and 4 cases of significant acoustic trauma, 2 cases of 
otosclerosis, 1 case of chronicotitis media and 1 case of severe hearing loss 
after otologic surgery, 5 cases of meningo-encephalitis and 2 cases of acquired 
syphilis. These particular lesion could be, in our opinion, the releasing factor 
of the inner ear dysfonction leading eventually to a secondary Ménière's 
syndrome."
1896679,"Vertigo is the most important symptom of Ménière's disease both from the 
standpoint of follow-up and indication for surgery. But although vertigo is an 
alerting symptom for both the patient and the physician, we believe that the 
hearing level is the most reliable and even the single sign in determining the 
recent status of the disease. Between 1983-1989, 42 patients with various types 
of Ménière's disease (MD) (34 typical MD, 3 cochlear MD and 3 vestibular MD) 
underwent endolymphatic sac surgery at ENT department of Gazi University School 
of Medicine. In the typical MD group, patients with a duration of symptoms of 
less than one year prior to surgery revealed better postoperative results; 91% 
fell into class A and B, whereas this rate was found to be lower (40%) in 
patients with symptomatology lasting for more than one year. In conclusion, 
especially in bilateral cases, given the importance of the hearing, early sac 
surgery is thoroughly recommended for the conservation of hearing."
1896728,"Attention has recently been drawn to a condition termed the exploding head 
syndrome, which is characterized by unpleasant, even terrifying sensations of 
flashing lights and/or sounds during reported sleep. Nine patients complaining 
of sensations of explosions in the head during sleep or drowsiness were 
investigated with polysomnographic recordings. None of them had any neurological 
disorder. Five patients reported explosions during the recording sessions. 
According to the recordings, the attacks always took place when the patients 
were awake and relaxed. In two cases abrupt electroencephalographic (EEG) and 
electromyographic changes indicating increasing alertness were recorded at the 
time of the reported attacks. In the remaining three cases no EEG changes were 
seen. Thus, there were no indications of an epileptic etiology to the condition. 
In all patients the symptoms ameliorated spontaneously with time. The severity 
of the symptoms was reduced by reassurance of the harmlessness of the condition. 
Clomipramine was prescribed to three patients who all reported immediate relief 
of symptoms. It is concluded that symptoms of this type are probably not true 
hypnagogic phenomena but may be an expression of emotional stress in the awake 
state."

from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed 
in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and 
in four normal relatives used as controls. The controls showed both chromosome 
17 homologues labeled in 85%-95% of cells, while each patient showed only one 
homologue labeled in 75%-80% of cells. Two MDS patients with cryptic 
translocations were also studied. In one case, a patient and her mother had the 
same der(17) (p+), but the reciprocal product of the translocation could not be 
identified in the mother by G-banding (i.e., it was a ""half-cryptic"" 
translocation). FISH revealed a 3q;17p translocation. The other case involved a 
patient with apparently normal karyotype. Because a large molecular deletion was 
found, a translocation involving two G-negative telomeres (i.e., a 
""full-cryptic"" translocation) was postulated. FISH studies on her father and 
normal brother showed an 8q;17p translocation. These studies demonstrate that in 
situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in 
Miller-Dieker syndrome. More important, parental studies by FISH on patients 
demonstrating molecular deletions and a normal karyotype may identify cryptic 
translocation events, which cannot be detected by other molecular genetic 
strategies. Similar in situ strategies for deletion detection can be developed 
for other microdeletion syndromes, such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome or 
DiGeorge syndrome."
1899336,"Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most 
prevalent lysosomal storage disease. Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic 
variation and molecular heterogeneity, and several simple and complex alleles of 
the acid beta-glucosidase gene have been identified as causal to this disease. 
Certain combinations of alleles have been shown to correlate well with the 
severity of the disease, but many Gaucher disease patients exist whose disease 
is not explained by any of the published mutations. This study was undertaken to 
identify mutant alleles in such incompletely characterized Gaucher disease, in 
an attempt to find further correlations between clinical phenotype and the 
presence of acid beta-glucosidase alleles. RNA was isolated from Gaucher cell 
lines and converted to cDNA, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned, and 
several clones for each allele were sequenced. Several new singly mutated and 
multiply mutated alleles were identified, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide 
hybridization was used to verify the presence of these mutations in the genome 
of these patients. All newly identified mutations occurred only rarely in the 
Gaucher disease population, making it difficult to determine whether inheritance 
of a particular combination of alleles always correlates with the clinical 
manifestations seen in the test patients. Three of the newly described alleles 
were single missense mutations in exon 8, one was a single missense mutation in 
exon 5, and the fifth was a complex allele, comprising a series of different 
point mutations scattered throughout exons 5 and 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

1901182,"The public immunization program against diphtheria, established in 1941, has 
almost eradicated the disease in Denmark, and 1956 became the first year without 
any notified cases. Since then, toxigenic strains have only been isolated five 
times--three cases of clinical diphtheria due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae 
biovar. mitis and two cases of tonsillitis/pharyngitis due to Corynebacterium 
ulcerans. The source of the infection was not identified in any of the cases. 
The first case of diphtheria in 1968 was imported from abroad. The following two 
cases in 1983 and 1985 were due to strains of the same phage type and peptide 
profile as the strains isolated during the epidemic in Sweden in 1984-1986. This 
indicates that the Danish cases and the Swedish epidemic derived from the same 
source. The diphtheria immunity of the Danish population is decreasing, and the 
level of protection is approaching the Swedish level. The impact is that a 
situation like that in Sweden may be anticipated with diphtheria epidemic in the 
lowest socio-economical groups--the skid row dwellers, alcoholics and drug 
abusers--if the immunization program against diphtheria is not intensified."
1901428,"Katayama fever or acute schistosomiasis probably occurs more commonly than is 
recorded. Interviews with a 3-man scuba diving team who had had contact with a 
large dam in an endemic area of the eastern Transvaal Lowveld at the same time 
and contact area on the same day during late summer of 1986 are discussed. Two, 
who had not previously been exposed to infected water, presented with Katayama 
fever, due to Schistosoma mansoni infection, 21 days after contact and it took 
30-36 months for them to recover fully after several treatments. The third 
patient, a keen water-sportsman and resident in the endemic area for a period of 
10 years, presented with a mild infection, probably due to acquired immunity 
initiated during previous contacts with infected water; he took about a year to 
recover. The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the 3 
cases are described in the light of recent observations made elsewhere on 
Katayama fever cases and the effects of chemotherapy on the course of illness. 
The necessity of obtaining basic information on the travel and water-contact 
activities of patients in order to make a diagnosis is emphasised."
1903389,"A survey of marine unicellular cyanobacterial strains for phycobiliproteins with 
high phycourobilin (PUB) content led to a detailed investigation of 
Synechocystis sp. WH8501. The phycobiliproteins of this strain were purified and 
characterized with respect to their bilin composition and attachment sites. 
Amino-terminal sequences were determined for the alpha and beta subunits of the 
phycocyanin and the major and minor phycoerythrins. The amino acid sequences 
around the attachment sites of all bilin prosthetic groups of the phycocyanin 
and of the minor phycoerythrin were also determined. The phycocyanin from this 
strain carries a single PUB on the alpha subunit and two phycocyanobilins on the 
beta subunit. It is the only phycocyanin known to carry a PUB chromophore. The 
native protein, isolated in the (alpha beta)2 aggregation state, displays 
absorption maxima at 490 and 592 nm. Excitation at 470 nm, absorbed almost 
exclusively by PUB, leads to emission at 644 nm from phycocyanobilin. The major 
and minor phycoerythrins from strain WH8501 each carry five bilins per alpha 
beta unit, four PUBs and one phycoerythrobilin. Spectroscopic properties 
determine that the PUB groups function as energy donors to the sole 
phycoerythrobilin. Analysis of the bilin peptides unambiguously identifies the 
phycoerythrobilin at position beta-82 (residue numbering assigned by homology 
with B-phycoerythrin; Sidler, W., Kumpf, B., Suter, F., Klotz, A. V., Glazer, A.

energy acceptor in phycoerythrins."
1904337,"A 64-year-old woman who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with disturbance 
of vertical ocular movement was presented. She was admitted to our hospital with 
progressive dysphagia, dysarythria and weakness of the extremities. Neurological 
examinations revealed disturbance of vertical ocular movement with normal doll's 
eye phenomenon (supranuclear origin), bulbar palsy, muscle weakness of the 
extremities, extensor plantar signs, and fasciculations of the costal and 
interosseal muscles. EMG studies showed denervation potentials, and muscle 
biopsy demonstrated group atrophy, fiber type grouping and small angular fibers. 
TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular 
movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. There was about 20 
Japanese cases with disturbance of ocular movement in ALS, but it was rare to 
see ocular movement disorder from the early stage of ALS. The pathophysiology of 
ocular movement disorder in ALS has been thought to be due to supranuclear 
origin, i.e., the disturbance in the pathway from the frontal cortex to the 
mesencephalon. In this case, TRH might effect at some point of the 
frontomesencephalic pathway."
1904482,"Cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys have been studied via PET with [18F]-L-6 
fluorodopa tracer. Striatal fluorodopa uptake rate constants have been derived 
by graphical analysis of transaxial slice images centered on the striata. The 
differences between pairs of values of the rate constant, obtained from two 
scans on the same monkey separated by two weeks or more, exhibited a relative 
standard deviation of 34.4%. If the two scans were conducted one immediately 
after the other, with the position of the monkey undisturbed, the standard 
deviation was reduced to 14.0%. The utility of this technique was demonstrated 
by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia 
and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of 
L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. With NSD 1015, 
the fluorodopa uptake constant was reduced by an average of 76.0%."
1905075,"Unlike the Peyer's patches of rats and mice, which are considered to be 
secondary lymphoid organs, the ileal Peyer's patch of sheep is thought to be 
responsible for the primary generation of B cells, like the bursa of Fabricius 
of birds. The ileal Peyer's patch of sheep shows prenatal maturation, 
antigen-independent lymphopoiesis, a rate of lymphocyte production larger than 
that of the thymus, and involution at a young age. Follicles contain few T cells 
and have an IgM+, relatively immature B lymphocyte population, as judged by 
B-cell differentiation markers. The follicle-associated epithelium of the ileal 
Peyer's patch is of a special type that sheds carbonic anhydrase-rich, 
50-nanometer membrane-bounded particles (carbonic anhydrase-reactive particles; 
CAP) into the intercellular spaces. The CAP filter into the follicle centre and 
are taken up by lymphocytes. They represent the epithelial (bursa-like) element 
in an otherwise mesenchymal stroma of reticular cells embedding the follicle 
lymphocytes. Transepithelial transport of macromolecules, with the formation of 
multivesicular body-like cytoplasmic vacuoles, appears to be the basis for CAP 
formation. The jejunal Peyer's patches are devoid of CAP, persist in the adult 
animal, contain M cells with clusters of B cells in the follicle-associated 
epithelium, and have many CD4+ lymphocytes in the follicles and in the 
interfollicular areas. Aggregates of lymphoid follicles in the large intestine 
resemble the jejunal Peyer's patches with respect to their lymphocyte population 
and the ileal Peyer's patch with respect to their follicle-associated 
epithelium."
1905879,"Mutations in the gene for the pigment-producing enzyme tyrosinase are 
responsible for type IA (tyrosinase-negative) oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). 
Most reported mutations have been single base substitutions. We now report three 
different frameshift mutations in three unrelated individuals with type IA OCA. 
The first individual has a single base deletion within a series of five 
guanidines, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon I on one allele and a 
missense mutation at codon 382 in exon III on the homologous allele. The second 
individual is a genetic compound of two separate frameshift mutations, including 
both the same exon I single base deletion found in the first individual and a 
deletion of a thymidine-guanidine pair, within the sequence GTGTG, forming a 
termination codon (TAG) in exon I on the homologous allele. The third individual 
has a single base insertion in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at 
codon 373 in exon III on the homologous allele. The two missense mutations occur 
within the copper Bbinding region and may interfere with either copper binding 
to the enzyme or oxygen binding to the copper. These five different mutations 
disrupt tyrosinase function and are associated with a total lack of melanin 
biosynthesis."
1906441,"30 subjects--23 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 4 with Charcot-Marie 
Tooth atrophy, 2 with progressive spinal muscle atrophy and 1 with radiation 
myelopathy--were given chronic low-dose TRH therapy. The effects of treatment 
were assessed on the scale of Norris et al. (1974). The outcome of the study, in 
agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a 
statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients 
but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other 
neurological diseases."
1908009,"Segregation analysis on five samples of families with Hunter's syndrome (158 
cases overall) shows that the mutant allele segregates in agreement with 
Mendelian expectations for an X linked recessive disease, but the proportion of 
sporadic cases is significantly lower than expected under mutation-selection 
equilibrium. Heterogeneity among the samples is apparent, but it is caused 
entirely by a sample of Ashkenazi families, whose segregation pattern has 
previously been interpreted as supporting the hypothesis of prenatal selection 
in favour of the pathological allele. Conversely, our joint analysis of the five 
samples by a maximum likelihood approach does not suggest segregation 
distortion. Possible reasons for the apparent lack of sporadic cases include the 
effect of ascertainment bias."
1909089,"GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the 
lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene. While its phenotypic expression is 
complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult 
form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and 
severity of central nervous system involvement. We have analyzed the acid 
beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families. The aim was 
to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible 
correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes. Northern blotting 
studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA 
ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients 
but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients. Four 
distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective 
clinical forms within our small-size samples. In the infantile patient with 
decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in 
Arg49----Cys. In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation 
Arg457----Ter was identified. The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four 
of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the 
point mutation Ile51----Thr. The mutations found in the juvenile and adult 
patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to 
quick screening. The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the 
clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the 
mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

1910520,"Mass spectrometric analysis of the stable carbon isotope composition (13C/12C or 
delta 13C) of bone collagen from human remains recovered at archaeological sites 
provides a direct chemical method for investigating dietary patterns of 
prehistoric human populations. This methodology is based on the facts that (1) 
different food items within the human diet have distinct delta 13C values, and 
(2) the delta 13C value of human bone collagen is determined by the delta 13C 
value of the diet. Studies of the development of subsistence patterns based on 
corn agriculture, one of the most significant developments in North American 
prehistory, can benefit from the use of stable carbon isotope techniques because 
corn has a high delta 13C value relative to other components of the human diet. 
Measurements of delta 13C of bone collagen from prehistoric human skeletal 
remains from southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas indicate that 
intensive corn agriculture began in this region around A.D. 1000, that the 
incorporation of corn into the human diet was a rapid phenomenon, and that 35 to 
77% of the human diet from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1600 consisted of corn. Results 
from an isochronous population in southeastern South Dakota (A.D. 1400) suggest 
that 78 to 90% of the diet of this group consisted of corn, with no difference 
between males and females. Coupled with more traditional archaeological methods, 
stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen can significantly enhance 
reconstruction of dietary patterns of prehistoric humans."
1912490,"The major phytoalexin in alfalfa is the isoflavonoid (-)-medicarpin (or 6aR, 
11aR)-medicarpin. Isoflavone reductase (IFR), the penultimate enzyme in 
medicarpin biosynthesis, is responsible for introducing one of two chiral 
centers in (-)-medicarpin. We have isolated a 1.18 kb alfalfa cDNA (pIFRalf1) 
which, when expressed in Escherichia coli, converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin 
stereospecifically to (3R)-vestitone, as would be predicted for IFR from 
alfalfa. The calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide (35,400) derived 
from the 954 bp open reading frame compares favorably to estimated Mrs 
determined for IFR proteins purified from other legumes. The transcript (1.4 kb) 
is highly induced in elicited alfalfa cell cultures. The kinetics of induction 
are consistent with the appearance of IFR activity, the accumulation of 
medicarpin, and the observed induction of other enzymes in the pathway. Low 
levels of IFR transcripts were found in healthy plant parts (roots and nodules) 
which accumulate low levels of a medicarpin glucoside. IFR appears to be encoded 
by a single gene in alfalfa. The cloning of IFR opens up the possibility of 
genetic manipulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in alfalfa by altering 
isoflavonoid stereochemistry."
1915513,"We describe an 18-month-old male infant suffering from the ichthyosis 
follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia (IFAP) syndrome and further delineate 
the clinical phenotype. Severe retardation of growth and psychomotor

skin infections and transient nail dystrophy observed in our patient are 
non-obligatory manifestations of this disorder. Histological examination of the 
atrichia revealed poorly developed, shortened hair follicles and a complete 
absence of sebaceous glands. The sex ratio of published cases suggests an 
X-linked recessive inheritance. The marked clinical variability of the IFAP 
syndrome might be the expression of a contiguous gene defect."

this specific group of pre-mRNAs."
1917338,"Deafness and electrocardiographic changes (prolongation of the Q-T interval and 
inversion of the T wave) with a clinical picture of syncopal attacks and sudden

1957. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In this study, 
all the cases reported since 1957 and their proposed prevalence are reviewed. 
The authors describe the 4 cases they have studied, all of which presented 
congenital sensorineural hearing loss and electrocardiographic changes 
characteristic of the syndrome. The relatively high number of cases they have 
encountered casts doubt on literature that states that the syndrome occurs more 
frequently in Northern-European populations. Consequently, it is advisable to 
perform an electrocardiogram in all children affected by congenital deafness."
1919136,"11,119 patients with scarlet fever admitted in the last sixteen years, from 1973 
to 1988, to Sapporo City General Hospital, were studied statistically on 
symptoms and laboratory findings. The results were summarized as follows: 1. 
Annual number of patients have reduced suddenly since 1981, and become zero in 
1989. The patients increased in number during the winter season. Eighty two 
percent of the cases were between 3 and 8 years of age, and the average age was 
5.8 year-old. 2. Cases of above-38 degrees C temperature were seen in about 
81.4%, and from 2 to 5 days-duration of temperature were seen in 86.6% of the 
patients in the year 1976. Cases of above-moderate rash were observed in 68.2%, 
sever redness of throat in 29.9%, strawberry tongue in 86.3% and angular 
stomatitis in 37.7% of the patients. In recent statistical analysis (1982-1988), 
we found, however, a tendency that patients having stronger symptoms were being 
introduced to our hospital. 3. The higher rates of cases showing elevated ASD 
titer were seen in the elder patients and in the winter. C-reactive protein 
(CRP) titers were mostly in the range of (-) to (greater than or equal to 6+), 
having 2.4 + on an average. 4. Patients who developed into overt nephritis were 
not seen. Cases of microscopic hematuria (greater than or equal to 3 red cells/f 
in urine sediments), however, were observed in 1.1% (125/11,119). Sever 
complications were hardly seen. 5. Reappearance of beta-hemolytic streptococci 
(on a week after discharge) were found in 3.1% (241/7,877). 6. Reinfection or 
relapse cases of scarlet fever were found in 6.7% (642/9,585).(ABSTRACT

1920448,"Weak to severe deficit of GATC sequences in the DNA of enterobacteriophages 
appears to be correlated with their undermethylation during growth in dam+ (GATC 
ade-methylase) bacteria. This observation is corroborated by the sequence 
analysis showing no evidence for site-specific mutagenicity of 6meAde. The MutH 
protein of the methyl-directed mismatch repair system recognizes and cleaves the 
undermethylated GATC sequences in the course of mismatch repair. To enquire 
whether the MutH function of the methyl-directed mismatch repair system 
participates in counterselection of GATC sequences in enterobacteriophages, we 
have studied the yield of bacteriophage phi X174 containing either 0, 1, or 2 
GATC sequences, in wild type, dam, and mut (H, L, S, U) Escherichia coli. 
Following transfection with unmethylated DNA containing two GATC sequences, a 
net decrease in the yield of infective particles was observed in all bacterial 
mutH+ dam- strains, whereas no detectable decrease was observed in bacteria 
infected by DNA without GATC sequence. This effect of the MutH function is 
maximum in wild type and mutL and mutS bacteria whereas the effect is not 
significant in mutU bacteria, suggesting an interaction of the helicase II with 
the MutH protein. However, in dam+ bacteria, the presence of GATC sequences 
leads to an increased yield of infective particles. The effect of GATC sequence 
and its Dam methylation system on phage yield in mutH- bacteria reveals that 
methylated GATC sequences are advantageous to the phage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

1920508,"Skin cancers, although uncommon, do occur in black Africans. Available 
literature on this subject from black African populations is scant, suggesting 
diminished interest. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the

analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had 
malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number 
had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body. 
Basal cell carcinomas were found in four (22%) patients with face lesions. Only

1923398,"Clinical characteristics and treatment responses were studied in 130 patients 
with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Most patients were postmenopausal women, and 
the tongue was the most frequently afflicted site. Although 39% of the patients 
complained of dry mouth, no causative factors were evident. Therefore BMS is 
assumed to be a functional disorder. This was at least partially confirmed 
because the most effective management was in response to mood-altering drugs. 
From our data BMS appears to be a chronic condition with variations in symptoms 
among patients and without a predictable endpoint."

1923513,"Arg encodes a protein highly related to the c-abl gene product with regard to 
overall structural architecture as well as the amino acid sequences of their 
tyrosine kinase, and src-homologous 2 and 3 domains. The two genes form a 
distinct subfamily of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and share a common homolog 
in Drosophila. In this study we characterized the arg protein product by 
expression of its coding sequence in bacteria. The recombinant arg protein was 
detected in bacterial lysates by immunoblotting and exhibited a molecular mass 
of 145 kDa. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the arg gene product following an 
immune complex autokinase reaction revealed tyrosine phosphorylation and 
established that it possesses tyrosine kinase activity. High-titer antibody 
capable of detecting the cellular arg gene product was generated by expressing a 
carboxy-terminal segment of arg in bacteria and using the recombinant protein as 
an immunogen. The arg gene product was identified in cultured human cells as a 
145 kDa protein that exhibited autokinase activity. Analysis of arg expression 
in murine tissues revealed that arg, like c-abl, is widely expressed, further 
extending the similarities between the two genes, and suggesting that arg 
probably functions in signaling pathways fundamental to many cell types."
1924367,"We have identified two allelic genomic cosmids from human chromosome 2, c8.1 and 
c29B, each containing two inverted arrays of the vertebrate telomeric repeat in 
a head-to-head arrangement, 5'(TTAGGG)n-(CCCTAA)m3'. Sequences flanking this 
telomeric repeat are characteristic of present-day human pretelomeres. BAL-31 
nuclease experiments with yeast artificial chromosome clones of human telomeres 
and fluorescence in situ hybridization reveal that sequences flanking these 
inverted repeats hybridize both to band 2q13 and to different, but overlapping, 
subsets of human chromosome ends. We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids 
c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the 
point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human 
chromosome 2."
1925023,"HU is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli. Like 
the histones, HU is able to condense DNA in vitro and to introduce negative 
super-coiling in covalently closed circular, relaxed DNA molecules in the 
presence of topoisomerase I. HU is well conserved in all prokaryotes but 
surprisingly, it is also homologous to another E. coli DNA-binding protein, IHF. 
Contrary to HU, IHF shows sequence specificity and is much less abundant that 
HU. Both are heterodimers and all four polypeptide chains probably arose from a 
common ancestor. The question we raised was whether IHF could supply the main 
functions of HU in its absence. The answer seems to be negative for the 
following reasons. We did not observe any significant regulation of expression 
of the genes coding for HU by IHF, or vice-versa. The structures that these two 
proteins form with double-stranded or single-stranded DNA are completely 
different. Finally, overexpression of IHF does not relieve the growth defects 
observed in HU-less mutants. However, it can be speculated from our results that 
even if the two proteins are not equivalent and cannot replace one another, both 
could stimulate (or inhibit) some specific protein-DNA interactions or affect 
the DNA-binding properties of one another."
1966930,"A review of 119 patients (88 males and 31 females) with carcinoma of the lung

1967835,"In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate 
from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion 
satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, 
melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme. We have studied the emergence 
of the Schwann cell lineage in vitro in clonal cultures of quail mesencephalic 
NC cells by using the Schwann cell myelin protein antigen as an early and 
specific marker for myelinating and nonmyelinating cells. After 13-16 days in 
culture, numerous clones contained Schwann cell myelin protein-positive cells, 
sometimes isolated and sometimes associated with other NC-derived cell types. 
Detailed phenotypic analysis of the clones allowed us to infer the presence of 
differently committed Schwann-cell ancestors in the NC during the migration 
stage. In particular, we found evidence for the existence of a bipotent 
precursor of Schwann cells and nonneuronal satellite cells; a common precursor 
of neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells; and a pluripotent precursor of 
Schwann cells, satellite cells, neurons, and melanocytes. These founder cell 
types coexist in the NC with a committed Schwann cell progenitor of 
high-proliferative potential that differentiates in vitro in the absence of 
other peripheral cells and axons."
1968658,"Patterns of DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides and their relations with gene 
expression are complex. Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, 
are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, 
whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these 
sequences. However, in the human carbonic anhydrase (CA) gene family, both the 
ubiquitously expressed CAII and the muscle specific CAIII appear to have such 
CpG islands although erythrocyte-specific CAI does not. The CAII island is 
quantitatively more CpG rich than that of CAIII, with a CpG:GpC ratio of 0.94 
compared with 0.82 for CAIII. Estimation of CpG:GpC ratios in the 
proximal-promoter regions of 44 vertebrate genes suggest that 40% of genes with 
tissue-specific or limited tissue distribution may show methylation-free CpG 
clusters in their promoter regions. In many cases the CpG:GpC ratio is less than 
that found in housekeeping genes and this may reflect variation in the 
interaction of CpG clusters with regulatory factors that define different 
patterns of tissue expression."
1968707,"Profilin is a conserved actin-monomer-binding protein which is found in all 
eukaryotes, including yeast. Although amino acid sequence analysis and RNase 
protection analysis suggest a single profilin isoform in mammalian cells, 
Southern blot analysis of human and somatic cell hybrid DNA indicates several 
loci in the human genome which hybridize with the profilin cDNA. We therefore 
isolated human genomic clones to analyze these genetic loci in detail. Only one 
of the cloned loci has typical features of a functional gene, including upstream 
transcriptional elements and typical exon-intron structure. Four other isolated 
loci are all diverged, intronless pseudogenes and are likely to be 
nonfunctional. The functional gene was localized to human chromosome band 17p13 
by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ chromosomal localization. The 
Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a rare congenital disorder manifested by 
characteristic facial abnormalities and lissencephaly (smooth brain), is 
associated with microdeletions of the distal 17p region. RFLP analysis of a 
patient with MDS, and analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing partially 
deleted chromosomes 17 from patients with MDS, using the profilin gene probe, 
indicate that profilin is localized to chromosome subband 17p13.3. These results 
also indicate that profilin is the first identified cloned gene which is part of 
the genetic material deleted in some patients with MDS but that other patients 
have smaller deletions not affecting the profilin locus. Thus, single allelic 
deletion of the profilin locus may contribute to the clinical phenotype of the 
MDS in some patients but does not play a major role in the essential phenotype."
1969734,"Rats on calcium-deficient diets developed hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism and 
hypertension and showed an increase in plasma catecholamines. Adrenal gland 
catecholamines were decreased while tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine 
beta-hydroxylase (DBH) were found to be increased, as compared to controls. In 
contrast, no significant differences were found between controls and 
parathyroidectomized rats in plasma catecholamines, and catecholamines, TH and 
DBH of the adrenal gland. These findings seem to indicate that the genesis of 
hypertension in rats on a low calcium diet is secondary to hyperparathyroidism 
caused by a low calcium diet. Furthermore, some relation between catecholamines 
and parathyroid hormone seems to exist in the regulation of blood pressure in 
rats."
1973949,"The medical importance, ecology and control of riceland mosquitoes using 
alternative strategies is reviewed. Over 135 pest and vector anopheline and 
culicine mosquito species found in association with riceland habitats and their 
medical importance are presented. Malaria and Japanese encephalitis are the two 
most serious human diseases transmitted by riceland mosquitoes, but they have 
been incriminated as vectors of dozens of arboviruses and other parasites and 
pathogens including the causal agents of West Nile and Rift Valley Fevers and 
lymphatic filariasis. Control of vector and pest mosquitoes using chemical 
pesticides has generated several problems including: insecticide resistance, 
safety risks for humans and domestic animals, and other environmental concerns. 
These problems and the high cost and sustainability of programs based 
predominantly on conventional insecticides have stimulated increased interest in 
integrated control measures in ricelands. The integrated pest management (IPM) 
strategy for mosquito control, also known as integrated vector control (IVC), is 
an ecologically based approach that may involve several complementary 
interventions used in combination or singly. Environmental management, and 
chemical, biological and mechanical control, comprise the elements of IVC 
proposed for use in or near riceland habitats. Some of the elements of 
environmental management include the use of intermittent irrigation; flushing of 
fields; use of rice cultivars that require less water; shifting of planting 
schedules to avoid optimal mosquito breeding conditions; relocation of 
communities or use of dry belt farming around them; and zooprophylaxis and other 
personal protection methods, especially use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets. 
Biological control agents that have been used successfully in rice fields 
include several species of larvivorous fish, a mermithid nematode (Romanomermis 
culicivorax), a fungus (Lagenidium giganteum) and bacteria (Bacillus 
thuringiensis var. israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus). The mermithid and the 
entomopathogens have demonstrated little or no adverse effects on populations of 
vertebrate and invertebrate nontarget organisms. The successful use of any 
particular method or combination of interventions for the control of riceland 
mosquitoes will depend on in-depth ecological studies on the target species and 
nontarget organisms, sound geographic reconnaissance and effective routine 
sampling and evaluation. When biological control agents are considered, 
additional background on the environmental factors limiting their efficacy will 
also be needed. In addition to the technical components of the various 
interventions employed in integrated control, sustained suppression of riceland 
mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit will require a greater sociocultural 
supportive background, particularly in developing countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

1978331,"The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting 
the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content 
and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in 
species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid 
assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These 
code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 
'frozen', but instead it is still evolving."
1979356,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) could improve mean arterial pressure (MAP), 
myocardial contractile parameters (+/- dp/dtmax, Vpm and Vmax) and increase 
plasma epinephrine level significantly at 10 min after TRH administration in 
hemorrhagic shock rabbits, but the action of TRH on MAP and the myocardial 
contractility did not appear in rabbits pre-treated with reserpine (4 mg/kg, 24 
h pre-treatment, i.v.). TRH had no effects on myocardial contractility and MAP 
at 20 and 30 min after administration to rabbits pre-treated with 
beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 h before TRH injection i.v.), 
but it did exert effects on these parameters in rabbits pre-treated with 
alpha-adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine. Experiments in vitro showed that, 
although TRH (10(-4) M/L) had no direct effect on heart, left atrium and aortic 
strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and dopamine on 
the left atrium. These results suggested that antishock effect of TRH is related 
to adrenergic system. TRH stimulates sympathomedullary system to secrete 
epinephrine and sensitize the beta-receptors, but not alpha-receptors. Thus, TRH 
improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output and hemodynamics during 
hemorrhagic shock. The sensitization of the beta- and dopamine receptors played 
an important role in producing direct peripheral actions of TRH."
1979484,"Numerous genes contain regulatory elements located many tens of kilobases away 
from the promoter they control. Specific mechanisms must be required to ensure 
that such distant elements can find and interact with their proper targets but 
not with extraneous genes. This review explores the connections between 
transvection phenomena, the activation of domains of homeotic gene expression, 
position effect variegation and silencers. These various examples of 
long-distance effects suggest that, in all cases, related forms of chromatin 
packaging may be involved."
1983039,"Previous studies have shown that approximately 80% of patients with X-linked 
ichthyosis have a total deletion of the steroid sulphatase (STS) locus which 
lies in Xp22.3-Xpter. We show by Southern analysis that a common core of 
sequences are absent in 78.6% of our cases, suggesting that the deletion 
breakpoints may be highly clustered. To characterize the region in more detail a 
long-range physical map of over 3 megabases (Mb) surrounding the STS locus was 
constructed using pulse-field gel electrophoresis. The map enabled the order of 
sequences tel-SI19-GMGXY3-[STS,GMGXY19]-GMGX9-[dic56 ,SIII2]-cen and the 
localization of the deletion breakpoints to be established. In ten cases the 
pulse-field evidence supports the clustering of breakpoints and indicates a 
deletion size of 2 Mb in most patients. Five CpG islands have been positioned 
around the STS locus and may be associated with other loci in the region 
involved in mental retardation and Kallman's syndrome. The map will be 
instrumental in an attempt to isolate and characterize the deletion breakpoints 
and to access other genes located in the region."
1984490,"Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of 
the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells. Certain lipophilic 
cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken 
up by a variety of carcinomas. Although preferential retention of TPP has been 
demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not 
been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the 
present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different 
cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors 
was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and 
negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the 
normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention 
characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but 
individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III 
glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake 
and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A 
clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound 
dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the 
effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain 
human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic 
compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge. Lipophilic cationic 
compounds may be useful in the intraoperative delineation of tumor margins and 
in the photodynamic therapy of certain nervous system tumors."
1985457,"Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically 
distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) 
and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This hypothesis is derived from two lines of 
evidence. First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of 
chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate 
from different parental chromosomes. In AS, the deletion occurs in the 
maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the 
paternally inherited chromosome 15. The second line of evidence comes from the 
deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients 
without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. These patients have two maternal 
copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of 
one copy from each parent. By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 
specific DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at 
least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular 
deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. Inheritance of one maternal copy and one 
paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal 
uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS 
phenotype in these patients."
1988577,"The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing 
epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced 
breast cancer patients. Patients were stratified according to whether or not 
there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this 
trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall 
response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but 
both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, 
respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in 
FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were 
obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in 
the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. 
Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 
days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients 
without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous 
treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. 
Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other 
groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival 
were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in 
the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 
8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin 
group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in 
survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients, even though 
the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group."
1988766,"Pheochromocytoma is an unusual but potentially devastating tumor. Although a 
high index of suspicion is necessary, the likelihood of a pheochromocytoma is 
lower in the absence of the typical symptoms and findings. Nonetheless, 
screening must be broadened to include patients with a lower risk of the 
disease, such as those with resistant or labile hypertension who are minimally 
symptomatic. Extensive diagnostic evaluations should be reserved for those whose 
clinical or laboratory findings are more suggestive. Symptoms in a group of 
patients in whom a pheochromocytoma was seriously considered but excluded 
overlap symptoms in patients with a pheochromocytoma. Certain symptoms are 
useful: flushing to suggest a non-pheochromocytoma illness; visual symptoms, 
flank pain, and pallor to suggest that a pheochromocytoma is more likely. 
Combinations of symptoms can be of value: 2 or more symptoms from the triad of 
headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis were present in the majority of 
pheochromocytoma patients, but in a smaller number of non-pheochromocytoma 
patients. The presence of the entire triad is more specific, but less sensitive. 
New hypertension, or hypertension associated with unexplained orthostatic 
hypotension, are suggestive of an underlying pheochromocytoma. Twenty-four-hour 
urine studies are consistently abnormal in patients with a pheochromocytoma, but 
are also elevated in a significant proportion of non-pheochromocytoma patients. 
Values greater then 1.5-2-fold above the upper limit of normal are very 
suggestive that a pheochromocytoma is present, and warrant a more intensive 
subsequent evaluation. Imaging studies are reliable in the diagnosis of 
pheochromocytoma, and can help to confirm or exclude the disease. Patients with 
a higher clinical likelihood and any elevated urinary testing, or with a lower 
clinical likelihood and persistently and/or significantly elevated urinary 
testing, should have imaging studies performed. This combination of clinical 
screening, 24-hour urinary testing, and imaging studies is a useful and reliable 
approach to patients suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma."
1992626,"Nonpropulsive esophageal contractions radiologically described as tertiary 
contractions or ""corkscrew"" esophagus suggest the presence of an underlying 
motility disorder and may lead to impaired acid clearance. The goals of this 
study were to determine the prevalence and role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) 
in patients with tertiary contractions. Thirty-five consecutive patients with 
spontaneous, repetitive, nonpropulsive esophageal contractions noted on 
esophagography were studied with endoscopy, infusion esophageal manometry, and 
24-h ambulatory pH monitoring. All patients had esophageal symptoms, mainly 
dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain, but only three were found to have 
esophagitis by endoscopy and biopsy. Nineteen patients had repetitive, 
nonlumen-obliterating, nonperistaltic (tertiary) contractions, six had corkscrew 
esophagus, and 10 had forceful, lumen-obliterating simultaneous contractions 
(rosary bead esophagus). Twenty patients (58%) had GER by pH criteria with mean 
values: % time pH less than 4, 40.9; %upright pH less than 4, 41; %supine pH 
less than 4, 44.3%; number of episodes with greater than 5 min of pH less than 
4, 12. Esophageal motility revealed ""nutcracker"" esophagus in eight, low LESP in 
two, and nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 10. Symptoms or severity of 
nonperistaltic contractions did not correlate with GER. Radiologically 
demonstrable free reflux or the presence of heartburn did not predict GER. We 
conclude that 1) GER occurs in up to 58% of patients with nonpropulsive 
(tertiary) esophageal contractions on esophagography, and may play a role in the 
induction of abnormal peristaltic activity of the esophageal body; 2) GER is 
usually not associated with endoscopic evidence of esophagitis or characteristic 
symptoms, and is recognized by 24-h pH monitoring. We speculate that detection 
and treatment of GER may improve the symptomatic management of patients with 
nonpropulsive esophageal contractions."
1992832,"OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: This paper reviews acute and chronic effects of drugs of 
abuse on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism and their clinical 
significance. The most important source of information for the review is human 
research reports published in refereed journals. A few animal studies, book 
chapters, and abstracts that are especially relevant are also included.
RESULTS: In humans, ethanol in small doses produces cerebral vasodilation; 
higher doses induce cerebral vasoconstriction. Chronic alcoholism is associated 
with reduced CBF and cerebral metabolism. Sedatives and antianxiety drugs lead 
to global reduction in CBF and cerebral metabolism. Caffeine, even in small 
doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor. Cerebral vasodilation is seen 
immediately after cigarette smoking, but chronic smokers show global reduction 
in CBF. Changes in CBF after marijuana smoking are variable; both increases and 
decreases are seen. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. 
Most inhalants and solvents are vasodilators; chronic abuse is accompanied by a 
decrease in CBF. A number of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, amphetamines, 
cocaine, nicotine, and caffeine-phenylpropanolamine combinations, increase the 
risk for stroke. Reduction in CBF associated with chronic use of ethanol, 
nicotine, inhalants, and solvents is at least partially reversible upon 
abstinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Topics for future research include regional brain function, which 
mediates drug-induced mood changes (euphoria); CBF concomitants of psychological 
and physiological characteristics that increase addiction potential; changes in 
CBF that accompany withdrawal syndromes; mechanisms responsible for drug-induced 
stroke; and effects of functional and organic complications on CBF."
1993703,"Several cDNAs encoding H-protein, a constituent of the glycine cleavage system, 
were cloned from chicken liver cDNA libraries with an antibody raised against 
rat H-protein or with a nick-translated cDNA of an immunoreactive clone. The 
structure of the H-protein cDNA consisting of 910 base pairs was determined 
using clones with an apparent overlap in the nucleotide sequence. The cDNA 
encodes the precursor form of H-protein that is comprised of 39 amino acid 
residues for a mitochondrial presequence and 125 amino acid residues for the 
mature protein, following a 5' untranslated region of 13 base pairs. There are 
two genuine consensus sequences for the cleavage/polyadenylation of the 
precursor H-protein mRNA in the 3' untranslated region of the cDNA sequence. We 
showed by comparison with the delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene that only one 
copy of the H-protein cDNA occurs in the haploid genome of the chicken. 
Nevertheless, two types of H-protein mRNAs, which differ by the length of their 
3' untranslated region, are produced in liver. The chicken H-protein gene 
extends over 8 kilobase pairs on the genome and includes 5 exons that encode the 
entire cDNA sequence. Two AATAAA motifs are coded in the last exon of this gene, 
suggesting that the differently size H-protein mRNAs are produced by the 
alternative use of these motifs."
1996802,"Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects 
of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and 
competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic 
synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that 
flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are 
inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. 
Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings 
over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does 
not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine 
overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two 
minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can 
be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. 
Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; 
should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency 
departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could 
be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has 
been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures, 
particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second, 
flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have 
taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed 
successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of 
flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such 
patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term 
endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and 
therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown 
etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because 
flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced 
respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or 
exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in 
the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate 
the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive 
(eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful 
because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly 
distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms 
that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated 
on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of 
this new agent."
1997008,"Tryptophan hydroxylase (L-tryptophan, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase 
[5-hydroxylating]; EC 1.14.16.4; TPH), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in 
the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, was inhibited directly by 
benserazide, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase 
(3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine carboxy-lyase; EC 4.1.1.28; AAAD). Benserazide 
was a competitive inhibitor for the pterin cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin and an 
uncompetitive inhibitor for the substrate tryptophan. NSD 1015, another 
decarboxylase inhibitor, did not directly inhibit TPH. Other compounds with 
catechol moieties in their structures such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), 
dopamine, apomorphine, and SKF 38393 were also found to be potent inhibitors of 
TPH. These results indicate that drugs or neurotransmitters with catechol 
structures directly inhibit the activity of TPH and add to a growing body of 
evidence indicating that endogenous dopamine can exert untoward effects on 
serotonin neurons, including inhibition of TPH. Furthermore, the use of 
decarboxylase inhibitors to cause the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan as an 
in vivo measure of TPH activity could be problematic, particularly when drugs 
with catechol structures or dopamine-releasing compounds are also administered."
2002334,"Studies were conducted to ascertain the temporal and dose-dependent effects of 
nicotinic ligand exposure on functional activity of different nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, as expressed by cells of the PC12 rat 
pheochromocytoma (ganglia-type nAChR) or the TE671/RD human (muscle-type nAChR) 
clonal line. Chronic (3-72-h) agonist (nicotine or carbamylcholine) treatment of 
cells led to a complete (TE671) or nearly complete (PC12) loss of functional 
nAChR responses, which is referred to as ""functional inactivation."" Some 
inactivation of nAChR function was also observed for the nicotinic ligands 
d-tubocurarine (d-TC), mecamylamine, and decamethonium. Half-maximal 
inactivation of nAChR function was observed within 3 min for TE671 cells and 
within 10 min for PC12 cells treated with inactivating ligands. Functional 
inactivation occurred with dose dependencies that could not always be reconciled 
with those obtained for acute agonist activation of nAChR function or for acute 
inhibition of those responses by d-TC, decamethonium, or mecamylamine. Treatment 
of TE671 or PC12 cells with the nicotinic antagonist pancuronium or alcuronium 
alone had no effect on levels of expression of functional nAChRs. However, 
evidence was obtained that either of these antagonists protected TE671 cell 
muscle-type nAChRs or PC12 cell ganglia-type nAChRs from functional inactivation 
on long-term treatment with agonists. Recovery of TE671 cell nAChR function 
following treatment with carbamylcholine, nicotine, or d-TC occurred with 
half-times of 1-3 days whether cells were maintained in situ or harvested and 
replated after removal of ligand. By contrast, 50% recovery of functional nAChRs 
on PC12 cells occurred within 2-6 h after drug removal. In either case the time 
course for recovery from nAChR functional inactivation is much slower than 
recovery from nAChR ""functional desensitization,"" which is a reversible process 
that occurs on shorter-term (0-5-min) agonist exposure of cells. These results 
indicate that ganglia-type and muscle-type nAChRs are similar in their 
sensitivities to functional inactivation by nicotinic ligands but differ in 
their rates of recovery from and onset of those effects. The ability of drugs 
such as the agonists d-TC, decamethonium, and mecamylamine to induce functional 
inactivation may relate to their activities as partial/full agonists, channel 
blockers, and/or allosteric regulators. Effects of drugs such as pancuronium and 
alcuronium are likely to reflect simple competitive inhibition of primary ligand 
binding at functional activation sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2003436,"A blinded, retrospective study was performed to determine the value of supine 
abdominal radiographs in diagnosing pneumoperitoneum. Supine films from 44 cases 
of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 
control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence 
or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on 
both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the 
falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), 
the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the 
right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant). One 
or more of these signs were present in 26 cases (59%) of pneumoperitoneum, 
including the right-upper-quadrant gas sign in 18 cases (41%), Rigler's sign in 
14 cases (32%), and the falciform ligament and football signs in one case each 
(2%). Unfortunately, there were frequent errors in the interpretation of the 
right-upper-quadrant gas sign and Rigler's sign, with a total of 11 
false-positive cases (13%). Further analysis of the true-positive 
right-upper-quadrant gas signs showed that these gas collections were always 
triangular or linear with an inferolateral to superomedial orientation and, if 
triangular, a concave superolateral border. In the true-positive Rigler's signs, 
the bowel wall thickness ranged from 1 to 8 mm, whereas the false positives all 
had a bowel wall thickness of 1 mm or less. Proper interpretation of the various 
signs of pneumoperitoneum on supine films should lead to more accurate diagnosis 
of this condition."
2010914,"Expression of the RNA replicase domain of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and certain 
protein-coding regions in other plant viruses, is mediated by translational 
readthrough of a leaky UAG stop codon. It has been proposed that normal tobacco 
tyrosine tRNAs are able to read the UAG codon of TMV by non-conventional 
base-pairing but recent findings that stop codons can also be bypassed as a 
result of extended translocational shifts (tRNA hopping) have encouraged a 
re-examination. In light of the alternatives, we investigated the sequences 
flanking the leaky UAG codon using an in vivo assay in which bypass of the stop 
codon is coupled to the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) 
reporter genes in tobacco protoplasts. Analysis of GUS constructions in which 
codons flanking the stop were altered allowed definition of the minimal sequence 
required for read through as UAG-CAA-UUA. The effects of all possible 
single-base mutations in the codons flanking the stop indicated that 3' contexts 
of the form CAR-YYA confer leakiness and that the 3' context permits read 
through of UAA and UGA stop codons as well as UAG. Our studies demonstrate a 
major role for the 3' context in the read through process and do not support a 
model in which teh UAG is bypassed exclusively as a result of anticodon-codon 
interactions. No evidence for tRNA hopping was obtained. The 3' context 
apparently represents a unique sequence element that affects translation 
termination."

on IRS-II did not receive XRT, while those on IRS-I were randomized to receive 
VAC +/- XRT. Forty-four of the paraspinal patients (79%) achieved a complete 
response (CR) compared with 77% (1,260 of 1,632) for patients with disease in 
other sites. Twenty-seven patients (55%) subsequently relapsed (five local, 
three regional, four local and distant, and 14 distant). The proportion of 
patients surviving 5 years by clinical group (stage) from I to IV were 50%, 50%, 
62%, and 27%, respectively. Paraspinal patients had somewhat poorer survival 
than patients with disease in other sites, both in IRS-I and IRS-II; the 
percentage of paraspinal patients surviving 5 years was 50% and 52% for IRS-I 
and IRS-II, respectively, whereas these percentages were 55% and 63% for 
patients with disease in other sites. Histology did not influence the CR rate, 
but unexpectedly, patients who had embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) had the 
poorest overall survival rate. We concluded that patients with paraspinal 
lesions may require extended-field radiation therapy to reduce the high local 
failure rate and more intensive chemotherapy to achieve better local and 
systemic tumor control."
2019970,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disease caused by the measles (rubeola) virus and is most often seen in 
children. Many affected children have a history of measles infection in the 
first years of life or exposure to the live measles virus vaccine. Typically, 
there is a rapid onset of neurological symptoms degenerating into a stuporous 
state in the patient. Four children and their families are reviewed. Their 
individual courses, medical and nursing problems and interventions, and 
implications for immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine will 
be discussed."
2023606,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Gaucher's disease, the most prevalent of the 
sphingolipid storage disorders, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 
glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase). Enzyme replacement was proposed as a 
therapeutic strategy for this disorder in 1966. To assess the clinical 
effectiveness of this approach, we infused macrophage-targeted human placental 
glucocerebrosidase (60 IU per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks for 9 to 12 
months) into 12 patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease who had intact spleens. 
The frequency of infusions was increased to once a week in two patients 
(children) during part of the trial because they had clinically aggressive 
disease.
RESULTS: The hemoglobin concentration increased in all 12 patients, and the 
platelet count in 7. Serum acid phosphatase activity decreased in 10 patients 
during the trial, and the plasma glucocerebroside level in 9. Splenic volume 
decreased in all patients after six months of treatment, and hepatic volume in 
five. Early signs of skeletal improvements were seen in three patients. The 
enzyme infusions were well tolerated, and no antibody to the exogenous enzyme 
developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of macrophage-targeted 
glucocerebrosidase produces objective clinical improvement in patients with type 
1 Gaucher's disease. The hematologic and visceral responses to enzyme 
replacement develop more rapidly than the skeletal response."
2028149,"A cerebellar glioblastoma was discovered in a 28 year old woman, 5 years after a 
focal 50 grays brain irradiation for meningioma of the clivus. This case 
fulfilled the accepted criteria for radiation-induced neoplasms of the central 
nervous system, namely a second histologically-proven tumor different from the 
first lesion, a location within the irradiated area and a long latent period."
2029023,"POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic 
myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, 
monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. Presented herein is a case of POEMS 
syndrome with flushing. The flushing was intermittent, involving the face and 
upper third of the trunk, and was associated with hypotension and bronchospasm. 
Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which 
showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for 
lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS 
syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like 
flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other 
clinical features of her disease. This case suggests that idiopathic flushing 
can be added to the skin changes observed in POEMS syndrome."
2030791,"The case is reported of a 47-year old female suffering from the exploding head 
syndrome. This syndrome consists of a sudden awakening due to a loud noise 
shortly after falling asleep, sometimes accompanied by a flash of light. The 
patient is anxious and experiences palpitations and excessive sweating. Most 
patients are more than fifty years of age. Further investigations do not reveal 
any abnormality. The pathogenesis is unknown, and no therapy other than 
reassurance is necessary."
2037280,"Most individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are heterozygous for dominant 
mutations in one of the genes that encode the chains of type I collagen. Each of 
the more than 30 mutations characterized to date has been unique to the affected 
member(s) of the family. We have determined that two individuals with a 
progressive deforming variety of OI, OI type III, have the same new dominant 
mutation [alpha 1(I)gly154 to arg] and that two unrelated infants with perinatal 
lethal OI, OI type II, share a second new dominant mutation [alpha 1(I)gly1003 
to ser]. These mutations occurred at CpG dinucleotides, in a manner consistent 
with deamination of a methylated cytosine residue, and raise the possibility 
that CpG dinucleotides are common sites of recurrent mutations in collagen 
genes. Further, these findings confirm that the OI type-III phenotype, 
previously thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, can result 
from new dominant mutations in the COL1A1 gene of type-I collagen."

2038147,"From January 1981 through December 1989, 15 patients with small advanced lung 
cancer were treated surgically at the Tenri Hospital. In these cases, the 
diameter of peripheral lung cancer did not exceed 3.0 cm (T1) and mediastinal 
lymph nodes were proved to be N2 postoperatively by lymph node dissection or 
sampling. The histological types were as follows: 8 adenocarcinoma, 4 large cell 
carcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 small cell carcinoma, and 1 
adenosquamous carcinoma. All but one patient were received postoperative 
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The survival rate was 44.5% at 3 years, and 
median survival time was 36 months. The mediastinal lymph node metastasis with 
small peripheral lung cancer (T1N2) was ominous, and it should be said that 
complete mediastinal lymph node dissection and adjuvant therapy were 
indispensable to small advanced adenocarcinoma of lung."
2039657,"This review deals with the comparative observations of brown fat tissue in the 
bat, a hibernator, and in man, a nonhibernator. In both mammals, the brown fat 
is distributed in restricted portions of the body and brought into a 
thermogenetic activity by an acute drop in ambient temperature. Light 
microscopic examination was performed on the interscapular brown fat of bats 
captured monthly throughout one year; electron microscopic observations were 
made using a bat captured in April and another in September. Human perirenal 
brown fat was investigated light-microscopically on tissues derived from 215 
fresh necropsy cases (Japanese) of both sexes aged from one month to 93 years. 
Brown adipose tissue was recognized only in 162 (75%) of the 215 samples, 
because brown fat cells were reduced by transformation into white fat cells. 
Human brown fat cells were classified into six types according to the 
morphological features of their lipid droplets. These reflect different 
functional states of intracellular heat production. The Type 1 (D) cell is a 
fat-depleted brown fat cell with a darkly stained cytoplasm; it is specific to 
humans. Human perirenal brown fat cells begin to show a transformation into 
white fat cells already at the infantile stage. This change occurs from the 
peripheral toward the central portion of the lobule, so that various functioning 
cell types remain only in the central area of the lobules. In contrast to 
humans, bat interscapular brown fat cells exhibit regular seasonal changes in 
size and lipid droplet content, so that the cells could not be classified as in 
humans into definite types according to the features of their lipid droplets. 
The most conspicuous difference between brown fat tissue in the nonhibernator 
and hibernator is that in the latter, white fat cells never occur within the 
brown fat tissue. In the hibernator, thermogenesis in the brown fat is necessary 
for both the arousal from hibernation and the maintenance of hibernation as well 
as rutting. In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted 
cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the 
reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. The ""hypothermic"" or 
""cold syndrome (cold injury)"" is a disorder affecting inadequately protected 
infants in severely cold seasons, accompanied by lethargy, hypothermia and 
lactation refusal and revealing hemorrhagic pneumonia in necropsy. The brown fat 
tissue in such infants is composed exclusively of fat-depleted brown fat 
cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2040696,"In addition to local sequence elements the regulation of the high-level, 
development- and tissue-specific expression of the human beta globin gene 
cluster appears to require distant regulatory sequences which have been termed 
locus control region. In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control 
region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 
6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The definition of the sequences minimally 
required for locus control region activity is likely to further the 
understanding of its physiology and will be of interest for the development of 
somatic gene therapy strategies of the hemoglobinopathies. We present here the 
analysis of a family with a 3,030-bp deletion of sequences upstream of the 
epsilon globin gene including the most 3' locus control region element and 
cosegregating beta(0) thalassemia. The deletion is linked in cis to a 
structurally and functionally normal beta globin gene. The proximal element of 
the locus control region does not therefore appear to be necessary for beta 
globin gene activity in vivo."

rash in the 10- to 30-year-old age group. Despite its prevalence, many emergency 
and primary care physicians may not be aware of the pathogenic potential of this 
organism. We present a case that illustrates the distinctive clinical spectrum 
of A. hemolyticum infections that may be confused with drug allergy, group A 
streptococcal scarlet fever, diphtheria, and even toxic shock syndrome. 
Recognition of this syndrome will reduce misdiagnoses and facilitate appropriate 
treatment."
2048769,"There is agreement about the influence of the genetic apolipoprotein (apo E) 
polymorphism on plasma lipid and apoprotein levels in man. Whereas the 
association of the apo E2 isoform with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and 
hyperlipoproteinemia type III is well established, the plasma- and 
LDL-cholesterol lowering effects of apo E2 and the phenomenon of apo E4 raising 
these parameters on the development of coronary heart disease is still a matter 
of controversial discussion. Despite these uncertainties the knowledge of an 
individual's apo E phenotype may provide additional information in future to 
judge its risk to develop atherosclerosis. From a variety of methods meanwhile 
described to analyze the polymorphism and evaluate the apo E phenotype the 
author has modified three procedures to apply to different questions concerning 
apo E isoform analysis. They concern the visualization of the apo E pattern in 
diluted solutions and those containing high salt concentrations, the apo E 
phenotyping on a large scale basis from whole plasma avoiding a possible 
misinterpretation by a thrombin fragment of apo E and finally the search for new 
apo E variants with a high resolution system on immobilized pH gradient gels."
2050307,"Although carcinosarcoma occurs in various locations throughout the body, it 
rarely originates in the ovary. Chemotherapy has been minimally beneficial. This 
case describes a patient with carcinosarcoma of the ovary who responded 
minimally to chemotherapy used for epithelial carcinomas but had a complete 
response after receiving chemotherapy used for sarcomas. The patient relapsed 
within 1 year after receiving cisplatin therapy. She was treated with mesna, 
ifosfamide, Adriamycin, and dacarbazine (MAID) chemotherapy and after one cycle 
of chemotherapy she had no evidence of tumor. She has received six cycles of 
chemotherapy without evidence of progression 13+ months since beginning MAID 
therapy. MAID chemotherapy may be useful in the treatment of carcinosarcoma of 
the ovary."
2052626,"The sphincter of Oddi is a small sphincter which is strategically placed at the 
junction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct with the duodenum. It regulates 
the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum and prevents reflux of 
duodenal contents into the ducts. The structure of the sphincter of Oddi differs 
from species to species and consequently its physiological action varies in 
different species. Anatomical and immunohistochemical investigations have 
demonstrated that the sphincter of Oddi is richly innervated by cholinergic, 
adrenergic and peptidergic neurons. In addition, neural connections exist 
between the sphincter, gallbladder and proximal gastrointestinal tract. These 
nerves in addition to hormones are important in the control of sphincter of Oddi 
motility and function. The normal human sphincter of Oddi is characterized by 
prominent phasic contractions which are superimposed on a modest basal pressure. 
These contractions are present throughout the interdigestive period. The 
contractions and basal pressure are inhibited by ingestion of a meal or infusion 
of cholecystokinin octapeptide, thus enhancing the flow of bile and pancreatic 
juice into the duodenum. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction has been described in 
patients who present with recurrent biliary type pain and no evidence of a 
structural cause for the pain. Motility disorders characterized as an elevated 
basal pressure, rapid contraction frequency, paradoxical response to 
cholecystokinin octapeptide or excess of retrograde contractions have been 
identified. A number of pharmacologically active substances have been used in an 
attempt to treat these patients. Such pharmaceuticals include nitrites, Ca2+ 
channel blockers and smooth muscle relaxants. Their effect is transient and side 
effects relating to cardiovascular actions preclude their longterm use. Division 
of the sphincter either endoscopically or by open operation has been 
demonstrated by prospective clinical trials to be the most efficacious treatment 
for patients with a stenosed sphincter manometrically demonstrated by a high 
basal pressure. Improved understanding of the controlling mechanisms of 
sphincter of Oddi motility and the pathophysiology of sphincter of Oddi 
dysfunction should assist in the development of effective pharmacotherapy for 
these disorders."

medium-, or short-term memory in these patients."
2102235,"In 1877, Dr Heinrich Koebner inflicted an experimental trauma on the uninvolved 
skin of a psoriatic patient. This resulted in the appearance of a typical 
psoriatic lesion at the site of trauma. This reaction, known as Koebner's 
phenomenon (KP), has subsequently been associated with several skin diseases. 
However, it has not been associated previously with necrobiosis lipoidica 
diabeticorum (NBL), a rare skin manifestation of diabetes mellitus. This report 
presents the unusual finding of NBL associated with KP in a patient with 
diabetes mellitus."
2102396,"Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice 
gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of 
teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal 
part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become 
hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in 
comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and 
medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with 
spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17. They give some 
arguments to discuss several features of normal early development of this area."
2103444,"Plant RNA viruses commonly exploit leaky translation termination signals in 
order to express internal protein coding regions. As a first step to elucidate 
the mechanism(s) by which ribosomes bypass leaky stop codons in vivo, we have 
devised a system in which readthrough is coupled to the transient expression of 
beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in tobacco protoplasts. GUS vectors that contain the 
stop codons and surrounding nucleotides from the readthrough regions of several 
different RNA viruses were constructed and the plasmids were tested for the 
ability to direct transient GUS expression. These studies indicated that 
ribosomes bypass the leaky termination sites at efficiencies ranging from 
essentially 0 to ca. 5% depending upon the viral sequence. The results suggest 
that the efficiency of readthrough is determined by the sequence surrounding the 
stop codon. We describe improved GUS expression vectors and optimized 
transfection conditions which made it possible to assay low-level translational 
events."
2105461,"A mutant of Bacillus subtilis defective in the constitutive activity of 
O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase was isolated from a strain (ada-1) 
deficient in the adaptive response to DNA alkylation. Cells carrying the 
mutation dat-1 which was responsible for the defect in constitutive activity 
exhibited hypersensitivity for lethality and mutagenesis when challenged with 
methyl-nitroso compounds. The constitutive activity is independent of the 
adaptive response, and seems to function as a basal defense against 
environmental alkylating agents."
2107174,"PIP: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a syndrome that occurs mainly 
in adults with multiorgan microvascular thrombosis consisting of 
thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal 
involvement, and fever. The female to male ratio is 3:2, and peak incidence 
occurs in the 3rd decade of life. Clinical signs are the consequence of hyaline 
thrombosis and occlusion of capillaries and arterioles. Renal ailment manifests 
itself in hematuria and proteinuria with azotemia and even overt renal failure. 
In severe disease, azotemia is typical of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TTP 
was first described in 1925 by Moschcowitz. The clinical picture of TTP consists 
of a prodromal phase, a viruslike disease occurring in up to 40% of patients. 
60% have neurologic disturbances, 90% have purpura initially, and fever occurs 
in all. Anemia is often severe with hemoglobin values of 7-9 gm/dl, renal 
involvement in 90%, and renal failure in 40-80% of patients. Clinical variants 
include the acute and fulminant variety mortality, the chronic form, and the 
relapsing form. Predisposing factors and triggering agents are autosomal 
recessive inherited traits in acute idiopathic TTP, systemic diseases, tumor 
antigens, pregnancy and puerperium, viruses (endotoxins for HUS), and possibly 
oral contraceptives and hypertension. Therapy includes corticosteroids 
(prednisone 100-400 mg/day); heparin for postpartum HUS; and antiplatelet agents 
(Dextran 70, aspirin, and dipyridamole in high doses). The infusion of PGI2 is 
controversial; splenectomy is also questionable; and vincristine, azathioprine, 
and cyclophosphamide have unproven efficacy. Fresh-frozen plasma exchange is the 
method of choice as it produces survival in 90%. Others are iv immunoglobulins, 
vitamin E, and dialysis and renal transplant. Platelet transfusions are 
contraindicated because of sudden death and decreased survival."
2107926,"OBJECTIVE: To see whether combined treatment with oral tacrine 
(tetrahydroaminoacridine; THA) and lecithin improves the symptoms of patients 
with Alzheimer's disease.
DESIGN: Multicentre double blind, placebo controlled, random order crossover 
trial with individual determination of maximum tolerated dosage and four month 
follow up.
SETTING: Outpatient departments at six university neurological centres.
PATIENTS: 67 Outpatients (24 men, 43 women) aged 53-81 (mean 66 (SD 7.3)) 
selected according to the following criteria: probable Alzheimer's disease as 
defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders 
and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association; 
absence of mood disorder; mini mental state score lower than 26; availability of 
a close relative able to complete questionnaires; and informed consent of the 
patient or his or her closest relative, or both.
INTERVENTIONS: Mean of 114 mg tacrine or placebo daily plus 1200 mg lecithin 
daily given in three divided doses for one four week active treatment period and 
one four week control period without washout at crossover.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive state as assessed by Folstein's mini mental 
state rating scale, behavioural state as assessed by the Stockton geriatric 
rating scale, and overall state as assessed with a visual analogue scale rated 
by both the relative and the physician.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo tacrine did not improve either the mini mental 
state score (mean 14.9 (SD 7.3) v 14.8 (7.3)) or the Stockton geriatric score 
(28.2 (15.7) v 28.7 (17.8)), but a slight and statistically significant 
improvement occurred in the physician's score on the visual analogue scale (6.3 
(10.2) v 11.6 (17.9)). Seven patients dropped out. Six patients were excluded 
because of acute hepatitis and one withdrew for personal reasons not related to 
treatment. Two other patients developed acute hepatitis at the end of the eight 
week crossover trial and another during the follow up study. Twenty patients 
complained of gastrointestinal side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither short term nor long term treatment with oral tacrine at 
dosages lower than 125 mg/day improves the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. 
Moreover, these dosages may induce hepatitis (nine of 67 patients in this 
series)."
2108845,"Serum phosphorus levels (Ps), dietary intake of phosphorus, and renal phosphate 
handling indexes were evaluated in 158 patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) of varying degrees of severity; moreover, skeletal 
muscle phosphorus content (Pm) was measured in muscle samples obtained by 
quadriceps femoris needle biopsy in 14 of the same patients. Hypophosphatemia 
(Ps less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl) was found in 34 (21.5 percent) of 158 
patients without differences between groups of COPD patients presenting 
increasing severity of respiratory illness. No relationship was found between 
serum levels and dietary intake of phosphorus; hypophosphatemia was associated 
with low renal phosphate threshold (TmPO4/GFR) values in 31 (91 percent) of 34 
patients. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia was significantly higher among COPD 
patients taking one or more drugs commonly used in COPD and known as negatively 
influencing renal phosphate handling: xanthine derivatives, corticosteroids, 
loop diuretics, and beta 2-adrenergic bronchodilators. Short-term administration 
of therapeutic doses of these drugs in COPD patients previously not taking any 
drug reduced TmPO4/GFR values; phosphaturic effect of short-term theophylline 
administration on renal phosphate handling was additive to that of long-term 
assumption of the drug. Muscle phosphorus content was both reduced in COPD 
patients as compared with control subjects and significantly correlated to serum 
phosphorus levels and to TmPO4/GFR values. The present investigation revealed a 
high prevalence of hypophosphatemia among COPD patients as well as a defect in 
renal phosphate reabsorption secondary, at least in part, to pharmacologic 
therapy. Moreover, it also suggests that in COPD patients muscle phosphorus 
content is likely to be reduced in presence of hypophosphatemia."
2110385,"The mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine regimen produced a 47% response 
rate (including 10% complete responses) in 105 eligible adults with advanced 
sarcoma. The major dose-limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia. There was one 
toxic death from sepsis. Central nervous system and renal toxicity occurred 
infrequently, perhaps as a result of the continuous-infusion schedule. This 
regimen is being evaluated further in advanced disease, the adjuvant setting, 
and in combination with bone marrow colony-stimulating factors."
2112565,"Patients suffering from severe cranio-cerebral trauma show alterations of the 
secretory patterns of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and human growth hormone 
(HGH) which may be of prognostic significance. We studied 10 patients following 
severe brain injury and prospectively compared a new synthetic human growth 
hormone releasing factor (HGHRF) test with the thyrotropin releasing hormone 
(TRH) test. On admission, all patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 or 4. 
All patients had a low T3 syndrome. In the patients who died the TSH response 
after stimulation with TRH was also absent. In the patients who survived a 
significant TSH increase was observed (p less than 0.05). In comparison to the 
patients who died those who survived showed a significant (p less than 0.001) 
HGH increase after HGHRF stimulation. This test might be useful as an additional 
tool in establishing early prognosis in patients with severe brain injury."
2112988,"A female child of healthy, unrelated parents presented at 12 months of age with 
a history of moderately severe developmental delay, macrocephaly, dysmorphic 
facies, hypotonia, hepatosplenomegaly, mild generalized dysostosis multiplex, 
mucopolysacchariduria (dermatan and heparan sulfates), and Alder-Reilly bodies 
in peripheral blood leukocytes. Iduronate sulfatase activity in plasma was 
markedly depressed: 0.11 units/ml/h (normal, 1.75 +/- 0.56, N = 6). Analyses of 
arylsulfatases A, B, and C, heparan N-sulfatase, alpha-mannosidase, 
beta-mannosidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-hexosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, 
and alpha-fucosidase activities in plasma, leukocytes, and/or cultured skin 
fibroblasts were all normal. Urinary sulfatide excretion was also within normal 
limits. Karyotypes of peripheral blood leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts 
were normal. Serum iduronate sulfatase activities in the parents were in the 
normal range (father, 1.63 units/ml/h; mother, 1.25 units/ml/h). The results of 
analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of DNA from 
cultured skin fibroblasts with the use of probes for loci extending from Xpter 
to Xq28 showed X chromosome heterozygosity and confirmed the paternal origin of 
one of the X chromosomes. Studies on sulfur-35 uptake in mixed fibroblast 
cultures showed cross-correction of [35S]-glycosaminoglycan accumulation between 
cells from the patient and normal cells or cells from a patient with Hurler 
disease; however, there was no cross-correction between cells from the patient 
and those from boys affected with classical Hunter disease. This represents only 
the second confirmed case of Hunter disease reported in a karyotypically normal 
girl."
2113543,"In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the 
efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients 
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with 
benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was 
given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased 
significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, 
including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of 
injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 
within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, 
needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise 
significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine 
sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients 
receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS 
from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up 
to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes 
in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected 
within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no 
adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that 
flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine 
overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug 
intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for 
reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications."
2115017,"The action of toxins A, B, and C from Clostridium difficile was studied in the 
small intestine and colon of rats. All three caused fluid accumulation in the 
small intestine, maximal secretion being induced by 1 micrograms of toxin A, 20 
micrograms of B, and 15 micrograms of C. Both toxins A and C caused shedding of 
epithelial cells from the villi without visible damage to crypt cells; toxin A 
caused further extensive necrosis and bleeding. Toxin B caused secretion without 
visible damage to the epithelial cells, though this activity was unstable and 
decreased significantly after one week of storage. In the colon, toxin A caused 
secretion and shedding of surface epithelial cells without damage to crypt 
cells, toxin C caused only a weak secretion, and toxin B had no effect at all. 
In terms of immunohistochemistry, it was found that toxin A bound to the 
enterocytes at the tips of the villi but not to goblet and crypt cells. The 
complex expression or interaction of the toxins produced by Cl difficile may 
explain the broad spectrum of disease (diarrhoea, colitis, and pseudomembranous 
colitis) associated with this micro-organism."

seizures for over two years. First seizures occurred between 18 months and 4 
years, and they were generalized clonic, tonic-clonic or tonic. After a mean 3 
months' period, patients started also to have absence and myoclonic fits. During 
the period with various types of seizures, that lasted a mean 10 months, 
patients were ataxic and hyperkinetic, and 11 of them suffered myoclonic absence 
status for several hours or days. The EEG showed a high voltage rhythmic 
slow-wave activity with spikes, differing from the slow spike wave tracing of 
the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and there was no photosensitivity. The mean 
duration of the epilepsy was 1 year and 4 months and the last seizures were 
convulsive, occurring mainly during sleep. The clinical and EEG pattern, the 
high familial incidence are shared by the Doose syndrome, of which the present 
series seems to be a subgroup, as are other well-defined syndromes: benign and 
severe myoclonic epilepsies of infancy."
2117086,"A female infant with early-onset GM1-gangliosidosis type I was investigated. The 
lymphocytes, transformed lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts of the 
patient were demonstrated to have severe beta-D-galactosidase deficiency. The 
beta-D-galactosidase activities of these cells from the patient's father and 
mother were at the lower limit of the normal range. The oligosaccharide 
accumulation in urine of the patient showed the typical type I 
GM1-gangliosidosis pattern, but no GM1 ganglioside was detected in the patient's 
urine or transformed lymphocytes. The clinical features were compatible with 
infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. The mixture of homogenates from the cultured 
fibroblasts or transformed lymphocytes of the patient and controls showed no 
complementation of beta-D-galactosidase activity against the controls."
2117855,"Seven members of an Ashkenazi Jewish family with Gaucher disease in 3 successive 
generations were tested for the presence of the 2 common mutations known to 
occur in the glucocerebrosidase gene. Genomic DNA from blood or skin fibroblasts 
of relatives was amplified by using the PCR technique and individual mutations 
identified by oligonucleotides specific to the mutated sequences. Four 
individuals were homozygous for a mutation at amino acid 370 (370 mutation) 
known to occur only in type 1 disease. The other 3 affected relatives were 
compound heterozygotes for this mutation and for a mutation at amino acid 444 
(NciI mutation) which, in the homozygous state, is associated with neurological 
disease. Clinical severity was more marked in the compound heterozygotes than in 
the homozygotes. Since the mutation is present in Ashkenazim, molecular 
diagnosis in families which carry the NciI mutation should prove useful in 
assessing their risk of the neurologic forms of Gaucher disease."

2123760,"GM1-gangliosidosis is a rare neurovisceral storage disease caused by an 
inherited deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase. The characteristic neurological 
feature of type 3 (adult or chronic) GM1-gangliosidosis is usually a slowly 
progressive dystonia with dysarthria due to predominant involvement of basal 
ganglia. About 20 adult patients with this disorder have been reported in the 
literature. However, there are no reports of 3 brothers with type 3 
GM1-gangliosidosis, and MRI findings. Case 1 (proband): A 28-year-old man was 
hospitalized because of facial grimace, dysarthria, and generalized dystonia. He 
was born after normal pregnancy and delivery. His development was normal until 3 
years of age when the difficulties of speaking and walking were noticed by his 
parents. These neurological abnormalities progressed slowly and facial grimace 
and dystonic movements occurred 7 years later. He could not walk at 22 years of 
age. On admission, he was bedridden with marked scoliosis and subluxation of the 
mandibule. The communication was possible only by pointing the words written on 
the board. Case 2: A 33-year-old man, elder brother of case 1, showed the 
similar neurological features and clinical course. Slit-lamp examination 
revealed corneal opacities which were located in the deep stroma. Case 3: A 
33-year-old man, elder brother of case 1 or case 2. At age 10-11, he noted 
similar symptoms as case 1 or case 2. The severity of dystonia was milder than 
his brothers. A diagnosis of GM1-gangliosidosis in three patients was made on 
the basis of the following data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2125610,"In six patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis we evaluated 
changes of T4, T3, TSH, PRL, and GH during treatment by continuous iv infusion 
of TRH for at least 15 days. No clinical improvement was detected. A significant 
rise of thyroid hormone levels was observed, as well as an upward trend of basal 
TSH levels and no change of basal PRL and GH levels. TRH acute test-induced TSH 
and PRL responses became blunted. Treatment provoked also the onset of a 
responsiveness of PRL to GHRH. The reduced TSH and PRL responses to acute TRH 
test during treatment could be explained by a down-regulation of TRH pituitary 
receptors. On the contrary, the onset of PRL responsiveness to GHRH is at 
present without a satisfactory explanation."
2126554,"Ten consecutive patients with motor neuron disease (MND) who had bulbar symptoms 
received one or two intravenous doses followed by increasing oral doses of a TRH 
analogue (RX77368). Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and 
jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight 
patients respectively. The initial time course of improvement correlated with 
increasing plasma levels of the drug, but most clinical effects persisted when 
the levels decreased and became undetectable after 24 hours. The oral solution 
was tasteless and had no, or minimal, side effects."
2127684,"Pharmacological interest in the tripeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) 
is due to the multiple effects it produces. In fact, apart from taking part in 
regulating the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis, TRH produces 
various neuropharmacological effects which indicate a biological role that is 
probably more important than that of a releasing hormone. Trials performed in 
animals have shown, for example, the dose-dependent capacity of TRH to induce 
analgesia, probably by interacting with the opioid peptide system. Motor 
activity is affected by TRH. In fact this tripeptide elicits an increase in 
spontaneous motor and explorative activities by interacting with the 
dopaminergic neurotransmitter system at the nucleus accumbens level. The 
neuropharmacological activities of TRH include an interesting arousal effect and 
an analeptic action on generalized depression of the CNS whether this depression 
is of natural origin, such as hibernation, or induced pharmacologically 
(barbiturates, ethanol) or of a traumatic origin (coma). This analeptic action 
is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal 
area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and 
TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of 
Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a 
part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the 
arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions 
are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, 
circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the 
CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of 
coma due to brain trauma and for the treatment of endogenous depression. A most 
interesting property of TRH is that of counteracting the neurological deficit 
due to experimental lesion of the spinal cord particularly with regard to 
spasticity and ataxia. Electrophysiological trials have shown that TRH 
depolarizes the motoneurons in frog spinal cord thereby increasing the 
monosynaptic reflex. Furthermore, TRH has recently been shown to have a trophic 
effect on cultures of rat fetus spinal cord. On this basis TRH has been used 
successfully for the treatment of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (Charcot's 
syndrome) and spinocerebellar degeneration. Further support for this therapeutic 
strategy is given by the demonstration that deafferentiation of rat spinal cord 
produces an increased density of TRH spinal receptors. Recent studies have also 
given encouraging results on the possible therapeutic use of TRH for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2127925,"13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were treated with 
intravenous infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). In 6 patients 2 
mg/day of TRH was i.v. given over 2 hours for 10 days. In 7 others 2 mg/day of 
TRH was continuously infused by means of a pump. An increase of thyroid hormones 
related to the duration of the treatment was observed. A surprising finding was 
the onset of prolactin (PRL) response to growth hormone releasing hormone 
(GHRH), previously absent."
2129297,"The locus for the gene causing neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was bracketed to a 
region on the long arm of chromosome 17 by means of genetic linkage analysis. 
When the limits of resolution for genetic mapping were reached physical mapping 
methods were used to map the NF1 gene precisely, with reference to translocation 
breakpoints in NF1 affected individuals who harboured constitutional chromosomal 
translocations on chromosome 17. The region of DNA located between two 
translocation breakpoints has been cloned and a DNA sequence encoding a 11-13 kb 
mRNA identified. That this sequence shows deletions and point mutations in NF1 
affected individuals and not in normal controls provides strong evidence that it 
is indeed the NF1 gene. The genetic defect in NF2 has been mapped to chromosome 
22 by studies of chromosomal loss in tumours associated with this disease. 
Subsequent linkage analysis of NF2 pedigrees has confirmed this location. DNA 
markers that bracket the NF2 locus to a region of 5-10 Mb have been identified."
2129545,"Titin is the largest polypeptide yet described (relative molecular mass 
approximately 3 x 10(6); refs 1, 2) and an abundant protein of striated muscle. 
Its molecules are string-like and in vivo span from the M to Z-lines. I-band 
regions of titin are thought to make elastic connections between the thick 
filament and the Z-line, thereby forming a third type of sarcomere filament. 
These would centre the A-band in the sarcomere and provide structural continuity 
in relaxed myofibrils. The A-band region of titin seems to be bound to the thick 
filament, where it has been proposed to act as a 'molecular ruler' regulating 
filament length and assembly. Here, we show that partial titin complementary 
DNAs encode a regular pattern of two types of 100-residue motif, each of which 
probably folds into a separate domain type. Such motifs are present in several 
evolutionarily divergent muscle proteins, all of which are likely to interact 
with myosin. One or both of the domain types is therefore likely to bind to 
myosin."
2130777,"A rare case of syringomyelia associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation, primary 
IgA deficiency and sex chromosomal abnormality is reported. A 26-year-old 
Ethiopian black male was admitted with a complaint of hypalagesia of his left 
arm and face for 10 years. Neurological examination on admission revealed 
dissociated sensory loss of his left arm and face. Mild motor weakness of his 
hand and rotatory nystagmus on left gaze were also noticed. Plain craniogram of 
lateral view showed small posterior cranial fossa with low positioned inion and 
platybasia. MRI with T1-weighted images in sagittal plane revealed tonsillar 
herniation reaching C1 and syrinx extending from C2 to lumbar region. Although 
no episode of infectious disease nor allergy were experienced, blood analysis 
disclosed low serum level of IgA (7 mg/dl). The values of other immunoglobulins 
were within normal range. IgA in saliva was not detected, too. According to the 
clinical history and symptoms, a diagnosis is of primary asymptomatic IgA 
deficiency was obtained. Karyotype analysis showed inversion of Y chromosome. In 
an attempt to avoid anaphylactic shock on blood transfusion in a patient with 
IgA deficiency, autologous blood was prepared before surgery. Decompressive 
craniectomy of the posterior fossa with posterior arch of C1 and C2 was 
performed together with syringosubarachnoid shunt at Th 6-7 level. Postoperative 
course was successful and slight improvement of sensory disturbance was 
obtained. No respiratory or wound infection was occurred. The association of 
these three anomalies is very rare and genetical relationship is not known. From 
surgical point of view, it is conceivable that preoperative management in a case 
of asymptomatic IgA deficiency is uneventful."

stimulation. The TSH test was repeated after 4-weeks TRH treatment. The results 
were compared with the data obtained in the control group. It was shown that 
after TRH stimulation the TSH responses did not reveal greater abnormalities, 
but PRL responses were significantly diminished. The results could confirm our 
previous observations concerning the dysregulation of dopamine metabolism in ALS 
patients."
2135382,"Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of unknown 
pathogenesis. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against 
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, 
epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. GAD is an enzyme selectively 
concentrated in neurons secreting the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) and in pancreatic beta cells. We subsequently observed autoantibodies to 
GABA-ergic neurons in 20 of 33 patients with stiff-man syndrome. GAD was the 
principal autoantigen. In the group of patients positive for autoantibodies 
against GABA-ergic neurons, there was a striking association with organ-specific 
autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These 
findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease 
and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome 
and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our findings also 
indicate that autoantibodies directed against GABA-ergic neurons are a useful 
marker in the diagnosis of the disease."
2137344,"Treatment with the new calcium antagonist isradipine significantly reduced 
diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 64% of fourteen blacks with 
mild or moderately severe essential hypertension. There was a significant 
reduction in the echocardiographic measures of left ventricular wall thickness 
and mass in these patients. There was also an increase in fractional left 
ventricular mass index, shortening and ejection fraction per 100 g left 
ventricular mass and no indication in mean circumferential shortening. There was 
another indication of improved left ventricular performance. With the reduced 
left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the 
ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left 
ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic 
wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The 
directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine 
indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left 
ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on 
isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those 
treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These 
changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left 
ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in 
electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with 
diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy 
was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension, 
resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and 
augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass."
2137438,"We have analyzed 60 cases of intra-axial brain tumors associated with antecedent

treatment of benign disease (mostly cutaneous infections). The number of cases 
reported during the past decade has greatly increased as compared to previous 
years. Forty-six of the 60 intra-axial tumors have been reported since 1978. The 
relative risk of induction of an intra-axial brain tumor by radiation therapy is

2139701,"Twenty-five patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with a therapeutic 
vaccine (""theraccine"") consisting of allogeneic melanoma lysates and a novel 
adjuvant, DETOX (Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc, Hamilton, MT). Each patient 
received 200 antigenic units (20 x 10(6) tumor cell equivalents) subcutaneously 
on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Clinical responses included one complete remission, 
three partial remissions, and a long-term (17-month) stability. Two other 
patients had mixed responses, with partial remissions of numerous subcutaneous 
nodules. Sites of responsive disease included primarily the skin, but ileal, 
breast, and a liver metastasis also responded. Removal of residual lesions in 
patients with partial remissions, whose other lesions had disappeared during 
treatment, led to long disease-free survivals. The median duration of remission 
was 17 months, with four of the five responders alive for at least 24 months 
after treatment. An increase in precursors of cytolytic T cells (CTLs) 
correlated with clinical outcome, when complete, partial, and mixed responses 
and long-term stability were considered. The CTLs recognized melanoma-associated 
antigens on many cell lines, but not other types of tumor or normal lymphocytes. 
Skin-test reactivity to melanoma antigens and serum antibodies against the 
melanoma cells was unrelated to clinical response. Toxicity was minimal, 
restricted largely to minor soreness at the site of injection. Only five 
patients, four of whom were treated with repeated courses, developed severe 
granulomas. These results confirm that active-specific immunization with 
allogeneic lysates of melanoma administered with the adjuvant DETOX can induce 
immunity to melanoma, and can induce regressions of disease in a proportion of 
patients with metastatic disease with little toxicity."
2142022,"Age-associated slowing of cardiac relaxation related to the decline in the Ca2+ 
pump function of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has been previously 
described. It is unclear if the decreased Ca2+ pump function results from a 
lower amount of Ca2(+)-ATPase protein or a decreased pumping activity of the 
enzyme. To determine if these alterations could be mediated by changes in the 
amount of the protein itself, the level of the messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for 
the Ca2(+)-ATPase of the SR of Fischer rat hearts (4- and 30-month-old rats) 
were quantitated with a Northern blotting technique. We observed that the levels 
of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA were 60% lower in old rats as compared with young rats, 
suggesting that a quantitative reduction in the levels of the corresponding 
protein could occur during aging to explain the delayed diastolic relaxation 
documented in old animals as opposed to a change in the specific activity of 
this enzyme. The thyroid hormone responsiveness of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA has 
been previously established. We have found in this study that the thyroxine 
levels were consistently lower in old rats; however, this difference was 
relatively small (4.3 +/- 0.7 and 3.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl [mean +/- SD), 
respectively, in young and old rats). In addition, no age-induced decrease in 
3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels was observed, suggesting that the aging process 
itself may be responsible for the changes in SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA levels."
2142858,"Low-dose infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) into humans reduce 
cardiac filling pressures without enhancing renal excretion or producing 
vasodilation. The present human study was undertaken to seek an effect of ANP on 
capillary filtration in humans and to determine its relationship to reductions 
in cardiac filling pressures. Heart rate (electrocardiogram), blood pressure 
(cuff method), and renal excretion of salt and water were determined, and 
central venous pressure (jugular vein cannulation, strain-gauge transducer) and 
forearm venous compliance and capillary filtration coefficient (strain-gauge 
plethysmography) were derived by computer. Forearm girth and venous pressure 
(peripheral vein catheter) measurements were obtained while the arm was elevated 
above heart level, and an upper arm blood pressure cuff was intermittently 
inflated to venous occluding pressures of 20, 30, and 40 mmHg. Forearm 
measurements, hematocrit, plasma proteins, albumin and plasma levels of ANP were 
determined from euvolemic volunteers before and during 60 min intravenous 
infusions of ANP (5 ng.kg-1.min-1, n = 9) or placebo (isotonic saline, n = 7). 
ANP infusions produced physiological increases (4- to 5-fold) in plasma ANP 
(from a base line 35 +/- 6 pg/ml) (P less than 0.05). Hemodynamic responses to 
ANP consisted of a reduction in central venous pressure (P less than 0.05) and 
no change in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, or renal excretory parameters. 
ANP increased forearm capillary filtration between 37 and 63% (P less than 0.05) 
from base line but did not significantly alter forearm compliance 
measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2143053,"Down syndrome (DS) is a major cause of mental retardation and heart disease. 
Although it is usually caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, a 
subset of the diagnostic features may be caused by the presence of only band 
21q22. We now present evidence that significantly narrows the chromosomal region 
responsible for several of the phenotypic features of DS. We report a molecular 
and cytogenetic analysis of a three-generation family containing four 
individuals with clinical DS as manifested by the characteristic facial 
appearance, endocardial cushion defect, mental retardation, and probably 
dermatoglyphic changes. Autoradiograms of quantitative Southern blots of DNAs 
from two affected sisters, their carrier father, and a normal control were 
analyzed after hybridization with two to six unique DNA sequences regionally 
mapped on chromosome 21. These include cDNA probes for the genes for 
CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mapping in 21q22.1 and for the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) mapping in 21q11.2-21.05, in addition to six probes for 
single-copy sequences: D21S46 in 21q11.2-21.05, D21S47 and SF57 in 21q22.1-22.3, 
and D21S39, D21S42, and D21S43 in 21q22.3. All sequences located in 21q22.3 were 
present in three copies in the affected individuals, whereas those located 
proximal to this region were present in only two copies. In the carrier father, 
all DNA sequences were present in only two copies. Cytogenetic analysis of 
affected individuals employing R and G banding of prometaphase preparations 
combined with in situ hybridization revealed a translocation of the region from 
very distal 21q22.1 to 21qter to chromosome 4q. Except for a possible phenotypic 
contribution from the deletion of chromosome band 4q35, these data provide a 
molecular definition of the minimal region of chromosome 21 which, when 
duplicated, generates the facial features, heart defect, a component of the 
mental retardation, and probably several of the dermatoglyphic changes of DS. 
This region may include parts of bands 21q22.2 and 21q22.3, but it must exclude 
the genes S0D1 and APP and most of band 21q22.1, specifically the region defined 
by S0D1, SF57 and D21S47."

2148091,"Changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and albumin, and 
blood hematocrit (Hct) during treadmill exercise were studied in 6 healthy men 
before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Plasma ANP levels increased during 
exercise and then gradually decreased. There was a concomitant increase in both 
Hct and plasma albumin concentrations. Prior administration of a long-acting 
propranolol, 160 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, markedly elevated plasma ANP 
levels before, during and after exercise. In addition, the mean basal Hct 
increased significantly and further rose during exercise after propranolol 
administration. When increments in plasma ANP concentrations during exercise in 
individual subjects were compared with those in Hct, there was a significant 
positive correlation between the two variables before and after propranolol 
administration. The results indicate a close relationship between the changes in 
plasma ANP and those in Hct during exercise at different ANP levels, and suggest 
that ANP may be at least one of the factors involved in the hemoconcentration 
associated with exercise."
2148510,"Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were examined in 66 patients with 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and in 9 age-matched normal 
controls and 18 hypertensive controls. The diabetic patients were classified 
into three groups according to random urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR, mg/g 
or mg/88.4 nM); group 1 (normo-albuminuria, ACR less than 20, n = 34), group 2 
(borderline microcalbuminuria, 20 less than or equal to ACR less than 100, n = 
17) and group 3 (manifest microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, 100 less than 
or equal to ACR less than 2000, n = 15). Plasma ANP levels (pg per ml) were 
significantly elevated in group 2 (46.0 +/- 19.0 SD) when compared with either 
normal controls (23.8 +/- 14.2), group 1 (28.9 +/- 15.6) or group 3 (26.0 +/- 
12.9). This increase in plasma ANP levels was not related to hypertension. 
Furthermore, plasma ANP levels correlated positively with log(ACR) among the 
patients with ACR under 100 (groups 1 and 2 combined, r = 0.4701, p less than 
0.01). These results suggest that an elevated plasma ANP level in the early 
phase of microalbuminuria possibly plays a pathophysiological role in the 
development of nephropathy in NIDDM patients."
2150641,"The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion 
of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present 
or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size, 
determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5 
days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and 
are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has 
proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the 
infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as 
nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a 
stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood 
pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60% 
the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood 
pressure, e.g. by a calcium antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain 
barrier, is ineffective in reducing the infarct size, normalisation of blood 
pressure alone cannot account for the reductions in infarct size observed with 
isradipine. The antihypertensive drug isradipine seems rather to offer the 
additional benefit of attenuating the consequences of an eventual stroke. If 
clinically confirmed, this will be of considerable therapeutic importance. 
Evidence is presented that isradipine has at least 2 mechanisms within the brain 
that might be responsible for cytoprotection in stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

2154411,"In an attempt to clarify the role of drug-induced protein-associated DNA breaks 
(i.e., DNA topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage) in the cytotoxic activity of 
doxorubicin and etoposide, their cellular effects were compared in 2 human 
small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines, characterized by differential sensitivity 
to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. These drugs were selected for comparative 
studies since they are among the most effective agents in the treatment of SCLC. 
H146 and N592 cell lines were obtained from pleural effusion and bone-marrow 
aspirate of pretreated patients, respectively. Both cell lines grew as floating 
aggregates with similar doubling times (30 and 33 hr for N592 and H146 cells, 
respectively). Although, immediately after 1 hr exposure to equitoxic drug 
levels, the extent of DNA cleavage produced by doxorubicin was markedly lower 
than that produced by etoposide, DNA lesions produced by doxorubicin persisted 
and even increased following drug removal. In contrast, an almost complete 
disappearance of etoposide-induced DNA breaks was noted 1 hr after drug removal. 
Resealing of strand breaks was faster in N592 than in H146 cells. These findings 
suggest that reversal of these lesions plays a major role in cell survival 
rather than the occurrence of DNA breaks immediately following drug exposure. 
This observation is consistent with the view that inhibition of DNA re-ligation 
rather than stimulation of DNA cleavage is the critical step for drug action. 
The different response of these cell lines to cytotoxic action of the 
topoisomerase inhibitors is associated with a differential drug effect on DNA 
integrity (detected as DNA double-strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links). 
However DNA lesions were comparable when cells were exposed to equitoxic drug 
levels. The observation that etoposide-induced DNA breaks were similar in 
isolated nuclei from both cell lines suggests that drug-target interaction is 
modulated in a different manner in the intact cell. As indicated by doxorubicin 
uptake and retention, cellular drug pharmacokinetics do not account for the 
different drug response of the studied SCLC lines, presumably, reflecting a 
different extent of DNA break formation and/or a different cytotoxic consequence 
of DNA damage."
2154743,"Propionic acidemia is an inherited disorder of organic acid metabolism that is 
caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC; EC 6.4.1.3). Affected

of PCC, respectively. We have detected an unusual insertion/deletion in the DNA 
of patients from the pccBC and pccC subgroups that replaces 14 nucleotides in 
the coding sequence of the beta subunit with 12 nucleotides unrelated to this 
region of the gene. This results in elimination of an Msp I restriction site, a 
2-base-pair (bp) deletion, a frameshift, and a stop codon in the new frame 
approximately 100 amino acid residues proximal to the normal carboxyl terminus. 
Among 14 unrelated Caucasian patients in the pccBC complementation group, this 
unique mutation was found in 8 of 28 mutant alleles examined. Mutant 
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic DNAs revealed 
that the inserted 12 nucleotides do not originate in an approximately 1000-bp 
region around the mutation. In the course of our investigation, we identified 
another mutation in the same exon: a 3-bp in-frame deletion that eliminates one 
of two isoleucine codons immediately preceding the Msp I site. Two unrelated 
patients were compound heterozygotes for this single-codon deletion and for the 
insertion/deletion described above. We conclude that either there is a 
propensity for the PCC beta-subunit gene to undergo mutations of this sort at 
this position or, more likely, the mutations in all of the involved Caucasian 
patients have a common origin in preceding generations."
2157558,"A mutant murine cell line has previously been reported to be resistant to the 
AT-specific DNA minor groove ligand 2',5'-bi-1H-benzimidazole, 
2',(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl), trichloride (Ho33342), due to an 
enhanced capacity to remove ligand molecules from cellular DNA via a pathway 
which can be blocked by DNA topoisomerase poisons. We have studied the 
relationship between ligand resistance and DNA topoisomerase II activity. The 
cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently 
(anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, 
and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 
4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating 
(VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. The mutant was cross-resistant to 
distamycin A alone. The mutant showed no abnormality in: (i) the in vitro 
decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, (ii) VP16-213 or mAMSA induced 
protein-DNA cross-linking activities in nuclear extracts, (iii) 'cleavable 
complex' generation (or DNA strand scisson) in intact cells exposed to 
topoisomerase poisons. Ho33342 and the topoisomerase II inhibitor novobiocin 
were found to disrupt both the in vitro binding of nuclear extracted proteins, 
from mutant and parental cells, to plasmid DNA and the formation of drug-induced 
cleavable complexes in vitro. Unexpectedly, Ho33342 induced significant levels 
of DNA-protein crosslinking in both parental and mutant cells. We conclude that: 
(i) resistance of the mutant is limited to non-covalently binding minor groove 
ligands, (ii) Ho33342 can block the trapping of DNA topoisomerase II by enzyme 
poisons in vitro, (iii) Ho33342 can induce a novel form of DNA-protein 
cross-link in intact cells, and (iv) the resistance of the mutant is not 
dependent upon some abnormality in topoisomerase II function."
2157692,"In the great majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the 
reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), 
resulting in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome produces fusion DNA sequences 
consisting of the 5' part of the major breakpoint cluster region-1 (M-BCR-1) and 
the ABL protooncogene which encodes for the P210BCR-ABL phosphoprotein with 
tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Molecular 
analysis was performed on 25 patients with Ph-positive CML using 2 breakpoint 
cluster region (bcr) probes within the M-BCR-1 DNA sequences, and two of them 
did not contain either detectable rearranged DNA homologous to the 5' side bcr 
probe or ABL-related fusion mRNA. The chromosomal in situ hybridization 
technique revealed that these two Ph-positive CML cases did not carry DNAs 
homologous to the 5' bcr or ABL probes on the Ph chromosome. Furthermore, one of 
the two Ph-positive CML cases did not show either rearranged DNA or regions 
homologous to the 3' bcr probe on a 9q+ chromosome, while the other CML case 
showed a rearrangement detected by the 3' bcr probe and transposition of the 3' 
bcr homologous to the 9q+ chromosome. Thus, the possibility is raised that the 
BCR/ABL fusion DNA has been deleted in rare CML cases, and that the deletion 
possibly occurred in a stepwise manner following the formation of the Ph 
chromosome at any stage of the disease."
2158793,"Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy. However, a critical 
review of the literature reveals numerous reasons for doubting a relationship of 
2,4-D to polyneuropathy: (1) too few cases given the wide use of the chemical; 
(2) no valid toxicologic or epidemiologic evidence; (3) the diversity of 
antecedent illness; (4) an unlikely time sequence of antecedent illness to 
exposure (pharmacokinetics); (5) the lack of polyneuropathy in medical patients 
given repetitive doses of 2,4-D; (6) the lack of polyneuropathy in heavily 
exposed military personnel involved in operation Ranch Hand; (7) the biological 
properties of 2,4-D which minimize penetration of 2,4-D into the nervous system 
under normal exposure conditions; and (8) the lack of polyneuropathy in a 
variety of experimental animal species given 2,4-D by several routes of exposure 
and at dose levels and durations of exposure many times greater than human 
applicator exposure. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an 
unlikely cause of polyneuropathy."
2159380,"The effect of combinations of the anthracycline aclarubicin and the 
topoisomerase II targeting drugs 
4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-ethylidene-beta-D-glucopyra noside) 
(VP-16) and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) was 
investigated in a clonogenic assay. The cytotoxicity of VP-16 was almost 
completely antagonized by preincubating cells with nontoxic concentrations of 
aclarubicin. The inhibition of cytotoxicity was not seen when the cells were 
exposed to aclarubicin after exposure to VP-16. The inhibition was significant 
over a wide range of aclarubicin concentrations (3 nM to 0.4 microM), above 
which the toxicity of aclarubicin became apparent. A similar effect was seen on 
the toxicity of m-AMSA. In contrast to aclarubicin, preincubation with 
Adriamycin did not antagonize the effect of VP-16. With purified topoisomerase 
II and naked DNA, aclarubicin did not stimulate the formation of cleavable 
complexes between topoisomerase II and DNA. Aclarubicin concentrations above 1 
microM inhibited the baseline formation of cleavable complexes elicited with the 
enzyme alone. Low (1 to 10 nM) aclarubicin concentrations increased the 
formation of cleavable complexes obtained with VP-16 and m-AMSA; however, at 
aclarubicin concentrations above 1 microM an antagonistic effect was obtained. 
In cells, the m-AMSA- and VP-16-induced, protein-concealed DNA strand breaks 
were completely inhibitable by aclarubicin preincubation with no synergic dose 
levels. Our results suggest that aclarubicin inhibits topoisomerase II-mediated 
DNA cleavage. This inhibition could represent the mechanism of action of the 
drug and explain the lack of cross-resistance to the classical anthracyclines. 
The observed antagonism could have consequences for scheduling of aclarubicin 
with topoisomerase II-active anticancer drugs."

2162733,"A patient previously reported to have Ewing's sarcoma showed a t(11;22) 
(q23;q11) and spontaneous expression of fra(11)(q23) [1]. Subsequent review of 
pathologic specimen indicated, however, that it was an Askin's tumor. Reciprocal 
translocations of chromosomes 11 and 22 are the most common cytogenetic 
abnormalities in Ewing's sarcoma and the related Askin's tumor. After radiation 
therapy of a residual metastatic brain lesion, subsequent studies of the 
recurrent brain tumor indicated the presence of the original translocations as 
well as five new reciprocal translocations and two deleted segments (9p-, 10p-). 
The new chromosome abnormalities were consistently found, indicating that 
progression of the tumor was clonal. The newly observed clonal aberrations were 
considered secondary in nature. A relationship between craniocerebral 
irradiation and development of brain tumors has been reported in several 
studies, but the mechanism for tumor induction has not yet been elucidated. It 
is important that the role of radiation therapy in the evolutionary process of 
chromosomal changes be studied in a large group of similar cases."
2163170,"The authors relate a unique observation of the familial form of proximal 
myodystrophy with early contractures and malignant course. The primary character 
of muscular injury was confirmed on electromyography. The data of 
electrocardiography and echocardiography attested to the presence in the 
patients of the signs of cardiomyopathy. Since the disease was diagnosed in 3 
brothers, the X-coupled recessive type of its inheritance is assumed. An opinion 
is advanced that the described form is a clinical variety of Emery-Dreyfus 
myodystrophy."
2164630,"The effect of cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, morpholinyldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, 
and Actinomycin D were studied on purified mouse leukemia (L1210) DNA 
topoisomerases I and II. DNA unwinding and cross-linking were also studied. It 
was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and 
Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced 
cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated 
DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA 
intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA 
topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only 
cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could 
be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of 
morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data 
indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA 
topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The stabilization of 
cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA 
topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II."
2164822,"CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) are structurally related integral transmembrane 
glycoproteins that function as cellular receptors for human C3b and C3dg, 
respectively. The primary sequence of the most common structural allotype of CR1 
and that of CR2 have been established, and ligand binding on the molecules has 
been mapped. CR1 and CR2 genes are located in close vicinity in the RCA locus of 
chromosome 1. CR1 has a wide cellular/tissular distribution and mediates a 
variety of biologic functions, including the transport of C3-bearing immune 
complexes on erythrocytes, enhancement of phagocytosis, induction of IL-1 
secretion and enhancement of B-cell differentiation. Expression of CR2 is 
restricted to B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells. The receptor 
modulates B-cell growth. CR2 also serves as the receptor for EBV and determines 
the cellular tropism of the virus. This review discusses the molecular biology 
and functional characteristics of CR1 and CR2. It focuses on alterations of 
expression of the receptors in disease, with particular emphasis on the genetic 
and acquired factors that contribute to the defective expression of CR1 in 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus."
2165587,"L1 (LINE-1), a long interspersed repetitive DNA family of mammalian genomes, is 
thought to be a sequence family derived from a retrotransposon-like element(s), 
but its actively transposable unit(s) has not been identified yet. We developed 
a novel method for selective isolation of the human L1 sequences which 
transposed in a relatively recent past and may have still retained a feature of 
the 'active L1' unit. From the inspection of the nucleotide sequences, we 
conjectured that the 'active L1' or 'nearly active L1' units should have a high 
content of the CpG dinucleotide sequence, a mutation hot spot sequence, and 
contain several sites for rare cutters such as BssH II and Nar I at their 5' 
terminal regions. Using these rare cutter sites as selection markers, the L1 
sequences were isolated, which had the high content of CpG at the 5' terminal 
regions and over 90% homology to L1 transcripts found in a human teratocarcinoma 
cell line. These L1s were shown to be 'relatively new L1' units which had 
integrated into chromosomes within these several million years during evolution. 
From the sequence data of these L1s and L1 cDNA, a consensus sequence of the 5' 
terminal region of high CpG L1s were constructed. A region of the consensus 
sequence showed about 69% homology to the 5' terminal region of Drosophila 
jockey element."

2168257,"Forty-four previously diagnosed surgical biopsy specimens of oligodendroglioma 
with calcification from the file of Veterans General Hospital-Taipei between 
1977-1985 form the base of this study. Thirty-two patients (72.8%) had varied 
degree of calcification deposits in tumor parenchyma related to blood vessels 
while 12 patients (27.2%) in tumor parenchyma unrelated to blood vessels. Ten 
patients (22.7%) disclosed calcification at the vicinity of tumor tissue. 
Histochemical studies of the calcified deposits revealed no trace minerals other 
than calcium and iron. Electron microscopic examination of the calculi showed 
membrane-bound vesicles and radially precipitated crystals that simulated 
hydroxyapatite of psammoma body in meningioma. There was no statistically 
significant correlation between the demise or recurrence of patients and the 
calcification of tumor when Chi-squared test was applied."
2168281,"The cytotoxic actions of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators are 
thought to result from some disturbance to DNA metabolism following trapping of 
the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Here we 
have studied topoisomerase II trapping and DNA synthesis patterns in relation to 
the acute cytotoxic actions of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide 
(mAMSA) or mitoxantrone on SV40 transformed human fibroblasts. These two DNA 
intercalators differed significantly in their cytotoxic potential, mitoxantrone 
being 24-fold more toxic than mAMSA when assayed by the inhibition of 
clonogenicity. Although both drugs induced G2 delay at cytotoxic concentrations, 
mAMSA-treated cells recovered normal cell cycle phase distributions within 24 h 
of removal of drug, while mitoxantrone-treated cells continued to accumulate in 
G2 up to 48 h following drug treatment with evidence of complete inhibition of 
entry into mitosis. Compared with mAMSA, mitoxantrone showed a similar capacity 
to induce cleavable complexes in cellular DNA, and only a 2-fold greater ability 
to inhibit DNA synthesis. Within a 4-h posttreatment period, mAMSA-treated cells 
recovered normal rates of DNA synthesis, whereas a continued depression of DNA 
synthesis was observed in mitoxantrone-treated cells. The recovery patterns of 
DNA synthesis correlated with the rapid disappearance of mAMSA-induced complexes 
(less than 27% lesions remaining 2 h after drug removal) and the persistence of 
mitoxantrone-induced complexes during a 4-h posttreatment period. This 
difference in complex longevity was observed in other human transformed 
fibroblast cell lines irrespective of differences in the absolute levels of 
complexes induced by either agent. We suggest that the results provide evidence 
that DNA intercalators may differ in the forms of complexes induced and that the 
comparatively high cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone relates to the ability of the 
drug to trap topoisomerase II complexes in a form which effects a long-term 
inhibition of DNA replication and G2 traverse."
2168357,"In the 1950's it was first observed that mammalian cells exposed to the 
halogenated deoxyuridines were more sensitive to ultraviolet light and radiation 
than untreated cells. This prompted early clinical trials with bromodeoxyuridine 
(BUdR) which showed mixed results. More recently, several Phase I studies, while 
establishing the feasibility of continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of BUdR, 
have reported significant dose limiting skin and bone marrow toxicities and have 
questioned the optimal method of BUdR delivery. To exploit the high mitotic 
activity of malignant gliomas relative to surrounding normal brain tissue, we 
have developed a permanently implantable infusion pump system for safe, 
continuous intraarterial (IA) internal carotid BUdR delivery. Since July 1985, 
23 patients with malignant brain tumors (18 grade 4, 5 grade 3) have been 
treated in a Phase I clinical trial using IA BUdR (400-600 mg/m2/day X 8 1/2 
weeks) and focal external beam radiotherapy (59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/day in 6 1/2 
weeks). Following initial biopsy/surgery the infusion pump system was implanted; 
BUdR infusion began 2 weeks prior to and continued throughout the 6 1/2 week 
course of radiotherapy. There have been no vascular complications. Side-effects 
in all patients have included varying degrees of anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral 
forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis. Myelosuppression requiring 
dose reduction occurred in one patient. An overall Kaplan-Meier estimated median 
survival of 20 months has been achieved. As in larger controlled series, 
histologic grade and age are prognostically significant. We have shown in a 
Phase I study that IA BUdR radiosensitization is safe, tolerable, may lead to 
improved survival, and appears to be an efficacious primary treatment of 
malignant gliomas."
2173098,"Nearly 30 years have elapsed since Rowe and Weller and their colleagues 
discovered human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Because of its complex structure, long 
replicative cycle, low yield in vitro, and highly species-specific 
cell-substrate requirement, the cellular and molecular biologic analyses of 
human CMV have been slow, but recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibody 
technologies are bringing about rapid changes. Because of the long period of 
latency and wide range of disease presentations, epidemiologic and medical 
insights have also come slowly. However, the clinical events that occur during 
iatrogenic immunosuppression (transplantation and cancer therapy) and as a 
result of immunocompromise due to human immunodeficiency virus infection are 
currently promoting our understanding of the epidemiology of CMV disease and the 
definition of its clinical spectrum. Rapid diagnostic methods, antiviral drugs, 
and vaccines for CMV are becoming available. We may not yet understand 
completely the impact of this agent on the nonimmunosuppressed or aspects of its 
pathogenesis: e.g., the immune functions controlling recrudescence and the 
possibility of increased disease severity in those with no detectable immune 
defect. With the availability of new approaches, other issues should be 
clarified, such as the functions of host and virus involved in the mechanism of 
persistence."
2173390,"Soluble-fiber breakfast cereals were examined for their cholesterol-lowering 
ability in 58 male patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients followed a step 1 
diet for a minimum of 6 wk, then were randomly assigned to groups incorporating 
either corn flakes or one of two soluble-fiber cereals (pectin enriched or 
psyllium enriched) in the diet for an additional 6 wk. During the diet-only 
phase, total cholesterol dropped 3.8%. During the cereal-plus-diet phase, total 
and LDL cholesterol values of the pectin-enriched cereal group dropped an 
additional 2.1% (P = 0.243) and 3.9% (P = 0.16), respectively, and they dropped 
5.9% (P = 0.005) and 5.7% (P = 0.034), respectively, in the psyllium-enriched 
cereal group. During the cereal-plus-diet phase, no significant effects on HDL 
cholesterol, triglyceride, or body weight were found within or between any 
cereal groups. These results support use of soluble-fiber cereals as an 
effective and well-tolerated part of a prudent diet in the treatment of mild to 
moderate hypercholesterolemia."
2173580,"Previous studies in our laboratory showed that ANP inhibits increases in 
endothelial monolayer permeability to macromolecules induced by thrombin. In 
this present study, we investigated the second messenger system involved in the 
influence of ANP on monolayer permeability. In bovine aortic endothelial cells 
(BAEC), ANP (100 nM) caused increased cGMP levels which were measurable at 30 
sec and maximal at 3 min. Addition of 8-bromo cGMP (1 mM) to BAEC monolayers 
mimicked the actions of ANP by inhibiting thrombin- mediated increases in 
permeability to [125I]-labeled bovine serum albumin. Inhibition of increases in 
permeability by lower concentrations of ANP was enhanced by the cGMP-selective 
phosphodiesterase inhibitor, M&B 22948 (100 microM). The use of ANP structural 
analogs which stimulate cGMP production (AP III or BNP) prevented 
thrombin-induced increases in monolayer permeability, whereas AP-I, which does 
not increase cGMP levels, was ineffective."
2176016,"30 patients with primary or recurrent malignant brain tumors (9 primary, 18 
recurrent malignant gliomas, 1 malignant meningioma, 2 melanomas) were treated 
altogether 37 times by photodynamic therapy (PDT) whether after intravenous, 
intraarterial or direct intratumoral sensitisation by hematoporphyrin (HPD) 
after conventional surgical removal of the tumor mass. The light was produced by 
an Argon pumped dye laser at doses varying from 40-220 J/cm2. A single dose of 
radiation of 4 Gy was administered to 18 patients immediately after PDT. The 9 
patients with primary glioblastomas received in addition a full course of 
radiation therapy. The histological specimens taken during PDT demonstrated 
tumor necrosis, with oedema of normal brain tissue adjacent to the tumorbed. The 
median survival of patients with multiple recurrences and various radio- and 
chemotherapeutic modalities was 6 months (range 4-13 months). 9 patients with 
primary manifestation of a glioblastoma had a median survival of 19 months 
(0.5-29 months). Increased phototoxicity of the skin was the only side effect of 
PDT and did not reduce the quality of life of the patients."
2176962,"The sex chromosomal constitution has been determined in various types of human 
leukocytes at interphase by use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with X-

of myelocytes into polymorphs there is no significant change in the relative 
frequency of various types of male and female cells with a specific type of sex 
chromosomal constitution. Non-random variability of the relative proximity 
between the X chromosomes within the nuclei is also observed in female cells. 
Moreover, we are the first to determine that sex-specific ""drumsticks"" and

2180939,"Conantokin-T, a 21-amino acid peptide which induces sleep-like symptoms in young 
mice was purified from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, Conus tulipa. 
The amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined and verified by chemical

gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The sequence of the peptide is: 
Gly-Glu-Gla-Gla-Tyr-Gln-Lys-Met-Leu-Gla-Asn-Leu-Arg-Gla-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys- 
Lys-Asn-Ala-NH2. Conantokin-T inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor-mediated calcium influx in central nervous system neurons. This 
observation suggests that like conantokin-G (a homologous Conus peptide with 
recently identified NMDA antagonist activity) conantokin-T has NMDA antagonist 
activity. A sequence comparison of conantokins-T and -G identifies the 4 Gla 
residues and the N-terminal dipeptide sequence as potential key elements for the 
biological activity of this peptide."
2185802,"Cytotoxic agents may cause interstitial or eosinophilic pneumonitis, alveolar 
proteinosis, pulmonary venous occlusive disease, pulmonary fibrosis, 
pneumothorax, or pulmonary oedema. These agents may also potentiate lung injury 
caused by radiotherapy or high oxygen fractions in inspired air. Clinical and 
roentgenological features of lung damage induced by cytotoxic drugs are usually 
non-specific, and differential diagnoses include progression of the malignant 
disease and a plethora of opportunistic infections. Monitoring of blood gases 
and carbon monoxide transfer factor may facilitate early detection of drug 
induced lung injury. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, 
transbronchial biopsy, or open lung biopsy may be necessary for reliable 
diagnosis. Early detection of lung damage and immediate withdrawal of the 
responsible agent(s) are essential. Steroids may be of therapeutic value in some 
patients."
2186790,"Tretinoin was shown in the late 1960s to be useful for the treatment of 
disorders associated with abnormal epithelial differentiation; however, because 
of irritation, retinoids were only slowly accepted. In the 1970s, evidence 
accumulated to show that topical tretinoin could modulate many of the 
abnormalities in the epidermis and dermis associated with photoageing. It has 
been shown in hairless mice that tretinoin can reverse dermal elastosis with the 
formation of new collagen and this has led to clinical trials being carried out 
in man. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is 
effective in the treatment of photoaged skin."
2187446,"The legal systems of the Germanic tribes in the early Middle Ages elaborated 
detailed catalogs of forfeits in compensation for certain physical injuries. The 
perpetrator had to pay the forfeit to the injured person, or in case of 
manslaughter, to the tribe of the dead. By doing so he could avert the feud 
which otherwise faced him. These catalogs of forfeits exactly reflect the 
relative value that was appointed to certain parts of the body and to sensory 
functions. The catalog of the Lex Saxonum (c. 802), in which physical injuries 
are listed, ranging from loss of single phalanges, differentiated between thumb, 
forefinger, small finger, and the other fingers, to death, is compared with 
modern grades of disability. There are surprising parallels and interesting 
contrasts. Bilateral deafness is put on a level with bilateral blindness, the 
loss of both hands, both feet, both testicles, and death."
2230849,"A young woman with humeroperoneal muscular dystrophy and contractures received a 
heart transplant for a severe dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac histopathology 
consisted of myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and nuclear 
hyperchromaticity without mitochondrial abnormalities. Myopathy and heart 
disease were not clinically evident in her family, although three relatives had 
unexplained shortened Achilles tendons without weakness. Tendon contractures may 
be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal 
dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically 
similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women. 
Rather than the cardiac arrhythmias typical of EDMD, a dilated cardiomyopathy 
may occur and present with severe congestive heart failure. This is the first 
report of cardiac transplantation in such a case."
2231833,"The clinical efficacy of different doses of the specific benzodiazepine 
antagonist flumazenil was studied in a total of 72 patients with benzodiazepine

and eight patients (group 2) with suspected benzodiazepine overdose received 5 
mg (group 1) or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil or placebo, respectively. The stage of 
coma, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were monitored within the 
following 15 min. If no change in the stage of coma was observed, 5 mg (group 1) 
or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil were given, and the stage of coma, heart rate and 
blood pressure were again monitored. In a similar way, the effect of 5 and 1 mg 
flumazenil was investigated in 13 patients (group 3) and four patients (group 4) 
with ethanol intoxication. In an open trial, the clinical efficacy of flumazenil 
for the diagnosis of benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose was studied in 29 
patients (group 5). In all patients, a toxicological screening confirmed 
benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose. None of the patients receiving placebo 
showed effects on stage of coma, heart rate, blood pressure or respiratory rate. 
Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained 
consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. The effect of 1 mg 
flumazenil (group 2) on benzodiazepine-induced coma was less pronounced. In 
patients with ethanol overdose (group 3), ethanol-induced coma was reversed 
after 5 mg flumazenil more slowly than in patients of group 1. No effect of 
flumazenil on ethanol-induced coma was observed in group 4. In group 5, 
flumazenil proved to be useful for diagnosing benzodiazepine or ethanol 
intoxication. In one patient with coma due to carbamazepine overdose, flumazenil 
was also found to be effective. Additionally, a possible analytical interference 
of flumazenil and its metabolites with the identification of other 
benzodiazepines by a toxicological screening procedure was studied. Even after 
an oral dose of 200 mg flumazenil, no interference with immunological 
benzodiazepine assays (EMIT, TDX, and RIA) was found. A metabolite and an 
artifact of flumazenil could be identified in urine by gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry."
2231917,"Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be 
highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Complications from 
bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy are usually minor but serious and even fatal 
reactions can occur. Five recent cases illustrate the gravity of bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin sepsis. One man with severe debility and the organic brain 
syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that 
progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of 
isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis 
with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine 
for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, 
including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous 
absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
treatment should not be administered in the presence of severe cystitis or after 
grossly traumatic catheterization."
2233735,"The DNA sequences of a cDNA clone and the macronuclear genomic fragment 
corresponding to the functional copy of the SerH3 surface antigen gene of 
Tetrahymena thermophila were determined. Primer extension and nuclease 
protection assays show that the SerH3 transcription unit is 1,425 nucleotides 
long and contains no introns. The predicted polypeptide encoded by the SerH3 
gene has a molecular mass of 44,415 daltons; one-third of its 439 residues are 
either cysteine, serine, or threonine. The central half of the polypeptide 
consists of three homologous domains in tandem array; within these domains, the 
cysteine, proline, and tryptophan residues occur in highly regular patterns."
2233790,"The authors have used the modified method of the direct gene cloning suggested 
by Nichols et al to isolate HLA-B27 gene from a patient suffering from 
ankylosing spondylitis. Five restriction enzymes (ClaI, HindIII, SnaBI, PvuI, 
SalGI) which had no recognition sites within the 6.0 kb EcoRI-BamHI-DNA fragment 
supposedly containing the HLA-B27 gene have been chosen by 
blotting-hybridization of the restriction fragments of the patients DNA with 
HLA-B27-specific probe. The 6.0 +/- 0.5 kb DNA fragments were isolated and 
cloned after the DNA treatment by 300 micrograms of all of these restriction 
enzymes. The obtained mini-library containing 280 recombinants has been screened 
with the use of HLA-B27 specific oligonucleotide probe. The clone PB27-2 has 
been isolated the restriction map of which is identical to HLA-B27k. The authors 
are planning to determine the sequence of the isolated gene in order to find a 
possible structural defect in it."
2233870,"The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases 
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy 
(Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic 
polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral 
nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides 
(mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing 
factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with 
enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have 
failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the 
designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular 
diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance 
of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication 
other than in the active effect."
2237235,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease where corticoids are the basis of 
therapy. They are taken for short periods in large amounts, as well as for 
prolonged periods in medium or small doses. The authors investigated in the 
described groups the effect of corticoids on bone tissue. They provided evidence 
of a significant effect on the diffraction pattern, geometrical arrangement of 
the apatite grid and ion changes in relation to the period of corticoid 
administration without significant clinical manifestations of osteoporosis, when 
respecting therapeutic principles."
2238088,"Enhancers have been defined operationally as cis-regulatory sequences that can 
stimulate transcription of RNA polymerase-II-transcribed genes over large 
distances and even when located downstream of the gene. Recently, it has become 
evident that enhancers can also stimulate transcription in trans if they are 
brought into close proximity to the promoter/gene. These reports provide clues 
to the mechanism of remote enhancer action. In addition, the findings, together 
with genetic studies in Drosophila, strongly suggest that enhancer action in 
trans could underlie phenomena such as 'transvection', where one chromosome 
affects gene expression in the paired homolog."
2240392,"With the increased use of prophylactic and broad-spectrum antibiotics, 
pseudomembranous colitis has emerged as a significant clinical problem. 
Management with specific anti-Clostridium difficile therapy (vancomycin or 
metronidazole) has reduced mortality to less than 2%. Nevertheless, the disease 
may progress to a fulminant toxic colitis or colonic perforation. Additionally, 
another subset of patients will present with a dramatic clinical picture, 
suggesting acute peritonitis, eventuating in unnecessary laparotomy. This report 
reviews both the medical and surgical literature during the past 15 years of 
patients treated for pseudomembranous colitis. Analysis of this clinical data 
has provided us with the opportunity to both define the role of surgery in this 
disorder and illustrate the necessity for a combined medical and surgical 
cooperative approach in the early management of this iatrogenic disease."
2242013,"To elucidate the mechanism of thyroid hormone-induced hyperinsulinemia, the 
acute and direct effect of thyroid hormone administration on insulin secretion 
was investigated in rats in vivo and in vitro. In the perfused rat pancreas, the 
addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) 
to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of 
thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level 
from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL, while blood 
glucose and plasma glucagon were unchanged. This phenomenon was inhibited 
completely by the preadministration of oxprenolol hydrochloride (2 mg/kg, s.c.), 
and inhibited partly by the preadministration of metoprolol tartrate (35 mg/kg, 
s.c.). These results suggest that thyroid hormone induces hyperinsulinemia via 
beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat."
2247152,"Why sex exists remains an unsolved problem in biology. If mutations are on the 
average deleterious, a high mutation rate can account for the evolution of sex. 
One form of this mutational hypothesis is Muller's ratchet. If the mutation rate 
is high, mutation-free individuals become rare and they can be lost by genetic 
drift in small populations. In asexual populations, as Muller noted, the loss is 
irreversible and the load of deleterious mutations increases in a ratchet-like 
manner with the successive loss of the least-mutated individuals. Sex can be 
advantageous because it increases the fitness of sexual populations by 
re-creating mutation-free individuals from mutated individuals and stops (or 
slows) Muller's ratchet. Although Muller's ratchet is an appealing hypothesis, 
it has been investigated and documented experimentally in only one group of 
organisms--ciliated protozoa. I initiated a study to examine the role of 
Muller's ratchet on the evolution of sex in RNA viruses and report here a 
significant decrease in fitness due to Muller's ratchet in 20 lineages of the 
RNA bacteriophage phi 6. These results show that deleterious mutations are 
generated at a sufficiently high rate to advance Muller's ratchet in an RNA 
virus and that beneficial, backward and compensatory mutations cannot stop the 
ratchet in the observed range of fitness decrease."
2249207,"Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous 
system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with 
the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited 
condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast 
cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid 
plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the 
syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring 
in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus 
neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development 
in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome."
2249848,"Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism resulting from a deficiency 
of propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. The alpha- and beta-subunits of the 
enzyme are encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. Using direct 
sequencing and restriction digests of amplified reverse transcripts and genomic 
DNA, we have identified two mutations of the PCCB gene in a propionic acidemia 
patient from the pccC complementation subgroup (the PCCB gene contains the major 
complementation group pccBC and subgroups pccB and pccC). One of the proband 
alleles contains an inframe 3-bp deletion inherited from the father which 
results in the deletion of an isoleucine residue in the beta-subunit of the 
enzyme. The other mutant allele, inherited from the mother, has a 14-bp deletion 
and an addition of 12 bp of new sequence at the same site as the father's 
allele. The inserted sequence is a partial duplication of a sequence just 
upstream of the mutation site. The net result of this mutation generates a 
frameshift and a downstream stop codon. Examination of fibroblast mRNA from the 
patient showed that it consists essentially of the father's sequence, making it 
effectively the only expressed allele for the beta-protein. A survey of 
additional patient cell lines revealed the insertion/deletion rearrangement in 
three additional patients, two from the pccBC group and one unclassified. The 
3-bp deletion allele was unique to the proband. The identification of two 
distinct alleles occurring at the same site in the PCCB gene underscores the 
importance of this site in enzyme function or integrity."
2253708,"The prokaryotic genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation 
pressure (GC/AT pressure) that has been exerted on the entire genome. This 
pressure affects the synonymous codon choice, the amino acid composition of 
proteins and tRNA anticodons. Unassigned codons would have been produced in 
bacteria with extremely high GC or AT genomes by deleting certain codons and the 
corresponding tRNAs. A high AT pressure together with genomic economization led 
to a change in assignment of the UGA codon, from stop to tryptophan, in 
Mycoplasma."
2253729,"Nine hundred eighty-three top Italian track and field athletes (700 males and 
283 females) were examined for survival, mortality and causes of death for an 
average follow-up period of 18.6 years starting from their last year of 
competition as members of the national team. Overall mortality rates were 
compared to the rates expected on the basis of the life tables for Italian 
people of the same age, sex and time period. Thirty-four deaths were observed 
among males (vs 46.6 expected) with a O/E ratio of 0.73, while 3 deaths were 
observed among women (vs 6.2 expected) with a O/E ratio of 0.48. Neither of 
these differences was significant, but the O/E ratio for the group as a whole 
was quite significant (p = 0.0296). Some of the athletes demonstrated 
behavioural characteristics developed during their active careers that might 
have contributed to their low mortality rate."
2255999,"Cebocephaly (hypotelorism, single-nostril nose) and ethmocephaly (hypotelorism, 
interorbital proboscis) lie in the middle of the spectrum of craniofacial 
changes associated with holoprosencephaly. Because these defects and thorough 
anatomic studies of them are rare, knowledge concerning morphologic as well as 
pathogenetic relationships is lacking. We report the autopsy findings and 
anatomic features of the dried skull of a 31 week fetus with cebocephaly and the 
craniofacial dissection of a 36 week fetus with ethmocephaly. Both manifested 
dysplastic changes of the ethmoid bone and anterior portion of the sphenoid 
bone, with concomitant hypotelorism and defects of the medial orbital walls. 
Through these latter defects, the eyes were joined in the ethmocephalic fetus 
(synophthalmia). Other changes of bone (single optic foramen, approximated 
maxillae, choanal atresia, thickened palate) and soft tissue (eccentric or fused 
extraocular muscles, single optic nerve) in both fetuses resembled those 
reported in other cases of cebocephaly and ethmocephaly, as well as cyclopia. In 
the 19th century, both cebocephaly and ethmocephaly were classified as two-orbit 
variants of cyclopia, a view supported by the present study."
2256586,"Topical minoxidil, used in the treatment of baldness, has been commercially 
available since 1987. Its systemic side effects are rare. We observed an as yet 
unreported ""polymyalgia syndrome"" in four otherwise healthy males whose sole 
medication was topically applied minoxidil. They experienced fatigue, weight 
loss and severe pain in the shoulders and pelvic girdle, suggesting connective 
tissue disease. Three patients had a transient rise in liver enzymes, while 
other laboratory analyses remained normal. Tritanomaly was detected in two 
patients who underwent systematic color vision testing. All symptoms disappeared 
after withdrawal of minoxidil. Rechallenge was positive once in one patient and 
twice in another. The mechanism of this side effect remains to be determined."
2261916,"Eighty-eight Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates meeting criteria for 
borderline oxacillin resistance (intermediate susceptibility or resistance to 
oxacillin but susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid upon disk diffusion 
testing) were studied to determine optimal test techniques and conditions for 
differentiating borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) 
from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Further testing 
revealed three distinct resistance patterns: 61 strains (69%) consistently met 
BORSA criteria and had average beta-lactamase levels five- to six-fold higher 
than oxacillin-susceptible controls; 11 strains (13%) were markedly 
heteroresistant MRSA with delayed appearance of resistant colonies leading to 
spurious susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; 16 strains (18%) 
appeared to be oxacillin-susceptible on repetitive testing. Under conditions 
used to elicit intrinsic methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a 
large percentage of BORSA appeared resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. 
This clearly shows that BORSA may be misidentified as MRSA while heteroresistant 
MRSA may appear to be BORSA. It is concluded that amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 
zone sizes should be measured after a full 24 hours of incubation, that 
susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus under certain environmental 
conditions should be interpreted with caution, and that MIC testing is the most 
reliable technique for differentiating these two resistance patterns in 
Staphylococcus aureus."
2264817,"The critical concentration required for filament assembly in vitro from highly 
purified desmin was determined by both turbidity and centrifugation assays. 
Assembly was done in the presence of 2 mM-Ca2+, 2 mM-Mg2+ or 150 mM-Na+ at 2, 22 
and 37 degrees C. Similar values for critical concentration were obtained by 
both assays. As temperature increased, critical concentration decreased for each 
cation. The critical concentration was lowest in the presence of Ca2+ at 2, 22 
and 37 degrees C, but was highest in the presence of 150 mM-Na+ at 2 degrees C. 
Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays 
contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), 
but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average 
diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and 
average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis 
indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly, 
but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated 
that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all 
are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments."
2267227,"A case of a prenatally recognized hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is presented and 
the literature reviewed. These tumors are benign and usually present in early 
infancy with symptoms that are related to the mass effect on adjacent organs. 
Radiologic methods used in the past to image this tumor include angiography and 
ultrasound. However, there is no specific radiologic finding, and, therefore, 
the diagnosis is usually made during surgery. Once the tumor is removed, the 
prognosis is generally good. With the increasing use of high resolution 
ultrasound in prenatal diagnosis, this rare tumor should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of any multicystic mass found in the fetal abdomen. The 
recognition of a mass should then alert the physician to the need for early 
neonatal intervention."
2277190,"CSF evaluation is the single most important aspect of the laboratory diagnosis 
of meningitis. Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, 
mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct 
initial therapy. Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients 
with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell 
differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and 
culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify 
bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of 
tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast 
stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated 
by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be 
obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, 
complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. 
Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold 
great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult 
to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar 
puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may 
result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if 
focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, 
and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is 
accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension. Institution of 
antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while 
neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are 
instituted to reduce intracranial pressure."
2279154,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the long term survival of a group of athletes taking 
prolonged vigorous physical exercise to that of the general population.
DESIGN: Follow up of a cohort of participants in the Dutch eleven cities ice 
skating tour (a race and recreational tour) over a distance of 200 kilometers.
SETTING: Data on participation from the organising committee and data on 
mortality from all municipalities in The Netherlands.
SUBJECTS: 2259 Male athletes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of all cause mortality in male participants in 
the tour with that in the general population of The Netherlands.
RESULTS: The standardised mortality ratio for all participants during 32 years 
of follow up was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.85), and 0.90 (0.48 to 
1.44) for participants in the race, and 0.72 (0.60 to 0.86) for participants in 
the recreational tour who finished within the time limit.
CONCLUSIONS: The capacity for prolonged and vigorous physical exercise, 
particularly if the exercise is recreational, is a strong indicator of 
longevity."
2298257,"We have previously reported that E pluripoietins are produced in mice after a 
single 20-mg injection of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and that they are able to 
initiate the determination of hemopoietic pluripotent stem cells (CFU-S) toward 
the erythrocytic lineage. However, the mechanism of E pluripoietin release is 
still unclear. Since the stimulating effect of thyroid hormone on erythropoiesis 
is well known, we postulated a link between this hormone and the E 
pluripoietins. In previous papers we demonstrated that L-triiodothyronine (LT3) 
exhibits the capacity of inducing CFU-S differentiation toward erythropoiesis in 
vitro. Two series of data presented here suggest that LT3 acts indirectly on 
CFU-S determination by promoting the release of E pluripoietin-like factors. 
First, the Ara-C injection which induces the production of E pluripoietins in 
mice also promotes an increase in the LT3 plasma level. Second, medium 
conditioned with bone marrow cells exposed in vitro for 90 min to LT3 (even 
though this medium does not contain LT3) has E pluripoietin-like effects, 
inducing CFU-S differentiation toward the erythrocytic lineage."
2300390,"We have provided an in-depth, longitudinal, clinical/genetic/pathologic 
investigation of a family consonant with the sarcoma, breast cancer and brain 
tumors, lung and laryngeal cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and adrenalcortical 
carcinoma syndrome. The pattern of cancer expression involves all three germinal 
layers with transmission through multiple generations. Segregation of these 
cancers occur in a manner consonant with an autosomal dominant mode of genetic 
transmission. It is hoped that recognition of the significance of this tumor 
pattern within families will provide an impetus for cancer surveillance, 
control, and laboratory research in the quest for clues to biomarkers which 
correlate with its cancer-prone genotype."
2300562,"The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) external glycoprotein antigens of 
H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of epidemiologically important influenza A viruses 
prevalent during recent decades were subjected to intensive antigenic analysis 
by four different methods. Prior to serological analysis with polyclonal rabbit 
antisera, HA and NA antigens of four viruses of each subtype were segregated by 
genetic reassortment to forestall nonspecific steric hindrance during 
antigen-antibody combination. This analysis has demonstrated that with respect 
to antigenic phenotype, HA and NA proteins have evolved at different rates. With 
H1N1 viruses, an arrest of significant evolution of the NA discordant with the 
continuing antigenic drift of HA was found in the 1980-1983 period. It is 
probable that the different and independent rates of evolution of HA and NA 
reflect the greater selective pressure of HA antibodies, which forces the more 
rapid emergence of HA escape mutants. The slower antigenic change found for NA 
further supports the potential for NA-specific infection-permissive immunization 
as a useful stratagem against influenza."
2303258,"The recurrent translocation breakpoint on chromosome 22 of neuroepithelioma has 
been localized between two probes, D22S1 and D22S15, by both in situ 
hybridization and somatic cell hybrids. These two probes have further been shown 
to be genetically linked at theta = 0.0 and a lod score of 5.3. The two probes 
were unaffected by a partial deletion of the chromosome 22 long arm of a 
meningioma, showing that the meningioma locus is distal to that of the 
neuroepithelioma."
2303880,"Extensive histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed to 
elucidate the histopathogenesis of exencephaly induced in chick embryo as an 
experimental model. The findings were compared with those identified in a chick 
myeloschisis experimental model and in human autopsy cases. The experimental 
model of exencephaly in chick embryos was developed by induction with various 
teratogens including ethylnitrosourea, salicylate, and phenytoin. None of the 
cases of exencephaly was exposed to a teratogen prior to or within Hamburger and 
Hamilton stage 12 (45 to 49 hours postincubation), when the anterior neuropore 
closes. The process of overgrowth in development of exencephaly was identical to 
that of myeloschisis, and the results suggested neuronal overmaturation in the 
histological and immunohistochemical studies. Although the late-stage 
degenerative change with neovascularization over the exposed neural tissue 
(placode) was more severe in human exencephaly, the present experimental study 
may suggest a possible common embryopathogenesis of dysraphism. Exencephaly 
should be regarded as the most severe form of cranium bifidum, as myeloschisis 
is in spina bifida."
2307889,"Sensory conduction of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel for eight 
consecutive 1 cm segments of the nerve was evaluated in 217 hands of 153 of our 
patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Impairment was found to be highly focal 
and often confined to a single 1 cm segment of the nerve. The section of the 
nerve at or just distal to the distal margin of the carpal tunnel was affected 
most frequently, the section within the tunnel was affected less often, and the 
section proximal to the tunnel at the level of the mid-carpal and radio-carpal 
joints was affected least. The greatest contrast between frequencies of slowing 
at adjacent segments occurred at the proximal and distal margins of the carpal 
tunnel. The distribution of the nerve impairment was similar between the sexes; 
however, among the men the segment affected most frequently was located 1 cm 
distal to the segment affected most frequently among the women. The general 
pattern of slowing which we found does not substantiate some commonly-held 
opinions about the aetiology of carpal tunnel syndrome."
2307892,"Heerfordt syndrome is an unusual manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis and is 
characterized by parotitis, uveitis, and facial nerve paralysis. A case is 
presented and the clinical manifestations are discussed. Angiotensin converting 
enzyme assays along with tissue biopsy demonstrating noncaseating granulomas 
confirm the diagnosis."
2309705,"Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed 
to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex 
segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. 
Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of 
probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated 
risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are 
observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs 
increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found 
at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their 
unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex 
segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were 
classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with 
aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible 
with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with 
aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance 
pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene 
with very low penetrance. A model of gene action with random effects during 
morphogenesis is compatible with our observations."
2309781,"Six persons with the classical Angelman syndrome (AS) phenotype and de novo 
deletions of chromosome 15q11-q13 were studied to determine the parental origin 
of the chromosome deletion. Four of the 6 patients had informative cytogenetic 
studies and all demonstrated maternal inheritance of the deletion. These 
findings, together with other reported cases of the origin of the chromosome 15 
deletion in AS, suggest that deletion of the maternally contributed chromosome 
leads to the AS phenotype. This contrasts with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) 
in which a similar deletion of the paternally contributed chromosome 15 is 
observed. In deletion cases, a parental gamete effect such as genomic imprinting 
may be the best model to explain why apparently identical 15q11-q13 deletions 
may develop the different phenotypes of AS or PWS."
2309926,"The transport of thyroxine from the bloodstream to the brain and the synthesis 
and secretion of transthyretin (formerly called prealbumin) were studied in rats 
and in sheep choroid plexus perfused in vitro. Rat choroid plexus contained 4.4 
micrograms and rat liver 0.39 micrograms transthyretin mRNA per gram wet tissue. 
The specific radioactivity of transthyretin isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of 
rats 60 min after intravenous injection of [14C]leucine was greater than 50 
times that of transthyretin from serum. After adding [14C]leucine to the 
perfusion medium of an in vitro perfused sheep choroid plexus, highly 
radioactive transthyretin was isolated from freshly secreted cerebrospinal fluid 
collected from the exposed choroid plexus surface. Secretion of newly 
synthesized transthyretin into the perfusion medium could not be demonstrated. 
After intravenous injection of [125I]-thyroxine into rats, a maximum in the 
curve of radioactivity in tissue plotted against time after injection was 
observed first for choroid plexus, thereafter for cerebrospinal fluid, and still 
later for cortex and striatum. Based on the obtained data, a hypothesis is 
derived for the mechanism of the transport of thyroid hormones from the 
bloodstream to the brain involving transthyretin synthesized in choroid plexus 
and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid."
2315439,"Effects of nalmefene on eating were investigated in two groups of ten male 
volunteers, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The nalmefene treated 
group ate 22% less, both in terms of absolute weight and caloric intake, of a 
standardised buffet-meal than did the placebo group. No differences in 
subjective ratings of hunger or satiety were found between the groups, 
suggesting that the reduced feeding was not a consequence of any change in 
motivation to eat. When analysed by nutrient content, nalmefene was found to 
reduce fat and protein, but not carbohydrate, intakes. Analyses of intakes of 
individual foods showed a differential effect of nalmefene on foods rated as 
highly palatable. Thus the apparent nutrient specificity of nalmefene appeared 
to be an indirect consequence of its effect on palatability. Nalmefene also 
caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of 
tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for 
observed changes in eating behaviour. No other side-effects were detected, and 
performance on a choice reaction time task was unaffected. These results add 
weight to suggestions that endogenous opioids are involved in reward-related 
aspects of feeding associated with food palatability."
2319291,"A case-control study of brain tumor was conducted in collaborating hospitals in 
Boston, Providence, and Baltimore. Cases were 160 consecutive patients being 
treated for glioblastoma, grade 3 or 4 astrocytoma, or anaplastic astrocytoma. 
Controls were 128 healthy persons identified among the case's friends. A complex 
self-administered questionnaire was used to assess exposure to factors of 
interest. There was some evidence that glioblastoma is associated with a 
decreased susceptibility to allergies, a finding that may call attention to the 
involvement of immunologic disturbances in brain tumors. Our data are not 
supportive of previous reports of an association between brain tumors and 
exposure to pets or farm environment, family history of CNS malignancies or 
other neurologic conditions, or irradiation to the head. We did not find any 
evidence for an association with life-style characteristics such as cigarette 
smoking, alcohol consumption, use of drugs of any kind, or dietary intake of 
cured or smoked meat or fish."
2319581,"Sotos' syndrome, or cerebral gigantism, is a disorder of growth regulation. 
Tumours have occasionally been reported in children with Sotos' syndrome, but it 
is uncertain whether this is a coincidence, or whether it is aetiologically 
related to the underlying disorder of growth. We report a 15 month old child 
with a paraspinal neuroblastoma and Sotos' syndrome and suggest that children 
with this condition may be at higher risk for developing tumours than the 
general population."

2362805,"The human beta-globin dominant control region (DCR) which flanks the multigene 
beta-globin locus directs high level, site of integration independent, copy 
number dependent expression on a linked human beta-globin gene in transgenic 
mice and stably transfected mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We have assayed 
each of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive regions present in the full 15kb 
DCR for position independence and copy number dependence of a linked beta-globin 
gene in transgenic mice. The results show that at least three of the individual 
DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at 
lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number 
dependent expression. Site 2 alone directs the highest level of expression of 
the single site constructs, producing nearly 70% of the level of the full DCR. 
Sites 1 and 3 each provide 30% of the full activity. Deletion of either site 2 
or 3 from the complete set significantly reduces the level of expression, but 
does not effect position independence or copy number dependence. This 
demonstrates that sites 2 and 3 are required for full expression and suggests 
that all the sites are required for the full expression of even a single gene 
from this multigene locus."
2373612,"Paroxysmal haematoma of the fingers (Achenbach's syndrome) is a rarely reported 
entity. It often occurs spontaneously or subsequent to minor injuries. Because 
of the sudden onset of intense burning pain and the subsequent development of 
haematoma, the patients are frequently alarmed. The etiology is still unknown. 
We report on 3 cases of paroxysmal haematoma of the fingers. The harmless nature 
of the condition is emphasized."
2378506,"The incidence of red-green colour vision defects was studied in a sample of 392 
Basque students (174 males and 218 females), using the Ishihara test cards 
(1987). The frequency of red-green colour blindness was 4.02 percent in the 
males and 0.46 percent in the females. The colour blindness frequencies found 
among males are within the range of other Spanish samples. Nevertheless they are 
lower than the values reported in other European populations."
2384121,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether oxiracetam crosses the human 
blood-brain barrier and to evaluate its comparative kinetics in serum and in 
cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). Six DAT patients, undergoing CSF collection for 
diagnostic purposes, received 2 g oxiracetam daily, by a 60 min i.v. infusion, 
for 7 days. On the last day, in four patients blood samples were collected at 
time 0, 30, 60 and 120 min, and lumbar drainage was performed at the end of 
infusion: at this time mean CSF concentration was 3.5 micrograms/ml, i.e. 4.0% 
of the serum one, demonstrating that oxiracetam crosses the blood-brain barrier. 
In two patients, blood samples were collected at time 0, 60, 120 and 240 min, 
and lumbar drainage was performed 60 min after the end of infusion: at this time 
mean CSF concentration was 2.8 micrograms/ml, i.e. 5.3% of the serum one, 
indicating a persistence of oxiracetam within this deep compartment. These 
results provide the first evidence in humans that oxiracetam penetrates the 
central nervous system and contribute to the understanding of its long-lasting 
pharmacodynamic effect in man."
2385441,"A case of IgA (kappa type) myeloma complicated by fractures of the bones and 
hyperviscosity syndrome is presented. A 56-year-old woman who had been followed 
as an outpatient with diabetes mellitus for about 16 years, developed multiple 
myeloma. She also showed symptoms and signs of hyperviscosity syndrome; 
hemorrhagic diathesis, blurred vision and episodes of transient ischemic attacks 
of the brain, and fractures of the bones by small powers of trauma. At autopsy, 
almost all bones showed infiltration of multiple myeloma of IgA-kappa type and 
severe osteoporosis accompanied with proliferation of osteoclasts. The 
association of IgA myeloma with hyperviscosity syndrome and/or bone destruction 
was discussed. The ""serum hyperviscosity syndrome"" has been described clinically 
as the triad of bleeding, visual signs and symptoms, and neurologic 
manifestations. And this syndrome has been associated frequently with 
macroglobulinemia of Waldenström, occasionally with immunoglobulin (Ig) G 
myeloma, rarely with IgA myeloma, and with other dysproteinemia. Myeloma is also 
characterized by extensive bone destruction and is accompanied by susceptibility 
to fracture, although Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, acute leukemia or chronic 
leukemia are rarely associated with bone resorption. The present report 
describes a patient with IgA myeloma complicated by hyperviscosity syndrome and 
multiple bone fractures."
2386542,"The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium [DuP 785, NSC 368390, 
6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid 
sodium salt] inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the de 
novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of UMP. Sixty-nine 
quinoline 4-carboxylic acid analogs were analyzed as inhibitors of L1210 
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This structure-activity relationship study 
identified three critical regions of brequinar sodium and its analogs, where 
specific substitutions are required for the inhibition of the activity of 
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The three principal regions are: (i) the C(2) 
position where bulky hydrophobic substituents are necessary, (ii) the C(4) 
position which has a strict requirement for the carboxylic acid and its 
corresponding salts, and (iii) the benzo portion of the quinoline ring with 
appropriate substitutions. These results will be useful in the elucidation of 
the precise nature of the interaction between brequinar sodium and 
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase."
2388211,"Methotrexate (MTX) is currently under study for use in juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis. One complication of MTX is hepatotoxicity. Although liver function 
tests may be abnormal with its use, in this setting they do not correlate well 
with the development of hepatic fibrosis. Periodic liver biopsy is required to 
monitor for the hepatotoxic changes secondary to MTX. We describe and discuss 
the case of a 17-year-old woman who developed evidence of hepatic fibrosis after 
3 years of MTX therapy."
2397096,"The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined 
in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea 
pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol 
was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported 
for intact mitochondria. Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of 
cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact 
mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on 
CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. Furthermore, the 
same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer 
and inner mitochondrial membranes. This biosynthesis was associated with both 
the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig liver, but 
only with the inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from rat liver. The release 
of radioactive glycerol was also measured, but the amount obtained did not 
satisfy the stoichiometric requirement for CDP-diglyceride-independent 
biosynthesis of cardiolipin from 2 mol of phosphatidylglycerol with the 
liberation of 1 mol of glycerol. Therefore, it was concluded that this mechanism 
is not involved in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin in mitochondrial and 
submitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat liver."
2404771,"The peripheral lamina of eukaryotic nuclei is composed of polypeptides called 
lamins that vary in number from one to four according to organism, cell type, 
and differentiated state of the cells. Early embryonic cells and stem cells of 
mammals generally possess only lamin B while lamins A and C appear later during 
differentiation. To study the role of the late appearance of lamins A and C in 
the differentiated phenotype, we have performed transfection of cDNAs coding for 
human lamins A or C into mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines F9 and P19 
lacking these two lamins. Transient transfections have shown that lamins A or C 
could be expressed, translocated to the peripheral lamina, and distributed into 
daughter cell nuclei after mitosis. These results demonstrated that EC cells 
devoid of lamins A and C nevertheless possessed the appropriate mechanisms for 
the localization and mitotic redistribution of exogenous lamins A and C."
2412135,"The Alu sequence family comprises the major dispersed repeat sequences of rodent 
and primate genomes, numbering greater than 300,000 copies in the human haploid 
genome. The function of these elements is unknown. The sequences can be 
transcribed by RNA polymerase III and represent a substantial fraction of total 
heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Alu sequences can be found both in the flanking 
regions and within the transcription units of several well-characterized genes. 
Here we show that some members of the mouse B1 Alu sequence family encode a 
small cytoplasmic RNA. The mouse B1 sequence is congruent to 130 nucleotides 
long and shows homology with the monomeric units of the dimeric 300-nucleotide 
primate sequence. By means of microinjection studies in the Xenopus laevis 
oocyte, we have elucidated a novel pathway leading to the appearance of a 
processed B1-type Alu RNA species in the cytoplasm. The abundance of this small 
Alu RNA differs between various mouse tissues, suggesting a role in 
tissue-specific gene expression."
2413151,"Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent that causes a dose-related lung fibrosis 
that limits its therapeutic effectiveness. It has been proposed that the 
cellular toxicity and antitumor effects of bleomycin occur by formation of 
O2-Fe(II)-bleomycin complexes that degrade DNA and release O2- and OH radicals 
that attack other cellular components. Twice daily injections of the iron 
chelator deferoxamine were utilized in an attempt to ameliorate 
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. They failed to diminish bleomycin-induced lung 
inflammation and fibrosis in rats."
2414683,"Cathinone is an active ingredient in the leaves of the Khat shrub. Cathinone 
affects behavior, neurochemistry and electrophysiology in a manner similar to 
the stimulants amphetamine, cocaine and methylphenidate. The present study 
extended these studies by evaluating the effects of (+/-)cathinone on dopamine 
(DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing neurons in several regions of the 
rat brain in vivo. An index of the rate of synthesis of DA and 5-HT in vivo was 
determined in the nuclei caudatus putamen (CP), accumbens (NA), amygdaloideus 
centralis (AC), septi lateralis (SL), preopticus pars suprachiasmatica (PSCN) 
and dorsomedialis (hypothalami; DMN) of male rats (175-225 g) by measuring the 
concentration of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 
after the administration of NSD 1015 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) an inhibitor of aromatic 
L-amino acid decarboxylase. Concentrations of DA, 5-HT and their major 
metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
(5-HIAA), respectively, were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography 
coupled to an electrochemical detector. Cathinone decreased levels of DOPAC in a 
time- and dose-related manner in the caudatus putamen, accumbens, amygdaloideus 
centralis and septi lateralis with the peak effect occurring 30-60 min after a 
dose of 6 mg/kg (i.p.). Cathinone had no effect on DOPAC in the preopticus pars 
suprachiasmatica or dorsomedialis (hypothalami). The drug also decreased the 
accumulation of DOPA in the caudatus putamen, accumbens, amygdaloideus centralis 
and septi lateralis, but in the preopticus pars suprachiasmatica and 
dorsomedialis (hypothalami), there was no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

2415378,"The nuclear lamina consists of a proteinaceous layer or meshwork situated 
subjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. It is a karyoskeletal structure formed 
by a polymer containing one to three major polypeptides collectively termed the 
lamins. In all cells examined of vertebrates and invertebrates, the lamins 
exhibit very similar Mr ranging from 60 000 to 80 000. In vertebrates, two 
groups of lamins can be distinguished by their isoelectric value, one being 
near-neutral and the other acidic (isoelectric pH values of 5.6 and lower). The 
lamins represent a family of polypeptides with regions highly conserved during 
evolution. In certain species, e.g., the amphibian, Xenopus laevis, they exhibit 
cell type-specific expression during embryonic development, terminal 
differentiation of certain somatic cells, and gametogenesis. The nuclear lamina 
of diverse cell types can be composed of one, two or three different lamin 
polypeptides, without obvious differences in its morphology."
2415514,"Cloned human apo-C-II cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to identify the 
human apo-C-II gene in a genomic library constructed in our laboratory. The 
isolated apo-C-II DNA was studied both by electron microscopy and by direct 
sequence analysis. Ultrastructural morphological analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids 
revealed that the apo-C-II gene had complex structures because of regions of 
inverted complementary sequences in and around the gene forming stem-and-loop 
structures which interfere with the formation of stable RNA:DNA hybrids. 
Extensive morphological analysis revealed a minimum of 3 intervening sequences 
(IVS), and their lengths were measured. Direct sequence analysis of the cloned 
gene confirmed the presence of 3 IVS. There are 4 Alu type sequences in IVS-I. 
We sequenced 4340 nucleotides which include 545 nucleotides in the 5' flanking 
region, the entire gene which spans 3320 nucleotides, and 475 nucleotides in the 
3' flanking region which also encompasses an additional Alu sequence. The 5' end 
of the gene was identified by primer extension and sequencing of the primer 
extended cDNA. Apo-C-II mRNA structure was deduced from the cDNA sequence, the 
primer extension experiments, and the genomic sequence. It is 494 nucleotides in 
length. Its sequence differs from previously published sequences in that there 
are 7 additional nucleotides before the polyadenylate tail. In the 5' flanking 
region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high 
homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the 
apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I 
(approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately 
-116 to -103). This highly conserved region might represent some evolutionarily 
conserved sequences from these related genes and/or might represent a region 
with regulatory function."
2415825,"The human genome is rich in sequences which are structurally related to the 7SL 
RNA component of the signal recognition particle. The 7SL DNA sequence family 
consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes (which are truncated at one or 
both ends of the 7SL sequence) and 500,000 Alu sequences. Both 7SL genes and Alu 
elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the 
internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then 
does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while 
transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable? 
We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are 
expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu 
element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL 
gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37 
nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for 
efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic 
sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain 
this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be 
transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family 
within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences 
between mammalian Alu families."
2425242,"Pulmonary fibrosis is the major toxic effect of bleomycin chemotherapy; however, 
the molecular mechanisms of the pathological process are unknown. Since alveolar 
macrophages produce toxic oxygen metabolites and these can damage lung cells, 
the effect of bleomycin on superoxide anion production was investigated in 
subpopulations of pig alveolar macrophages. Cells were lavaged from the lung and 
separated into three subpopulations according to their density. Their capacity 
to generate superoxide anions increased the more distally they were located. 
Bleomycin (5.0 milliunits/ml) increased the rate of superoxide production by 75 
+/- 24% in dense alveolar macrophages located in the lung periphery. 
Hydrocortisone (10.0 micrograms/ml) inhibited this superoxide production by 33 
+/- 10%. Results from this study suggest that an excess production of superoxide 
anions by alveolar macrophages may be the underlying cause of bleomycin 
pulmonary toxicity."
2426412,"The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from 
measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the 
concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of 
accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic 
L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation 
of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., pargyline). 
The purpose of the present study was to compare these different methods under 
conditions of changing neuronal impulse traffic produced by electrical 
stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons. Male rats anesthetized with 
chloral hydrate were killed following 0, 15, or 30 min of electrical stimulation 
of the dorsal raphe nucleus at a frequency of 0, 5, or 10 Hz. The concentrations 
of 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan in 
nucleus accumbens, amygdala, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus 
were measured using HPLC coupled to an electrochemical detector. In each brain 
region, stimulation elicited an increase in the concentration of 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid/5-hydroxytryptamine concentration ratio in saline-treated animals and an 
increase in 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation in NSD 1015-treated animals, but 
did not alter the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid in pargyline-treated rats. The results o f this study indicate that 
although the first three methods serve as valid indices of 
5-hydroxytryptaminergic neuronal activity, the pargyline-dependent techniques 
are not responsive to changes in the rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine nerve firing."
2427537,"Adrenal medullary cells in adult primates contain catecholamines and several 
neuropeptides. Among these peptides are several products of the three opiate 
precursor proteins: proenkephalin, prodynorphin, and proopiomelanocortin. We 
used immunocytochemistry to study the ontogeny of leu-enkephalin and the 
catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes dopamine beta-hydroxylase and 
phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in adjacent sections of 14 fetal rhesus 
and 31 fetal human adrenal glands. The adrenal medulla of a 24-week-old human 
fetus as well as medullas of 11 134- to 172-day-old rhesus fetuses were 
immunopositive with all 3 antisera employed. Furthermore, in thin serial 
sections of these glands, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, phenylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase, and leu-enkephalin appeared to be colocalized in the same 
cells of the adrenal medulla. Twenty-six adrenals from fetuses 15-26 weeks 
stained lightly with one or more of the antisera. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase 
could be detected at 15 weeks, followed by leu-enkephalin and phenylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase at 18-19 weeks. The role of the enkephalins during fetal 
life or in the adaptation to extrauterine life is not yet clear. In adults, 
enkephalins are cosecreted with catecholamines in response to stress. Our 
results suggest that the fetal adrenal may be capable of cosecretion of 
catecholamines and enkephalins, at least by the end of the second trimester of 
gestation."
2428004,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of thyroid hormone on 
tension development and the intracellular calcium transient in mammalian 
ventricular muscle. A hyperthyroid (H) state was induced in ferrets by 
subcutaneous injection of L-thyroxine, 0.3 mg/kg daily, for 2-3 weeks. One-half 
of the age matched control group (C) were injected with vehicle. Aequorin was 
loaded into the cells of ferret papillary muscles by a chemical procedure. The 
muscles were stimulated at 0.33 Hz and isometric tension and the calcium 
transient were simultaneously recorded at 30 degrees C. Peak isometric tension 
in mN/mm2 (+/- SD) was 15.4 +/- 7.2 and 16.2 +/- 7.9 for C (n = 8) and H (n = 9) 
respectively. The time to peak tension and time to 80% relaxation from peak of 
tension were reduced by 22% and 28% respectively in H compared to C. After 
stimulation, the calcium transient reached a maximum in 56 +/- 6 ms in C and in 
47 +/- 5 ms in H. The time to 80% decay of the peak calcium transient was 95 +/- 
8 ms and 68 +/- 5 ms for C and H respectively. The ratio of the aequorin 
luminescence at the peak of the calcium transient over the calculated maximum 
luminescence, Lmax, were compared and they were not different. At 22 degrees C 
Log (L/Lmax) was -3.3 +/- 0.1 in C (n = 4) and -3.4 +/- 0.3 in H (n = 3). These 
results indicate that the thyroid state influences the time course of the 
calcium transient and are consistent with the abbreviation in the duration of 
contraction that is observed in the hyperthyroid state."
2431391,"Phycobilisomes, the major light-harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria are 
multimolecular structures made up of chromophoric proteins called 
phycobiliproteins and non chromophoric linker polypeptides. We report here the 
isolation and nucleotide sequence of the genes, cpeA and cpeB, which in 
Calothrix PCC 7601 encode the alpha and beta subunits of phycoerythrin, one of 
the major phycobiliproteins. In Calothrix PCC 7601, modulation of the 
polypeptide composition of the phycobilisomes occurs in response to changes of 
the light wavelength, a phenomenon known as complementary chromatic adaptation. 
Under green illumination, cells synthesize phycoerythrin and its two 
specifically associated linker polypeptides (LR35 and LR36), while under red 
illumination none of these proteins are detected. Using specific probes, a 
single transcript (1450 nucleotide long) corresponding to the cpe genes was 
detected but only in green-light-grown cells, establishing the occurrence of 
transcriptional regulation for the expression of this operon in response to 
light wavelength changes. The size of this transcript excludes the possibility 
that the phycoerythrin-associated LR35 and LR36 could be cotranscribed with the 
cpeA and cpeB genes."
2438879,"A study was undertaken to determine whether the skin eruption of linear IgA 
disease (LAD) was gluten dependent. Six patients with LAD were treated with a 
gluten free diet (GFD) for an average period of 33 months (range 19-48). 
Although one patient with LAD had an enteropathy which was clearly gluten 
sensitive, there was no convincing evidence that the rash of any of the patients 
responded to a GFD. Four of the six patients showed no significant alteration in 
their drug requirements. The remaining 2 patients showed a fall in minimum drug 
requirement but there was no increase after gluten challenge indicating that 
they were entering spontaneous remission. This contrasts to the situation in 
dermatitis herpetiformis, where both the rash and the enteropathy are gluten 
dependent. These data add further to the evidence that LAD and dermatitis 
herpetiformis are separate entities."
2443992,"Pulmonary toxicity is an important adverse effect of bleomycin treatment. Very 
little is known of the mechanisms underlying the development of lung injury, 
especially after intravenous administration, or how it can be modulated. In this 
study acute lung injury induced by bleomycin has been examined in rats by 
assessment of alveolar lavage cell profiles, histological examination, and 
measurement of the total pulmonary extravascular albumin space. Intratracheal 
instillation of bleomycin 1.5 mg resulted in a severe pneumonitis with influx of 
inflammatory cells into the alveoli as assessed by alveolar lavage, oedema of 
the alveolar walls, and up to an eight fold increase in the total pulmonary 
extravascular albumin space, maximal at 72 hours. Intravenous bleomycin 0.15-5 
mg produced no detectable injury when assessed in these ways. Exposure to 
hyperoxia (40-90%) after intravenous bleomycin, however, induced lung injury 
similar to that produced by intratracheal bleomycin. A much more severe injury 
followed administration of intravenous bleomycin after an exposure to hyperoxia, 
which itself resulted in lung injury; but lung injury was still detectable after 
bleomycin when the exposure to hyperoxia was insufficient to induce changes in 
control animals. Lung injury was not observed when the exposure to hyperoxia 
preceded bleomycin treatment. These results indicate the importance of oxygen in 
the pathways leading to acute lung injury following intravenous bleomycin. We 
conclude that exposure to oxygen might induce lung injury during and after 
bleomycin treatment, and suggest that in these circumstances oxygen therapy 
should be kept to a minimum."
2449257,"Prompted by recent reports of the increasing incidence of late relapses in Stage 
1 patients with both malignant teratoma and seminoma on surveillance, a low 
toxicity regimen combining etoposide, bleomycin and cisplatin [EBCi(3)] with 
prolonged infusion of bleomycin, given daily for 3 days, has been developed for 
possible use as adjuvant treatment. Forty of 44 patients treated remain free of 
disease with a median follow-up of 21 months and actuarial disease free survival 
at 2 years of 91%. There have been no respiratory problems attributable to 
bleomycin lung toxicity in this study compared with four (3 associated with 
patient deaths) seen in 91 previously treated patients. The relatively low 
toxicity and high efficacy of this regime indicate that it may be suitable as 
adjuvant treatment."
2491777,"The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the 
pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational 
families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of 
the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes 
including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and 
D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202 
demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95% 
confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered 
as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal 
diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most 
likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order 
was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In 
addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are 
four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease 
gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci. 
When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these 
individuals are heterozygous is 85%."
2491780,"Nine markers from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 were typed in 16 
British and five South African families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The 
markers--p17H8, pHHH202, and EW204--were linked to NF1 at recombination 
fractions less than 1%. No evidence of locus heterogeneity was detected. 
Inspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers 
suggests that the NF1 gene is located between the markers EW301 (cen-p11.2) and 
EW206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to pHHH202 (q11.2-q12)."
2491782,"The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been 
mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize 
the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on 
11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The 
markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206), 
D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found 
between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero. 
One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10% 
recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or 
between HOX-2 and growth hormone. Our data are consistent with the proposed gene

International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint 
analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain 
precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the 
closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. With specimens from 142 
families and more than 700 affected persons, eight teams used 31 markers in the 
pericentric region of chromosome 17 to perform 13,838 genotypings. With the 
combined data, we used the computer program CRI-MAP to build the most likely 
sequence of loci by sequentially adding single loci to a fixed pair of loci and 
separately calculating the likelihood of all permutations of four consecutive 
loci. The best order is pter-pA10-41-EW301-centromere 
(p17H8)-pHHH202-NF1-EW206-EW207-EW203++ +-CRI-L581-CRI-L946-HOX2-NGFR-qter. The 
total genetic distance from pA10-41 to NGFR is 26 cM in males and 56 cM in 
females, and the overall difference in sex-specific maps is statistically 
significant (P = .006). The upper 99% confidence limits of the recombination 
fraction of the closest proximal marker, pHHH202, is 4%, and that for the 
closest distal marker, EW206, is 9%. These limits should decrease with the use 
of additional probes and the further evaluation of DNA from the six persons 
showing multiple recombinations within short genetic distances. Clinical 
application is technically feasible with currently available markers, although 
its appropriate use for prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis requires further 
discussion and evaluation."

Subluxation of C1 on C2 has also been documented in patients with Type I and 
Type IV MPS. Routine screening of the cervical spine is recommended in patients 
with ""MPS Type VII"" so that delayed diagnosis of instability, which may lead to 
neurologic compromise, is avoided."
2492650,"An increase in cocaine abuse by pregnant women has been associated with a range 
of maternal/fetal cardiovascular complications. Intracerebral hemorrhage has 
been reported as a cocaine-related complication, but has not previously been

2497684,"The results of the various studies and an analysis of the methodology are 
presented in TABLE 1. As can be seen, there was no ""perfect"" study. In five of 
the studies enough information was presented with regard to the measurements and 
the behavior of control patients that a statistical analysis could be performed. 
Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at 
least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used 
TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the 
effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response. The cause of 
this response, however, has not been documented, and whether it is associated 
with an effect of the drug on the disease process remains to be seen."
2497685,"The critical points that must be addressed in evaluating ergotropic drugs are 
exemplified by the current morass of positive and negative results that have 
been obtained in clinical investigations of TRH or its analogues. Appropriate 
subject selection is crucial. These patients may have bulbar symptoms, and those 
features of ALS should be specifically assayed for treatment effects relative to 
placebo. Gender-specific effects of TRH need to be accounted for in study 
design. In addition, electrophysiological techniques such as single fiber 
density may help determine the responsiveness of patients to TRH or its 
analogues. The clinical significance of an increase in fiber density following 
TRH or other drugs should be determined, as it will provide insight into the 
state of motor neurons in the spinal cord of patients with ALS and possibly 
could be important in determining those who may respond to TRH if such a 
response is possible. Clinical studies have quite clearly shown conflicting 
results. Basic studies, however, have shown that response to TRH is state 
dependent, that is, whether the patient is male or female. Clinical studies have 
shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether 
the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies 
must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the 
pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues."
2499679,"Cytogenetic re-evaluation of a fibroblast cell line from a female Hunter's 
syndrome case with a balanced X;autosome translocation, which had previously 
been reported to have a breakpoint in Xq26 to Xq27, showed the breakpoint to be 
either between Xq27 and Xq28 or within Xq28. The normal X chromosome was 
preferentially inactivated, supporting the view that the translocation had 
disrupted the Hunter gene. The new localisation is now in full agreement with 
our previous linkage work and other published data. Results of further linkage 
studies using probes defining the loci DXS86, DXS144, DXS100, DXS102, DXS105, 
F8C, and DXS134 are also consistent with our original conclusion that the Hunter 
locus lies within the distal region of the X chromosome long arm."
2499883,"The Bacillus subtilis dnaF (polC) gene that codes for the alpha subunit of the 
DNA polymerase III holoenzyme has been sequenced. It consists of 4005 base pairs 
coding for 1335 amino acids (from the start to the stop codon), giving a 
molecular weight of 151,273. A mutation (azp-12) that confers resistance to the 
antimicrobial drug 6-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)-uracil is due to a single base change 
at nucleotide 3523, from TCA to GCA, resulting in a change of the 1175th amino 
acid, serine, to alanine. It is in the active site and located at the C-terminal 
part of the enzyme. The amino acid composition in an N-terminal domain has 26% 
homology to the epsilon subunit coded by the dnaQ gene of Escherichia coli, 
which is a 3'----5' proofreading exonuclease, supporting an earlier observation 
that this function is an integral part of the polymerase molecule in B.

2502578,"Allophycocyanin (APC) belongs to a family of phycobiliproteins that are well 
suited as fluorescent reagents for flow cytometric analysis, since they have a 
broad excitation spectrum, a large Stoke's shift and they fluoresce with a high 
quantum yield. The widespread use of APC has been limited by the availability of 
raw material and high cost of the purified phycobiliprotein. We have assessed 
the suitability of dry, powdered Spirulina platensis, available at health food 
stores, as an inexpensive source of APC. APC was extracted from Spirulina 
platensis by overnight treatment with lysozyme, followed by ammonium sulfate 
precipitation. APC was then separated from phycocyanin (the only other major 
phycobiliprotein in Spirulina) by elution of bound material from an 
hydroxylapatite column using an increasing continuous phosphate gradient. APC 
isolated in this manner retained its normal trimeric structure. The absorbance 
and fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the purified 
phycobiliproteins were identical to those previously shown for C-PC and APC. APC 
can be stored concentrated at 4 degrees C, frozen at -70 degrees C, or as a 
saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate, with no subunit dissociation or change 
in spectral properties. Moreover, APC has been conjugated to monoclonal and 
polyclonal antibodies for use in multicolor FACS analysis, with the conjugated 
antibody activity remaining stable for at least 2 years. Thus, this procedure is 
a simple, cost-effective method for preparing reagents for multicolor 
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry."
2504890,"In this phase II trial, 105 eligible patients with no prior chemotherapy and 
advanced sarcoma received doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (DTIC) with 
mesna uroprotection (MAID). Starting doses of these drugs were 60, 7,500, and 
900 mg/m2 divided over 72 hours by continuous infusion, respectively. Mesna was 
given for 84 to 96 hours at 2,500 mg/m2/d. Myelosuppression was dose limiting, 
causing the only toxic death (sepsis). Nonhematologic toxicity consisted 
predominantly of anorexia and vomiting. Severe mucositis, macroscopic hematuria, 
renal tubular acidosis, renal failure, and CNS toxicity occurred in less than 5% 
of cycles. No cardiotoxicity was detected. The overall response rate (10% 
complete response [CR]) was 47% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 18% and 37% to 
57%, respectively). Most responses (approximately 70%) were observed within two 
cycles. Median times to progression were 10 and 9 months, respectively. 
Histologic high tumor grade, lesions less than 5 cm, and less than 1 year from 
diagnosis to study entry correlated with the probability of response. The median 
survival was 16 months. Time from diagnosis to study entry, performance status, 
and extent of disease, but not histologic grade, correlated with survival. 
Following CR, two patients remain disease-free at 32 and 16 months. Of the 15 
additional patients rendered disease-free with surgery, two remain disease-free 
at 30 and 18 months with no further therapy. While most relapses occurred in 
sites of prior involvement, death from CNS metastases occurred in 11 of the 80 
patients with high-grade sarcomas, of whom seven were still responding 
systematically (three complete responders). Because of its substantial response 
in this phase II trial, the MAID regimen is being compared with doxorubicin and 
DTIC alone in advanced sarcomas and to observation in the adjuvant treatment of 
high-grade sarcomas in randomized trials."
2505416,"The zeste locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding protein that 
can influence transcription. A number of sites recognized by this protein fall 
within genes associated with transvection, a phenomenon suggesting a form of 
gene regulation that is responsive to the proximity of a gene to its homologous 
allele on another chromosome. These recent observations continue a history of 
studies concerning zeste and transvection which has inspired molecular models 
linking chromosome structure and positioning to the modulation of gene 
expression."
2510609,"Eighty measurements of plasma creatinine concentration, height:creatinine ratio,

simultaneous measurements of glomerular filtration rate using plasma clearance 
of 51Cr edetic acid to assess the performance of each test as an initial 
screening procedure of renal insufficiency. Height:creatinine index less than 
2.1 was found to have a higher sensitivity and predictive value of a normal

procedure."
2510913,"A scanning electron microscope study has enabled an explanation as to why the 
brown-tail moth provokes Lepidopterism. The brown-tail moth only provokes 
Lepidopterism via a transmission of the urticating hairs of its caterpillar. 
Urticating moths (genus Hylesia and Anaphae) protect their eggs and young 
caterpillars with urticating hairs, thus it is very ambiguous to label erucism 
as the contact dermatitis produced by caterpillar production or Lepidopterism as 
the contact dermatitis caused by moth urticating hairs."

weeks previously and developed a swimmers' itch. Ova of Schistosoma mansoni was 
demonstrated by the formol-ether concentration method of the faeces. An initial 
single dose (40 mg/kg) of praziquantel with prednisolone 40 mg once daily for 5

safe and beneficial to give corticosteroid with chemotherapy in acute 
schistosomiasis (Katayama fever)."
2513155,"Oculomotor disorders have been considered to be one of the negative symptoms in 
motor neuron disease (MND). However, recently, ophthalmoplegia, abnormal Bell's

52.4 +/- 10.1 years) by bedside examination and electro-oculography (EOG) using 
an eye tracking method. Twenty-three of them were classified as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and seven as bulbospinal muscular atrophy, and two were 
unclassified. One hundred healthy persons for bedside examination and twenty-two 
for EOG were investigated as controls. Findings by bedside examinations were as 
follows; 1) Slight limitations of upward only, up & downward and upward & 
horizontal gaze were observed in 5 cases (15.6%), 1 case (3.1%) and 1 case 
(3.1%), respectively. 2) Incomplete convergence was observed in 11 cases. 
(34.4%) 3) Horizontal gaze nystagmus was observed in 6 cases. (18.8%) 4) As 
regards the frequency of limitation of upward gaze and incomplete convergence, 
there were no statistically significant differences from those in controls. 
Electrooculographic results were: 1) square wave jerks (SWJs) were recorded in 3 
cases. (9.4%) 2) Amplitude ratio of saccade was significantly higher in MND than 
that in controls with the risk less than 0.1%. 3) The degree of ocular dysmetria 
was significantly higher in MND than that in controls with the risk less than 
0.5%. These abnormalities were not directly related to suffering period.

2513486,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the murine immunoglobulin gamma 2a 
membrane 3' untranslated region (1413 nucleotides) and approximately 679 
nucleotides of downstream sequence. Two AATAAA hexanucleotide sequences are 
present in the 2092 nucleotide interval. The first one functions as the major 
polyA signal, directing cleavage and polyadenylation at a site 20 nucleotides 
downstream. Within 41 nucleotides downstream of the major membrane polyA signal 
are two sequences with 75% homology to the consensus sequence, 
(C/T)GTGTT(C/T)(C/T), identified by McLauchlan et al. [Nucl. Acids Res. 13, 
1347-1365 (1985)]. An 80% homology match to the Berget consensus sequence, 
CA(C/T)TG, begins five nucleotides 3' of the major polyA site (used 20 times 
more than the second, downstream polyA site) [Berget Nature 309, 179-182 
(1984)]. The second AATAAA, located 73 nucleotides 3' of the first, directs 
cleavage and polyadenylation 18 nucleotides downstream at a minor polyA site. 
One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17 
nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site. No matches to the Berget 
consensus sequence are located near this second, weaker polyA site."

flexor plantar reflex after injection, probably due to disproportionate increase 
in tone of the calf muscles. No significant changes in F-waves or H-reflexes 
were seen. No increase in useful voluntary strength, or in strength measured by 
Medical Research Council (MRC) testing or strain gauge isometric strength 
testing was seen. However, dyspnea was seen within 10 minutes of TRH injection."
2514275,"alpha-neurotoxins from elapid snake venoms and alpha-conotoxins from marine 
snails bind specifically and with high affinity to nicotinic cholinoceptors. 
Although both types of toxin are polypeptides, there is more than a fourfold 
difference in size between the two and no clear sequence homology is evident. A 
systematic computer search of the three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b 
(an alpha-neurotoxin from the false sea snake Laticauda semifasciata) was 
performed to identify the locality that most closely matched the amino acid 
compositions of the smaller alpha-conotoxins (from the marine snails Conus magus 
and Conus geographus). The area of greatest similarity centered on residue 
position 25 of erabutoxin b, a locale that is conserved throughout the snake 
alpha-neurotoxins and their homologues. Six proteins unrelated to erabutoxin b 
were compared to the alpha-conotoxins to show that the extent of the erabutoxin 
b/alpha-conotoxin match was too high to be coincidental. Homologues of 
erabutoxin b, namely alpha-cobratoxin from Naja naja siamensis and cytotoxin 
VII4 from Naja mossambica mossambica, were also analyzed. The extent of the 
matching with the alpha-conotoxins decreased in the series erabutoxin b greater 
than alpha-cobratoxin greater than cytotoxin VII4, and this also relates the 
order of similarity to the pharmacological properties of the alpha-conotoxins. 
The alpha-conotoxin-like area of the snake alpha-neurotoxins is peripheral to 
the site previously considered important for binding to the cholinoceptor, even 
though it seems to represent the focus of evolutionary convergence between the 
two types of neurotoxin. The area of resemblance does, however, have strong 
associations with the conformational behavior of the snake toxins. Hence, the 
outcome of this study has important consequences for the current ideas on snake 
alpha-neurotoxin structure/activity relationships and the evolutionary origins 
of neurotoxicity."
2515622,"The best therapeutic approach to acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is still 
unsettled. In this paper we report a synergistic effect between schistosomicides 
and steroids in the treatment of the early stages of Schistosoma mansoni 
infection in the mouse. CBA mice infected with 150 S. mansoni cercariae were 
treated with oxamniquine or praziquantel and dexamethasone or prednisolone. The 
rate of parasite egg excretion by treated mice and appropriate controls was 
monitored, and the mice were perfused 43 d after infection for estimation of 
worm burdens and tissue egg densities. Mice treated with schistosomicides alone 
or with schistosomicides plus steroids had worm burdens of similar size. 
Significant reductions in egg counts were, however, recorded in faeces, and in 
the intestines and livers (with consequent reduction in liver pathology), of 
mice treated with schistosomicide and steroid, when compared to mice treated 
with schistosomicide alone or steroid alone. The apparent inhibition of 
fecundity of S. mansoni by combining these drugs has clear implications for 
treatment of the Katayama syndrome."

2520442,"Headache is the most common complaint encountered in clinical practice. 
Approximately 45 million people in the United States experience chronic 
headaches. The management of migraine headache involves both pharmacologic and 
nondrug therapy. Drug therapy for migraine involves the use of abortive and 
prophylactic agents. Abortive agents, such as ergotamine tartrate and 
ketoprofen, may be used to relieve the acute attack. Prophylactic therapy is 
focused on reducing the frequency and severity of the attacks. beta-Adrenergic 
blocking agents, such as propranolol, remain the primary agents for many 
migraine patients, although other drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), including ketoprofen, or calcium-channel blocking agents, such 
as verapamil, may be beneficial for many patients. For cluster headache and its 
variants, methysergide and corticosteroids are usually the drugs of choice. 
Patients with chronic cluster headache may achieve good results from long-term 
treatment with other therapies, including lithium carbonate, verapamil, and 
ketoprofen."

2523644,"One hundred eighteen patients, aged between 65 and 87 years with 
mild-to-moderate hypertension were given placebo or isradipine (1.25 to 5 mg 
twice daily, or 2.5 to 10 mg once daily) following a three-week placebo period 
to evaluate its safety and efficacy in elderly patients. Dosage step-up was at 
three-week intervals. Blood pressure measurements were taken immediately before 
the morning dose (12 to 24 hours after the previous dose). At the end of the 
study, both supine and standing diastolic blood pressures were significantly 
lower with isradipine than with placebo. A 10-mm Hg reduction in supine 
diastolic blood pressure was achieved with once-daily isradipine in 65 percent 
and with twice-daily isradipine in 52 percent of patients, indicating sustained 
blood pressure control over the dose interval (12 to 24 hours). Adverse events 
were usually mild, transient, and typical for vasodilators. Isradipine did not 
produce more laboratory, clinical, or electrocardiographic abnormalities than 
did placebo. In conclusion, isradipine either once or twice daily at doses 
between 2.5 and 10 mg is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for 
mild-to-moderate hypertension in elderly patients."
2523646,"A total of 152 patients with essential hypertension (World Health Organization 
classification I/II) entered a multicenter randomized study to assess the safety 
and efficacy of isradipine compared with, and in combination with, the 
beta-blocker atenolol. After a three-week placebo treatment period, patients 
received either isradipine (2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg twice daily) or atenolol (50 
or 100 mg once daily) for seven weeks. Patients who did not have an adequate 
response (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) with the maximal doses of 
single-drug therapy were given a combination of both drugs for a further seven 
weeks. Both drugs resulted in significant and clinically relevant reductions in 
blood pressures. Although the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was the same 
for patients receiving the two drugs, there was a statistically significant 
greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in the isradipine group, suggesting 
that this drug has a more favorable effect on vascular impedance. Of the 14 
patients who did not attain normal blood pressure levels (sitting diastolic 
blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) receiving monotherapy, 12 patients reached 
this goal with a combination of the two drugs."
2526450,"The role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on jejunal net fluid transport was 
studied in intact rats as well as in rats subjected to a perivascular 
denervation of the intestinal segment. In rats with intact nerves, an acute 
volume expansion with 5% albumin (10% of estimated blood volume) decreased 
jejunal net fluid absorption by approximately 70% compared to control animals 
not subjected to volume expansion. After a perivascular denervation of the 
intestinal segment, the acute volume expansion reversed net fluid absorption 
into a net fluid secretion. In order to reduce the volume expansion-induced 
endogenous release of ANP, one group of rats was subjected to a right atrial 
appendectomy 7 days prior to the experiments. In these animals, the intestinal 
response to the same 10% volume load was blunted compared to controls. 
Administration of rat alpha-ANP (99-126; 5 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) induced effects 
similar to those of volume expansion both in rats with intact perivascular 
nerves as well as in denervated animals. Volume expansion increased mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) as well as central venous pressure and decreased heart 
rate (HR) in all groups. When exogenous ANP was administered, a fall in MAP was 
seen, while HR remained unchanged. In conclusion, these data strongly indicate a 
physiological role for ANP in jejunal fluid transfer in response to acute volume 
expansion."
2530972,"The effects of thyroxine-stimulated hypertrophy (TSH) were studied in the 
porcine left ventricular myocardium. Hypertrophy was produced in six adult pigs 
by administration of triiodothyronine (1 mg/kg; i.v.) for eight days. Six pigs 
served as controls. The degree of hypertrophy, determined by left 
ventricular-to-body weight ratio, was 47%. With hypertrophy there was a 
significant increase in heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial blood flows. 
Minimal coronary resistance measured during adenosine infusion was lower in the 
TSH group compared with the control group. Anatomic studies revealed a balanced 
proliferative response of mitochondria, myofibrils and the t-tubular system 
during TSH. Analysis of the microvasculature indicated that the capillary and 
arteriolar beds both experienced growth which paralleled myocyte growth during 
TSH. These results suggest that thyroxine administration promotes angiogenesis 
in the microvascular bed which provides a partial anatomic rationale for the 
lowered minimal coronary resistance."
2533403,"Bertolotti's syndrome refers to the association of back pain with lumbosacral 
transitional vertebrae. Such vertebrae were observed in 140 of 2,000 adults with 
back pain over a 4-year period of study. Each patient had radiographic 
evaluation of the lumbar spine by plain films as well as a sectional imaging 
modality (magnetic resonance [MR] or computed tomography [CT]). The overall 
incidence of structural pathology (eg, spinal stenosis and disc protrusion) 
detected by CT or MR was not apparently higher in patients with transitional 
vertebrae, but the distribution of these lesions was significantly different. 
Disc bulge or herniation, when it occurred, was nearly nine times more common at 
the interspace immediately above the transitional vertebra than at any other 
level. Spinal stenosis and nerve root canal stenosis were more common at or near 
the interspace above the transitional vertebra than at any other level. 
Degenerative change at the articulation between the transverse process of the 
transitional vertebra and the pelvis was an uncommon occurrence; when seen there 
was no significant correlation with the reported side of pain. It is postulated 
that hypermobility and altered stresses become concentrated in the spine at the 
level immediately above a lumbar transitional vertebra. Accelerated disc and 
facet joint degeneration at this level may then result."
2534509,"In this presentation, I present evidence indicating a direct action of thyroid 
hormone at the level of the plasma membrane. Characteristically, the plasma 
membrane-mediated effects of thyroid hormones are prompt in onset, independent 
of new protein synthesis, and are associated with changes in the transmembrane 
transport of ions and substrates. The presence of specific binding sites for 
thyroid hormone in plasma membrane of various tissues and species, although 
inconclusive in itself, provides additional support for the direct action of 
thyroid hormone on the plasma membrane. A model for the mechanism of action of 
thyroid hormone at the plasma membrane level to increase sugar uptake by rat 
thymocytes is delineated, and the physiological role of the plasma 
membrane-mediated action of thyroid hormone is discussed."

2536704,"Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II 
inhibitor. Previous work has indicated that the most stable conformation for 
amiloride is a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic structure. To determine 
whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA 
topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, 
we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs. These 
analogs contained structural modifications which could be expected to allow or 
impede formation of a cyclized conformation. Empirical assays consisting of 
biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as 
computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine 
conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they 
intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II. Specifically, we measured 
the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of 
DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic 
activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase 
II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA 
topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs 
capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. 
Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into 
DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in 
a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation."
2537142,"Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II 
(topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation 
hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of 
eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator 
amsacrine (mAMSA)]. To study such relationships, various SV40- and Epstein-Barr 
Virus-transformed human cell lines derived from normal, A-T, or UV-sensitive 
xeroderma pigmentosum donors have been assayed for their sensitivity to mAMSA 
together with direct and indirect measurements of topoisomerase II expression. 
We report on the identification of an SV40-transformed A-T fibroblast cell line 
with abnormally high levels of topoisomerase II in nuclear protein extracts as 
determined by immunoblotting, measurement of kinetoplast DNA decatenation 
activity, and mAMSA-dependent DNA-protein cross-linking activity in a filter 
binding assay. Using a flow cytometric assay for the analysis of reactivity of 
nuclei with a polyclonal antitopoisomerase II antibody, overproduction was found 
to occur in all phases of the cell cycle. High levels of topoisomerase II were 
associated with hypersensitivity (5-10-fold) to mAMSA-induced cell cycle delay, 
cell kill, and DNA strand breakage (assayed under protein-denaturing 
conditions). Xeroderma pigmentosum (group A) cells demonstrated normal responses 
to mAMSA. The results provide evidence that cellular potential for the 
generation of topoisomerase II-dependent DNA damage is a major factor in 
governing the sensitivity to mAMSA. Furthermore, underexpression of 
topoisomerase II does not appear to be a primary factor in describing the in 
vitro A-T phenotype. The findings also relate to how changes in chromatin 
structure and function may either reflect or dictate the expression of 
topoisomerase II in human cells."
2539381,"Calcium-dependent protease (CANP, Calpain) is an intracellular protease involved 
in essential cellular functions mediated by calcium. To understand the mechanism 
regulating the expression of CANP at the transcriptional level, we isolated a 
human gene for the large subunit of mCANP (CANP mL) and analyzed its 5'-region. 
The transcription initiation sites were mapped to multiple positions (-142 to 
-103, A of initiation ATG as +1). The upstream region lacks typical promoter 
elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes and is characterized by its high GC content 
(-300 to -20, 70% GC content). Functional analyses of the 5'-region by a 
transient expression assay on HeLa cells revealed that the region (-202 to -80) 
has a promoter activity. The upstream half of the promoter region (-202 to -130) 
acts as an upstream promoter element in an orientation-independent manner. 
Upstream of the promoter region are tandemly reiterated multiple regulatory 
regions (-2.5k to -690, -690 to -460, -460 to -260, and -260 to -202), each of 
which negatively regulates the CANP mL gene promoter as well as heterologous 
promoters in an orientation-independent manner. The presence of a cellular 
factor(s) mediating the action of these positive (promoter) and negative 
regulatory elements was suggested by an in vivo competition assay. The negative 
regulation of transcription mediated by these reiterated cis-acting elements and 
trans-acting factor(s) may play an essential role in the expression of the CANP 
mL gene."
2540000,"Protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 was purified from bovine adipose tissue. The 
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa by SDS/PAGE and a Stokes' 
radius of 3.4 nm. It was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on a 
threonyl residue; this phosphorylation was necessary for inhibition of protein 
phosphatase-1. Bovine adipose tissue inhibitor-1 was compared directly with 
rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-1 and with a 32000-Mr, dopamine- and 
cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein from bovine brain (DARPP-32), also an inhibitor of 
protein phosphatase-1. By the following biochemical and immunochemical criteria, 
bovine adipose tissue inhibitor-1 was found to be very similar and possibly 
identical to DARPP-32 and was clearly distinct from skeletal muscle inhibitor-1: 
molecular mass by SDS/PAGE; Stokes' radii; phosphorylation on threonine 
residues; Staphylococcus-aureus-V8-protease-generated peptide patterns analyzed 
by SDS/PAGE; tryptic phosphopeptide maps analysed by two-dimensional thin-layer 
electrophoresis/chromatography; elution on reverse-phase HPLC; chymotryptic 
peptide maps as analysed by reverse-phase HPLC; amino acid composition; antibody 
recognition by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting; effect of cyanogen 
bromide cleavage on protein phosphatase inhibitor activity. Based on these 
results we conclude that bovine brain and adipose tissue contain an identical 
phosphoprotein inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (DARPP-32), which is distinct 
from that of skeletal muscle (inhibitor-1)."
2540108,"We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple 
adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme. Detailed 
histopathological study of all 25 polyps removed from his colon confirmed the 
distinct morphological and numerical features of the colonic polyposis in 
Turcot's syndrome. Moreover, 45% of the total polyps and all polyps with a 
diameter exceeding 2 cm showed malignant transformation, indicating the 
precancerous nature of these polyps. These findings are discussed together with 
data obtained from a literature review of 32 histopathologically confirmed cases 
of Turcot's syndrome with reference to the possible heterogeneous nature of the 
syndrome at the present time. The current views on the relationship of Turcot's 
syndrome to other polyposis coli syndromes are presented."
2541880,"Halobacterium halobium contains two gas vacuole protein genes that are located 
in plasmid pHH1 (p-vac) and in the chromosomal DNA (c-vac). The mutation 
frequency for these genes is different: the constitutively expressed p-vac gene 
is mutated with a frequency of 10(-2), while the chromosomal gene expressed in 
the stationary phase of growth is mutated with a frequency of 10(-5). The 
difference in the mutation susceptibility is due to the dynamics of plasmid 
pHH1. p-vac gene mutations are caused (i) by the integration of an insertion 
element or (ii) by a deletion event encompassing the p-vac gene region. In 
contrast, c-vac mutants analyzed to date incurred neither insertion elements nor 
deletions. Deletion events within pHH1 occur at high frequencies during the 
development of a H. halobium culture. The investigation of the fusion regions 
resulting from deletion events indicates that insertion elements are involved. 
The analysis of pHH1 deletion variants led to a 4 kilobase pair DNA region 
containing the origin of replication of the pHH1 plasmid."
2544595,"Phospholamban is the major membrane protein of the heart phosphorylated in 
response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. In cell-free systems, cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase catalyzes exclusive phosphorylation of serine 16 of 
phospholamban, whereas Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gives exclusive 
phosphorylation of threonine 17 (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, 
J. L., Wegener, A. D., and Jones, L. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333-13341). 
In this work we have localized the sites of phospholamban phosphorylation in 
intact ventricles treated with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. 
Isolation of phosphorylated phospholamban from 32P-perfused guinea pig 
ventricles, followed by partial acid hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis, 
revealed phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues. At steady state 
after isoproterenol exposure, phospholamban contained approximately equimolar 
amounts of these two phosphoamino acids. Two major tryptic phosphopeptides 
containing greater than 90% of the incorporated radioactivity were obtained from 
phospholamban labeled in intact ventricles. The amino acid sequences of these 
two tryptic peptides corresponded exactly to residues 14-25 and 15-25 of canine 
cardiac phospholamban, thus localizing the sites of in situ phosphorylation to 
serine 16 and threonine 17. Phosphorylation of phospholamban at two sites in 
heart perfused with isoproterenol was supported by detection of 11 distinct 
mobility forms of the pentameric protein by use of the Western blotting method, 
consistent with each phospholamban monomer containing two phosphorylation sites, 
and with each pentamer containing from 0 to 10 incorporated phosphates. Our 
results localize the sites of in situ phospholamban phosphorylation to serine 16 
and threonine 17 and, furthermore, are consistent with the phosphorylations of 
these 2 residues being catalyzed by cAMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinases, respectively."
2549305,"Lung cancer tissues from 68 patients were examined for epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) receptor levels and EGF receptor gene copy numbers. Histologic cell types 
of these lung cancer tissues included squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 30), 
adenocarcinoma (n = 28), large-cell carcinoma (n = 4), and small-cell carcinoma 
(n = 6). Tissues of squamous-cell carcinoma exhibited exceptionally high 
125I-EGF binding activity, and those of small-cell carcinoma showed no EGF 
binding activity. Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed EGF receptor 
gene amplification in the squamous-cell carcinomas with high EGF binding 
activity. The EGF receptor levels in squamous-cell carcinomas and 
adenocarcinomas were compared with their pathological staging grouping and 
pathological findings, including degree of differentiation, diameter of tumor, 
and lymph node metastasis. However, unlike previous reports on breast and 
bladder cancers, there was no obvious correlation between these pathological 
characteristics and the EGF receptor levels of lung cancer."
2562822,"To better map the location of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) 
gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7AE-11. This 
microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment 
and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17. We 
have identified 269 cosmid clones with human sequences from a 7AE-11 library 
and, using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with a total of six chromosome 17q 
breakpoints, have mapped 240 of these clones on chromosome 17q. The panel 
included a hybrid (NF13) carrying a der(22) chromosome that was isolated from an 
NF1 patient with a balanced translocation, t(17;22) (q11.2;q11.2). Fifty-three 
of the cosmids map into a region spanning the NF13 breakpoint, as defined by the 
two closest flanking breakpoints (17q11.2 and 17q11.2-q12). RFLP clones from a 
subset of these cosmids have been mapped by linkage analysis in normal reference 
families, to localize the NF1 gene more precisely and to enhance the potential 
for genetic diagnosis of this disorder. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an 
important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme 
digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA 
and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint."
2563937,"Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the 
extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the 
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Clinical studies have been 
divided on the efficacy of protirelin (TRH) despite strong experimental findings 
that are consistent with a role for the peptide in ALS. Recent findings provide 
evidence of a gender-related specificity in the ability of protirelin to 
potentiate the monosynaptic reflex. While castration in male neonatal rats 
lowered the sensitivity to protirelin, testosterone treatment restored that 
sensitivity. An examination of the clinical studies reveals a failure either to 
identify patients' sex or to separate the results on the basis of sex. These 
findings provide convincing evidence for the potential efficacy of protirelin in 
ALS if the patient's sex and underlying hormonal status are taken into account."
2564419,"Using an interspecific cross, gene linkage relationships among members of the 
murine complement receptor-related genes, C4bp, Cfh, Mcry, and Mcr2, were 
analyzed by segregation of RFLP in 200 mice. The human homologues of these genes 
are tightly linked, composing the RCA locus, which maps to human chromosome 
(Chr.)1q32, within a large linkage group conserved between human Chr.1q21-32 and 
mouse Chr.1. RFLP associated with C4bp and Cfh map within this conserved linkage 
group; Cfh is located 9 cM telomeric to C4bp, which is consistent with linkage 
data for their human homologues. Mcry and Mcr2, while tightly linked, are 
located outside the conserved group, 40 cM telomeric to C4bp. These data suggest 
that a translocation or inversion occurred within the RCA family during the 
evolution of the mouse, defining a breakpoint of this large conserved linkage 
group."
2564739,"Many Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) patients have a 
cytogenetic deletion of 15q11q13. While AS and PWS share a similar cytogenetic 
anomaly, they have very different clinical phenotypes. DNAs from 4 AS patients 
were examined using 5 chromosome 15q11q13-specific cloned DNA segments. With the 
present level of resolution, the molecular deletions between AS and those 
previously reported for PWS did not appear to differ. However, in contrast to 
the paternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 observed in the majority 
of PWS patients, maternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 was 
demonstrated in the AS patients by restriction fragment length polymorphisms 
(RFLPs)."
2570015,"The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Finland is one tenth that in other 
Caucasian populations. To study the genetics of CF in Finland, we used a 
combined molecular and genealogical approach. Out of the 20 Finnish families 
with a living CF patient, 19 were typed for eight closely linked restriction 
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) at the MET, D7S8, and D7S23 loci. The 
birthplaces of the parents and grandparents were traced using population 
registries. Allele and haplotype frequencies in Finland are similar to those of 
other European and North American populations, but are modified by sampling: two 
regional CF gene clusters, evidently the results of a founder effect, were 
identified. Generally, the gene was evenly distributed over the population, 
carrier frequency being estimated at approximately 1.3%. We conclude that CF in 
Finland is caused by the common Caucasian mutation(s), and that the low 
frequency of the gene can be explained by a negative sampling effect and genetic 
drift."
2573519,"Individual T cell populations are characterized by specific surface proteins, 
namely by the T cell receptor complex (TCR) and by two accessory molecules, CD8 
(Lyt2) and CD4 (L3T4). CD8 and CD4 are required for T cell interactions with 
class I or class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. In the thymus, 
immature CD8(-4)-TCR- cells differentiate, possibly via a short stage of CD8+4- 
thymocytes, into CD8+4+ TCR+ T cells and mature further into the main T cell 
populations, the CD8+4- TCR+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the CD4+8- TCR+ T 
helper cells. In order to analyse the differentiation steps involving CD8, we 
generated transgenic mice expressing mu heavy chain genes from an anti-Lyt2.2 
hybridoma. Transgenic lines expressing either the complete (mu sm) or only the 
secreted mu protein (mu s) suffer from a severe depletion of their CD8+4+ 
thymocytes affecting also the mature CD8+4- and CD4+8- populations. The 
depletion is correlated to the expression of transgenic mu-chain proteins within 
thymocytes. This intrathymocyte expression of the mu chain prevents CD8-4- 
thymocytes from further differentiation, most probably via intracellular 
interactions between mu heavy chain and CD8 proteins. These results show that 
CD8 plays an important role during thymocyte maturation."
2575692,"For the first time a causal treatment of hepatic encephalopathy may be possible 
by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. In contrast to all other treatments 
used so far by flumazenil hepatic encephalopathy improves within minutes. 
Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans 
and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. For 
treatment of hepatic encephalopathy development of a new antagonist with a 
longer half-life is desirable. However, ut should be stressed that the current 
experience with flumazenil is limited and that the effects of flumazenil on 
hepatic encephalopathy is not proven by randomized controlled studies. 
Therefore, this drug should only be used in clinical studies."
2579060,"The gene coding for the metabolically stable 6S RNA of Escherichia coli has been 
cloned, sequenced, and partially characterized in expression analyses. The DNA 
sequence results confirm the accuracy of the previously established RNA sequence 
and, with genomic hybridization data, reveal that there is only one copy of the 
6S DNA in the chromosome. Consistent with its relaxed mode of expression, the 
promoter region of the 6S RNA gene was found to lack the hypothetical GC-rich 
discriminator domain common to other stable RNA genes under stringent control. 
The sequence results also revealed the occurrence of a 540-base-pair open 
reading frame immediately downstream from the 6S RNA coding region. Results from 
the expression analyses show that the protein and RNA coding regions are 
cotranscribed in vitro and that the open reading frame is translated in vivo."
2579655,"A 104 nucleotide-long small RNA, referred to as s-poly A+ RNA, containing 30 
adenosine residues on its 3' -end was found in dinoflagellates, purified and its 
nucleotide sequence was determined. The sequence is: (sequence text) The 
polyadenylation signal AAUAAA was not found in this RNA; this result indicates 
that the 30 nucleotide-long poly A on the 3' -end is either coded for by this 
gene, or the poly A chain is added on this small RNA by a mechanism different 
from that for polyadenylation of messenger RNAs. Two polyadenylated small RNAs 
identified previously were implicated in differentiation of chicken heart muscle 
cells (Deshpande, A. K., Jakowlew, S. B., Arnold, H., Crawford, P. A. and 
Siddiqui, M. A. Q. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6521-6527), and in brain specific 
mRNA transcription (Sutcliffe, J. G., Milner, R. J., Gottesfeld, J. M. and 
Lerner, R. A. (1984) Nature 309, 237-241). This RNA is the first polyadenylated 
small RNA to be sequenced."
2627465,"A significant reduction in plasma free triiodothyronine (T3) (P less than 
0.0001) has been observed in patients undergoing open heart surgery. The 
beneficial effect of T3 would appear to be associated with increased synthesis 
and utilization of myocardial high energy stores. We have therefore administered 
T3 (4-10 micrograms iv) to 10 patients either when difficulty was being 
experienced in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support (n = 5), or 
when myocardial function remained extremely poor (n = 5), despite inotropic and 
intraaortic balloon pump support. Mean preoperative NYHA functional class of the 
10 patients was 3.2, left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP) 20 mm Hg and 
ejection fraction (EF) 40%. The mean myocardial ischaemia time was 72 min (range 
40-120 min). Within 1 h of T3 administration the mean plasma free T3 level had 
risen from 1.03 to 3.56 micrograms/ml and CPB was discontinued in all 5 cases. 
Balloon pump support (n = 2) was no longer essential within 3 h. At 1 h, the 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) had risen from 42 to 78 mm Hg, and heart rate (HR) 
from 90 to 104 beats/min; the left atrial pressure (LAP) had fallen from 30 to 
14 mm Hg, and the central venous pressure (CVP) from 20 to 11 cm H2O. (All 
changes significant at P less than 0.0001.) Inotropic support had been 
significantly reduced or discontinued. To our knowledge, T3 has not been 
administered previously as an inotropic agent to patients who have undergone 
cardiac surgery. We believe that T3 may have an important role in the rescue of 
failing hearts following a period of myocardial ischaemia in patients who have 
undergone open heart surgery."

teeth anomaly, split hand complex and retinal changes with prominent 
pigmentations located in the posterior pole of the retina. Retinal degeneration 
had shown minimal progression during 11 years. A longer follow-up period was 
necessary to make a definite diagnosis of these fundus changes. This is an 
isolated case born from a consanguineous marriage."

2630235,"Multidose pharmacokinetics of vancomycin were studied in 15 infants with 
gestational age less than 36 weeks and suspected or confirmed Staphylococcus 
epidermidis infections. Postconceptional age (PCA) at the time of the study 
ranged from 26 to 44 weeks. Vancomycin individual doses ranged from 6.7 to 10.6 
mg/kg and were infused over 60 min. Five postinfusion samples were obtained in 
13 infants, while 4 samples were obtained in 2 patients. Vancomycin 
pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a 
two-compartment model using a weighted least-squares nonlinear regression 
method. Mean vancomycin body clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vdss) and 
terminal elimination half-life were 1.37 ml/min, 0.58 liters and 5.6 h, 
respectively. When standardized for patient weight, the CL and Vdss values were 
1.07 ml/min/kg and 0.48 liters/kg, respectively. The CL (ml/min/kg) was strongly 
inversely correlated with the serum creatinine (r = -0.82), while a weaker but 
significant association was noted with PCA (r = 0.41). These data suggest that 
in sick infants, in addition to the PCA, serum creatinine should be considered 
when determining the initial vancomycin dosing regimen."
2641165,"The results are presented of serological tests by the neutralization method for 
antigens of Coxsackie B group, and by the haemagglutination inhibition method 
for three types of parainfluenza and sporadic influenza virus in 529 patients 
with myocarditis. In 7 cases the virus was isolated from stools. Virus aetiology 
of the disease was confirmed in 23.4% of cases, on average. Raised levels of 
antibodies to Coxsackie B antigens were found more frequently than the levels of 
antibodies to parainfluenza viruses. Seroconversion was more frequent in 
infections by parainfluenza type 3 than type 2. During an influenza epidemic in 
5 cases raised levels of antibodies to the epidemic-causing strain were 
observed."
2644653,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins of replication (autonomously 
replicating sequences; ARSs), centromeres, and telomeres have been isolated and 
characterized. The identification of these structures allows the construction of 
artificial chromosomes in which the architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes may 
be studied. A common feature of most, and possibly all, natural yeast 
chromosomes is that they have an ARS within 2 kilobases of their physical ends. 
To study the effects of such telomeric ARSs on chromosome maintenance, we 
introduced artificial chromosomes of approximately 15 and 60 kilobases into 
yeast cells and analyzed the requirements for telomeric ARSs and the effects of 
ARS-free chromosomal arms on the stability of these molecules. We find that 
terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as 
telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' 
sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis 
than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that 
yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement 
for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis. The results 
also show that there is no requirement for an origin of replication on each arm 
of the artificial chromosomes, indicating that a replication fork may 
efficiently move through a functional centromere region."
2645074,"Grisel's syndrome is a unilateral or bilateral subluxation of C1 on C2, 
associated with an infectious condition in the head or neck. Anatomic studies 
have demonstrated the existence of a periodontoidal vascular plexus that drains 
the posterior superior pharyngeal region. No lymph nodes are present in this 
plexus, so septic exudates may be freely transferred from the pharynx to the 
C1-C2 articulation. The resulting synovial and vascular engorgements may cause 
mechanical and chemical damage to the transverse and facet capsular ligaments 
leading to subluxation. The primary treatment of Grisel's syndrome is medical: 
the underlying infectious organism must be isolated and appropriate antibiotics 
prescribed. The subluxation is reduced in halter or skeletal traction. The 
authors use the classification scheme of rotary subluxation proposed by 
Fielding, so that treatment appropriate to the specific type of subluxation is 
used. Based on biomechanical data predicting articular instability and canal 
compromise proportional to the extent of ligamentous injury, the following 
specific forms of immobilization are recommended to ensure ligamentous healing: 
Fielding Type I (transverse ligament intact and bilateral facet capsular injury) 
soft collar; Type II (transverse ligament and unilateral facet capsular injury) 
Philadelphia collar or SOMI brace; and Type III (transverse ligament and 
bilateral facet capsular ligament injury) halo. Following six to eight weeks of 
immobilization, stability is assessed by the study of flexion-extension 
roentgenograms. Should residual instability be demonstrated, arthrodesis is 
indicated."
2647685,"Once formerly thought to be a rare disorder, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
(TTP) is becoming increasingly recognized. It is characterized by a pentad of 
clinical findings, including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic 
purpura, neurologic and renal abnormalities, and fever. Following a case report, 
the major clinical findings, pathophysiologic findings, diagnoses, and use of 
various therapeutic modalities are discussed."
2649173,"We studied the relationship of direct karyotypes, determined at diagnosis and 
remission, to Abelson-related tyrosine kinase activity and the cytogenetic 
features of erythroid and myeloid colonies derived from remission marrow of six 
children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These patients had either the 
characteristic Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] or 
cytogenetically similar variants with a 22q11 breakpoint but no detectable 
cytogenetic involvement of 9q34. The findings suggested two distinct subtypes of 
ALL: one defined by t(9;22)(q34;q11) and expression of P185BCR-ABL tyrosine 
kinase and one with variant karyotypes and no P185BCR-ABL expression. The former 
comprises cases with Ph1 + marrow cells and Ph1 + erythroid and (or) myeloid 
colonies in remission marrow and others in which the t(9;22) is undetectable in 
remission marrow cells. In the latter subgroup, the disease may reflect more 
extreme mosaicism with a similar stem cell that is cytogenetically undetectable. 
Variant karyotypes included a del(22)(q11) in one patient and a t(6;22;15;9) 
(q21;q11;q?22;q21) in another; in both instances, the malignant blast cells 
lacked P185BCR-ABL expression. Thus ALL with t(9;22)(q34;q11) should be 
distinguished from ALL with other involvement of the 22q11 breakpoint by 
molecular studies including protein expression. The diversity of karyotypic 
findings in cases with involvement of 22q11 suggests at least two mechanisms of 
leukemogenesis in patients with ALL defined by this breakpoint."
2649965,"The combination of acute pharyngotonsillitis, neck pain, fever, and pulmonary 
septic emboli caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum in a healthy young person is 
extremely rare. The entity was described by Lemierre in 1936 as a typical 
syndrome easy to recognize and diagnose exclusively on clinical grounds. A case 
of Lemierre's disease is reported, and 10 other cases found in the medical 
literature are reviewed."
2653554,"A double-blind study of terodiline compared with placebo was performed in 58 
children aged 6 to 14 years with urgency or urge incontinence. All had an 
unstable bladder at cystometry. A bladder regimen was emphasised during the 
study. Continence was improved according to micturition charting and a pad test 
in both groups. Terodiline at 25 mg/day, however, gave significantly better 
results than placebo. In patients with a subnormal bladder capacity (less than 
or equal to 150 ml), a significant increase in capacity was recorded on 
cystometry during medication with terodiline but not with placebo. The improved 
continence seen in the placebo group was probably due to the non-specific 
bladder training achieved by the child's increased awareness and adult 
involvement during treatment. The even better results attained in the terodiline 
group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children 
with urge incontinence, particularly since no important adverse effects were 
noted during an 8-week period."
2654251,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome in which the airflow created from 
breathing ceases through the upper airway although diaphragm movement continues. 
Resulting complications include severe daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, 
loud snoring, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Patients affected with OSA are 
frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. The 
diagnosis of OSA requires an all-night polysomnographic recording; neither 
snoring nor other subjective complaints constitute adequate criteria for 
treatment. The treatment objective for OSA is to maintain airway patency. A 
potential treatment discussed here is temporary advancement of the mandible or 
tongue during sleep with the use of dental appliances."
2658738,"The present study explores the origin of human Robertsonian translocations (RT) 
and the causes of the nonrandom participation of the different acrocentrics in 
them. Satellite associations have been analysed in 966 cells from 8 persons, and 
1266 RT with ascertainment have been collected from the literature. The 
observation that the chromosomes preferentially taking part in satellite 
associations vary between individuals is confirmed. However, since a preferred 
chromosome appears to associate at random with the others, this phenomenon 
should not add to the nonrandomness of the RT. Most RT presumably arise through 
adjacent chromatid exchanges corresponding to mitotic chiasmata, in the 
pericentric regions of the acrocentrics. Our working hypothesis is that there is 
a basic exchange rate between any two acrocentrics. The surplus of t(14q21q) is 
presumed to depend on these two chromosomes having a homologous pericentric 
region. The 10-20 times higher incidence of t(13q14q) as compared with other RT 
is best explained by crossing-over between homologous, but relatively inverted, 
segments in these chromosomes. Of the 246 RT ascertained through repeated 
abortions or infertility, 56 were found through the latter. Of these, chromosome 
14 was involved in 51. The infertility may be caused by a small deletion of 14q, 
as is often the case in 15q in Prader-Willi syndrome. In all RT ascertained 
through 21 or 13 trisomy, respectively, the relevant chromosome is one of the 
participants. Our data thus do not give any support to the idea of

2659540,"We investigated the marker profile of human ascitic and cultured mesothelial 
cells, and compared it to that of ovarian carcinoma cells which are related in 
terms of their histogenesis, unrelated colon carcinomas being used as reference. 
Mesothelial and ovarian carcinoma cells could not be distinguished by 
(intermediate) filament typing, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to keratins, 
vimentins and desmins. Colon carcinomas differed from mesothelial cells and 
ovarian carcinomas by the absence of keratin-7 filaments. The epithelial marker 
BW 495/36 was completely negative on mesothelial cells and positive on all 
ovarian and colon carcinoma cells. While CEA was found on about 85% of all colon 
carcinomas, CEA expression on mesothelial cells and ovarian carcinoma cells was 
below 20%. The ovarian carcinoma markers (OV-TL 3, OV-TL 10, OC 125, MOV 18) 
were strongly positive on ovarian carcinomas and negative on colon carcinomas 
(or limited to traces of immunofluorescence on some samples). Although the 
mesothelial cells showed weak or negative reactivity with these markers, OC 125 
antigen was found by immunoelectron microscopy on the surface of cultured 
mesothelial cells, and was shed in the culture supernatant at concentrations of 
50, 28, and 25 CA 125 U/ml/10(4) positive cells. This suggests that mesothelial 
cells may be responsible for the synthesis of CA 125 in ascitic fluid. The data 
indicate that ovarian carcinomas, mesothelial cells and colon carcinomas can be 
distinguished using a combination of anti-keratin antibodies with BW 495/36 and 
anti-ovarian carcinoma markers."
2660231,"Paget's disease of bone is characterized by the progressive and extensive 
replacement, in one or several bones, of normal bone tissue by a bone tissue of 
rough and irregular structure, the excessive and disorderly renewal of which 
gradually produces hyperdensity and hypertrophy of the bones involved. The 
condition results from the action of abnormal and overactive osteoclasts 
containing virus-like intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The disease 
profoundly alters the physiology of bones in the region affected. The 
viral-looking inclusions that enter the osteoclasts seem to induce a loss of 
control of bone renewal and remodelling, as shown by histology and radiology. 
The resorption-formation mechanism persists but it is unbalanced, facilitating 
bone resorption during two to five years, then bone formation. In that way, 
subjects with Paget's disease, who have reached the age of physiological 
osteopenia, show an often important increase in bone density and mass. Paget's 
disease of bone is a disease grafted on the skeleton: it is partly dependent on 
the skeletal status of the host. The activity of Paget's disease is evaluated by 
measuring the ratio of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels to the volumes of 
normal and pagetic bones; the author suggests a mathematical formula for 
calculating this ratio."
2665605,"Ultraviolet light induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are recognized and repaired 
by a number of unique cellular surveillance systems. At the highest level of 
complexity Escherichia coli (E. coli) has a uvr DNA repair system comprising the 
UvrA, UvrB and UvrC proteins responsible for incision. There are several 
preincision steps governed by this pathway which includes an ATP-dependent UvrA 
dimerization reaction required for UvrAB nucleoprotein formation. This complex 
formation driven by ATP binding, is associated with localized topological 
unwinding of DNA. This protein complex can catalyze an ATP-dependent 5'----3' 
directed strand displacement of D-loop DNA or short single strands annealed to a 
single stranded circular or linear DNA. This putative translocational process is 
arrested when damaged sites are encountered. The complex is now primed for dual 
incision catalyzed by UvrC. The remainder of the repair process involves UvrD 
(helicase II) and DNA polymerase I for a coordinately controlled ""excision 
resynthesis"" step accompanied by UvrABC turnover. Furthermore, it is proposed 
that levels of repair proteins can be regulated by proteolysis. UvrB is 
converted to truncated UvrB* by a stress induced protease which also acts at 
similar sites on the E. coli Ada protein. Although UvrB* can bind with UvrA to 
DNA it cannot participate in helicase or incision reactions. It is also a 
DNA-dependent ATPase."
2666281,"Ever since its description approximately 100 years ago, the sphincter of Oddi 
has been surrounded by controversy. First, whether it indeed existed, second, 
whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether 
abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal 
and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the 
physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are 
determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies 
support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the 
control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally 
importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and 
pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter 
of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. 
Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal 
function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as 
a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human 
sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of 
possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to 
define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms 
consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the manometry, 
we have subdivided the dysfunction into two groups; a group characterised by a 
stenotic pattern - that is, raised sphincter basal pressure - and a second group 
having a dyskinetic pattern - that is, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin 
injection, rapid contraction frequency, high percentage of retrograde 
contractions, or short periods of raised basal percentage of retrograde 
contractions, or short periods of raised basal pressure. It is apparent from the 
mamometry but also from the clinical data that the patients are a heterogeneous 
group and thus any therapy would need to be tailored for each patient and 
abnormality. The most recent therapeutic data suggest that patients with the 
stenotic pattern on manometry respond to division of the sphincter, however, 
those patients with the dyskinetic manometric pattern show no significant effect 
after sphincterotomy. Further prospective trials evaluating therapeutic options 
are under way and their results are eagerly awaited."
2667789,"Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and 
cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's 
sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, 
cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984, 
these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial 
chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; 
actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1) 
alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days 
21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3) 
local radiotherapy (RT); and (4) maintenance chemotherapy with alternating IVA 
and VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) for up to 9 months. In May 1987, 87 patients 
with previously untreated ES entered the study; 61 had localized ES. To date, 54 
patients with localized disease and 22 with metastatic disease have finished 
initial chemotherapy; 40 patients with localized disease have been evaluated. In 
all, 28 patients (70%) were in complete remission (17 patients) or had a tumor 
regression of greater than 50% 11 patients) and were considered to be good 
responders; 12 patients were considered to be poor responders. After local 
radiotherapy in all but 7 patients and surgical resection in 29, 52 of 54 were 
considered to be in clinical remission. A total of 13 patients with metastatic 
disease were good responders at the completion of the initial chemotherapy. 
These results confirm the efficacy of primary chemotherapy using ifosfamide for 
the treatment of ES."
2669121,"Hyperoxaluria and hypercalciuria are common features of renal calcium stone 
disease. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the 
relationships between the intestinal absorption and the renal handling of 
oxalate and calcium in patients with idiopathic renal stone disease and in 
patients with enteric hyperoxaluria following jejunoileal bypass (JIB), in 
comparison with healthy controls. Hyperoxaluria was associated with a higher 
frequency of both stone episodes and stone operations than a lower urinary 
oxalate concentration. Patients with idiopathic stone disease showed increased 
intestinal uptake of both oxalate and calcium, which was probably of importance 
for their propensity to form calcium oxalate-containing stones. Hyperoxaluria in 
patients with JIB was found to be a result of hyperabsorption of oxalate, and 
these patients displayed altered oxalate kinetics with continued urinary 
excretion of orally administered 14C-oxalate for more than 48 hours. The 
prolonged excretion is assumed to be due to a prolonged absorption and/or an 
increased oxalate pool. Malabsorption of calcium and low fasting urinary calcium 
excretion in the JIB patients were associated with high tubular reabsorption of 
calcium, the latter presumably attributable to a compensatory increase in 
circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most recurrent renal stone formers the 
urinary calcium concentration was increased, with an inverse relationship to 
serum PTH, indicating intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium. A subgroup of 
hypercalciuric patients showed increased urinary calcium due to reduced tubular 
reabsorption of calcium. It is suggested that this is a renal defect resulting 
in a compensatory rise in PTH. Two different mechanisms of similar prevalence 
might explain enhanced secretion of PTH in normocalcaemic stone disease, namely 
reduced calcium absorption and a renal defect in the form of reduced tubular 
reabsorption of calcium. Glycosaminoglycans efficiently inhibit calcium oxalate 
crystal growth by binding to the surface of calcium oxalate crystals. In this 
study the binding was dependent on ionic strength. Higher affinity to the 
crystals may be the reason why highly charged glycosaminoglycans were more 
efficient inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystal growth. A calcium-containing 
organic marine hydrocolloid with the capacity to bind oxalate in vitro was shown 
to reduce enteric hyperoxaluria. In addition to biochemical effects considerable 
improvements in diarrhoeal symptoms were reported."

Leishmania. It occurs in endemic foci scattered throughout Asia, Africa, the 
Americas, and the Mediterranean countries. The disease is complex and may

leishmaniasis is relatively easy to diagnose. Undiagnosed, it causes 
considerable morbidity and mortality. Treatment is often difficult, and current 
therapies leave much to be desired."
2671060,"Molindone hydrochloride, a dihydroindolone neuroleptic, is structurally distinct 
from other classes of neuroleptics. Molindone exhibits many similarities to 
other neuroleptics, including dopamine receptor blockade, antipsychotic 
efficacy, and extrapyramidal side effects. Despite these similarities, molindone 
also has atypical properties and inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase in vitro 
and in vivo. Several studies have shown that molindone causes less dopamine 
receptor supersensitivity than other neuroleptics and thus may be less likely to 
cause tardive dyskinesia. It also appears to have a greater effect on mesolimbic 
and mesocortical dopamine neurons than on those in the nigrostriatal dopamine 
system. Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have 
less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents. The 
authors review the laboratory and clinical data on molindone and discuss the 
relevance of atypical research findings to the clinical characteristics of this 
antipsychotic agent."
2671903,"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism 
associated with a virtually complete deficiency of the enzyme 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT). The disease is 
characterized by hyperuricemia, self-multilation, choreoathetosis, spasticity, 
and mental retardation. The abnormalities of purine metabolism are present at 
birth and may lead to uric acid crystalluria and stone formation early in life. 
Radiographic findings described in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome include faintly 
radio-opaque stones on abdominal radiographs or, if renal disease is present, 
small kidneys with poor function on intravenous urogram. Radiolucent stones are 
usually composed of uric acid; however, several cases of xanthine and 
hypoxanthine-containing calculi in Lesch-Nyhan patients receiving allopurinl 
therapy have also been described. Oxypurine is the collective name for the 
compounds hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid, and all may be radiolucent. We 
report a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with presumed renal parenchymal oxypurine 
deposition demonstrated readily by ultrasonography but not detected on standard 
radiographs or intravenous urograms."
2672273,"Research during the last 15 years has conclusively shown that viroids are not

are most likely not directly related to viruses in an evolutionary sense. Today, 
viroids are among the most thoroughly studied biological macromolecules. Their 
molecular structures have been elucidated to a large extent, but much needs to

2674762,"According to the past reports, neuropsychiatric manifestations have been seen in 
10-75% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and are second only to 
renal involvement as a cause of death. The clinical feature is multiple. And 
cerebrovascular diseases due to systemic lupus erythematosus are detected in 
3-16% of the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Occlusion of the intracranial 
major arteries is less frequently found in other cerebrovascular diseases. And 
central nervous system involvement usually occurs at some intermediate or 
terminal stage of systemic lupus erythematosus, so is rarely regarded as one of 
the initial symptoms. We studied the case of a patient with systemic lupus 
erythematosus with occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery indicated by 
angitis and 'string of beads' appearance of the right internal carotid artery 
indicated by fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient was a 38 year old female and 
began to feel weakness in the left hand and developed mild-left hemiparesis due 
to infarction of right temporo-parieto-occipital lesion which was revealed by CT 
scan. Carotid angiograph showed irregularity at the right middle cerebral artery 
and 'string of beads' appearance of the right internal carotid artery. Gradually 
neurological manifestations improved, but a facial 'butterfly' rash, palmar 
erythema and polyarthritis were detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2682215,"""Wearing-off"" effect, the most common form of levodopa-induced fluctuations, 
seems to be related to the short plasma half-life of the drug. More sustained 
plasma levodopa levels may be achieved with a new controlled-release formulation 
of carbidopa/levodopa, Sinemet CR4. We studied 20 patients, 12 men and 8 women, 
with Parkinson's disease complicated by ""wearing-off"" phenomenon. Mean age was 
61.1 +/- 8.1 years, duration of symptoms 8.3 +/- 2.4 years, and the Hoehn-Yahr 
stage 3.0 +/- 0.9. In a 12-week double-blind study, the average number of 
tablets administered per day decreased from 5.7 +/- 1.2 to 3.8 +/- 0.7 when 
Sinemet CR4 (50/200) was substituted for the standard Sinemet (25/100) (p less 
than 0.001). However, this was at the expense of reducing the ""on"" time (without 
dyskinesia) from 9.3 +/- 4.6 to 7.5 +/- 4.3 (p less than 0.05), although the 
total ""on"" time did not significantly change. In a long-term follow-up of 18 
patients, the ""on"" time with dyskinesia and morning dystonia significantly 
increased (p less than 0.05). There was no significant change in the total daily 
dosage of levodopa, but the daily number of doses and tablets significantly 
decreased (p less than 0.001). Despite increased dyskinesia, most patients 
preferred taking fewer tablets and have elected to continue taking Sinemet CR4 
instead of standard Sinemet. Sinemet CR4 seems to offer a new and effective 
strategy for the management of levodopa-related fluctuations."
2682738,"DNA hybridization is a ""distance method"" for phylogenetic reconstruction and, as 
such, shares a set of assumptions, advantages, and problems with other 
techniques that do not directly employ character data. The technique purports to 
measure the average percent mismatch of homologous nucleotide sequences between 
the single-copy genomes of species. This measurement, as any other, is subject 
to considerations of accuracy and precision. While replicate measurements and 
technical modifications can improve precision, the accuracy of such measurements 
is limited by the equivalence of genomes under comparison. Such routine events 
in genome evolution as gene duplication and deletion may complicate the 
interpretation of DNA hybridization distances. Beyond measurement limitations, 
the most serious potential distortions of distances are due to biased sequence 
sampling and homoplasy. These problems, however, do not necessarily preclude 
phylogenetic reconstruction, and their effects may be mitigated by numerical 
corrections. Homoplasy, in particular, is a difficulty faced by all methods of 
phylogenetic inference. If such distortions can be eliminated, mitigated by 
correction, or shown to be trivial, pairwise tree-construction strategies should 
provide reliable estimates of phylogeny."
2683920,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical and hematologic effects of recombinant 
human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on patients 
with chronic severe neutropenia.
DESIGN: Open-label, phase II study of rhGM-CSF.
SETTING: Inpatient hematology and surgery clinic at a university medical center.
PATIENTS: Four consecutive patients with chronic severe neutropenia, which in 
two cases was complicated by severe infection, in one case by perianal fistula, 
and in one case by complete rectal prolapse. Two patients had chronic idiopathic 
neutropenia; one patient had congenital neutropenia (myelokathexis); and one 
patient had autoimmune neutropenia.
INTERVENTIONS: The rhGM-CSF was given intravenously or subcutaneously at 
starting dosages of 150 to 1000 micrograms/m2 body surface area.d for 12 to 14 
consecutive days. Two patients received a second course of daily rhGM-CSF 
treatment after a nontreatment interval of 14 to 20 days.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all four patients, the absolute neutrophil 
counts increased from less than 0.25 x 10(9)/L to 3.2 to 19.2 x 10(9)/L within 2 
weeks of beginning rhGM-CSF therapy. Two patients had life-threatening 
infections that resolved during therapy. The two other patients had major 
ano-rectal surgery during rhGM-CSF treatment and had no postoperative 
infections.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic neutropenia, rhGM-CSF may increase 
neutrophil counts. This therapy may be a useful adjunct to antibiotic therapy 
for patients with infection and perioperatively for patients having anorectal 
surgery."
2685414,"Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 64 nevocellular nevi (12 compound 
nevi and 52 intradermal nevi). S-100 protein and its alpha- and beta-subunits 
were almost always demonstrated in type A, B and C cells, and the staining 
intensity tended to increase in the type C cells. Neuron-specific enolase was 
detected in each type of cell; however, the population of positive cells was 
smaller among type C cells. Beta 2-microglobulin was occasionally demonstrated, 
but only in type A cells. Vimentin was frequently revealed in every type of 
cell. Neither myelin basic protein nor glial fibrillary acidic protein was 
observed in any type of cell. In contrast, normal epidermal melanocytes were 
positive for vimentin, but negative for S-100 protein and its subunits and 
neuron-specific enolase. Schwann cells were positive for S-100 protein and its 
beta-subunit, but negative for the alpha-subunit. Thus, the nevus cells shared a 
common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from 
the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the 
latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells 
in the expression of these antigenic substances. Such differences in the 
expression of antigenic substances may be due to dysontogenic manifestations in 
nevus cells."
2687104,"While it is important to search for unifying mechanisms of aging among a variety 
of model systems, evolutionary arguments suggest that the pathophysiological 
details of senescence may be, to some extent, species specific. Moreover, in 
species that are characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity, such as our 
own, one is likely to find kindreds with both ""private"" and ""public"" markers of 
aging. Crude estimates of the number of loci with the potential to modulate 
aspects of the senescent phenotype of man suggest that thousands of genes could 
be involved. No single locus appears to modulate all features. Some affect 
predominantly a single aspect (""unimodal progeroid syndromes""); familial 
Alzheimer's disease is discussed as a prototype. Linkage studies indicate 
genetic heterogeneity for autosomal dominant forms of the disease. Some loci 
affect multiple aspects of the phenotype (""segmental progeroid disorders""); the 
prototype is Werner's syndrome, an autosomal recessive. Cells from homozygotes 
behave like mutator strains and undergo accelerated senescence in vitro. 
Elucidation of the biochemical genetic basis of such abiotrophic disorders may 
shed light on specific aging processes in man."
2687698,"On the basis of comparative studies of known antibody structures and sequences 
it has been argued that there is a small repertoire of main-chain conformations 
for at least five of the six hypervariable regions of antibodies, and that the 
particular conformation adopted is determined by a few key conserved residues. 
These hypotheses are now supported by reasonably successful predictions of the 
structures of most hypervariable regions of various antibodies, as revealed by 
comparison with their subsequently determined structures."
2689138,"Clinical experience with thrombolytics in non-coronary disorders is limited to 
the plasminogen activators streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase; therapeutic 
trials with anistreplase (APSAC) are almost, and with saruplase completely, 
limited to acute myocardial infarction. In terms of thrombus clearance, 
thrombolytic drugs are superior to heparin in patients with recent deep vein 
thrombosis in the pelvis or lower limbs. In aggregate, thrombi younger than 8 
days are lysed in approximately 60% of patients treated with streptokinase, 
urokinase or alteplase. The results of studies assessing the subsequent 
development of the postphlebitic syndrome are conflicting, but most suggest that 
thrombolytic therapy can reduce symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. 
Currently, the combination of systemic thrombolytic drugs followed by heparin is 
recommended for patients with acute major pulmonary embolism who are 
haemodynamically unstable. Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been 
shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary 
vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension. Systemic venous or 
intrapulmonary infusions of alteplase offers the same benefit in terms of 
angiographic and haemodynamic improvement. A short infusion of 100 mg alteplase 
over 2 hours seems to be superior to a 24-hour infusion of urokinase. None of 
the thrombolytic trials in pulmonary embolism have been large enough to 
demonstrate a reduction in mortality. It is now generally accepted that, unless 
contraindicated, thrombolytic therapy is the front-line treatment for patients 
with massive pulmonary embolism and major haemodynamic disturbance. The local 
treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing 
of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding 
success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively. 
The main question appears to be the identification of patients in whom local 
thrombolysis is the treatment of choice, as opposed to established therapeutic 
modalities. Thrombolytic treatment following a major ischaemic stroke is 
hazardous, although clinical improvement has been noted in a minority of 
patients with recanalised cerebral arteries. The safety and efficacy of 
thrombolytic treatment remains unproven for this indication, and its use must be 
restricted to experimental protocols. Thrombolytic treatment in retinal artery 
or vein occlusion has, in practice, been abandoned."
2691247,"A translational frameshift is necessary in the synthesis of Escherichia coli 
release factor 2 (RF-2) to bypass an in-frame termination codon within the 
coding sequence. The nucleotide sequence preceding the in-phase stop codon 
within RF-2 mRNA is complementary to the 3' anti-(Shine-Dalgarno sequence) 
region found in prokaryotic 16S rRNA and Weiss et al. (1988) have concluded that 
this pairing triggers the frameshift event. In vitro production of RNA coding 
for RF-2, suitable for translation on eukaryotic ribosomes, has enabled testing 
of whether eukaryotic ribosomes can frameshift at this sequence. The 18S rRNA of 
eukaryotic ribosomes does not contain the 3' anti-(Shine-Dalgarno sequence) 
region. The prokaryotic RF-2 gene and the gene for the other release factor, 
RF-1, which does not contain an in-frame stop codon, were subcloned into 
transcription vectors such that the RNA transcripts produced in vitro would 
resemble a typical eukaryotic mRNA. These RF-1 and RF-2 RNAs both synthesized a 
major product of Mr approximately 45,000 when translated in vitro within 
reticulocyte lysate; the size expected for full length RF-1 and RF-2 molecules. 
The RF-2 product was immunoprecipitated by RF-2-specific antibodies, including 
those to regions of the protein encoded in the mRNA downstream from the 
frameshift site. The putative premature termination product, an oligopeptide of 
25 amino acids, was not detected, but a chemically synthesized derivative was 
shown to be very unstable within the translation system. Although it was not 
possible therefore to calculate an absolute efficiency of frameshifting, the 
relative efficiency of the translation of RF-2 RNA was estimated to be 10-20% of 
that of RF-1 RNA in the reticulocyte system. This was similar to the relative 
synthesis of the two proteins in a plasmid-DNA-directed prokaryotic 
transcription/translation system. These results show that in vitro on eukaryotic 
ribosomes where the Shine-Dalgarno-type interaction is not possible, high 
efficiency frameshifting around the in-phase stop codon in the RF-2 mRNA can 
still occur."
2692969,"A double-blind study was carried out in 30 female patients with generalized 
anxiety disorders associated with depressive symptoms to compare the 
effectiveness and tolerability of etizolam and alprazolam. Patients were 
allocated at random to receive one or other drug at a dosage of 0.5 mg twice 
daily for 5 weeks. Assessments were made on entry and after 3 and 5 weeks of 
treatment using the Hamilton rating scales for anxiety and for depression. The 
results showed that both drugs had marked anxiolytic and antidepressive 
activity, there being significant reductions after treatment in mean total 
rating scores compared to baseline. Although there was no statistically 
significant difference between the two drugs, there was a trend for etizolam to 
be more effective in relieving anxiety somatization symptoms. Apart from 
moderate daytime drowsiness in a few patients, both drugs were considered to be 
extremely well tolerated."
2695099,"Interest in DNA-intercalating ligands as anti-cancer drugs has developed greatly 
since the clinical success of doxorubicin. However, despite a great deal of 
'rational design' of synthetic DNA-intercalators, only a few such compounds have 
proved clinically useful. This review briefly surveys the history of 
DNA-intercalators as clinically-used anti-cancer drugs, summarizes the known 
structure-experimental activity relationships and modes of action, and concludes 
that a factor in the slow progress is that much of the work on these compounds 
has been carried out by chemists, who were generally more interested in 
ligand/DNA interactions than drug development. Future development of the class 
rests on a careful consideration of the biochemical reasons behind the common 
limitations of the present drugs. The most important are: the inherent 
resistance of non-cycling cells, the rapid development (even by cycling cells) 
of resistance by the expression of both P-glycoprotein and altered topoisomerase 
II, limitations on drug distribution to and transport into tumours, low 
extravascular pH in tumours and the cardiotoxic side-effects of quinonoid 
chromophores. These considerations provide a set of constraints on 
physicochemical properties which must be considered in future design. However, 
within these constraints, there are useful future avenues for the development of 
DNA-intercalators as anti-cancer drugs. These include: (i) the production of 
improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as 
drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated 
chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators 
of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other 
reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to 
DNA."
2696283,"A prospective trial for diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (NPH) was carried out in 30 consecutive patients (12 women, 18 
men, mean age: 61 years, range 21-80). The clinical diagnosis was based on the 
presence of one or more of the three clinical elements of NPH: gait disturbance, 
incontinence and mental deterioration as well as radiological criteria of 
ventricular enlargement. Preoperatively, physical and radiological 
investigations and psychological tests were routinely performed. Cognitive 
functions such as fluency, selective attention and motor speed were re-examined 
within 24 hours after spinal tap of 40-50 cc. of CSF. Results of shunting were 
confirmed by CT scans and evaluated by means of psychological tests at least 3 
months postoperatively. Psychological tests included IQ tests and tests for 
memory, selective attention and motor speed. Results indicate that spinal tap 
had no predictive value for the results after shunting as far as psychological 
functions are concerned. Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions 
of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of 
memory. Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed 
significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, 
motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur."

adhesive capsulitis responded more favorably to the treatment than those with a 
traumatic etiology. The duration of symptoms had no correlation with the results 
of therapy. There were no complications from the treatment."
2702688,"In Drosophila embryogenesis, mitotic control undergoes a significant transition 
during the 14th interphase. Mitoses before interphase 14 run on maternal 
products, and occur in metasynchronous waves. Mitoses after interphase 14 
require zygotic transcription, and occur asyncronously in an intricate, highly 
ordered spatio-temporal pattern. Mutations at the string (stg) locus cause 
cell-cycle arrest during this transition, in G2 of interphase 14, yet do not 
arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is 
required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg, 
and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25, 
a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that 
zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns 
which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions. 
Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing 
and location of these embryonic cell divisions."
2703281,"The influence of 10 min warming-up at 40% VO2 max on thermal, circulatory, and 
metabolic responses to an incremental exercise to exhaustion as well as on the 
anaerobic threshold at the blood lactate level of 4 mmol.l-1 (AT) and the 
individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was investigated in eight cross-country 
skiers. During exercise preceded by warming-up, the mean skin temperature (T sk) 
and external auditory canal temperature (Tac) did not change significantly in 
contrast to exercise without warming-up, producing a rise in both T sk and Tac 
(by approx. 1.2 degrees C and 1.1 degrees C, respectively). Warming-up did not 
alter the course of the rectal temperature changes during exercise. With 
warming-up skin humidity rose immediately after the beginning of exercise, 
whereas the onset of sweating without warming-up appeared much later at higher 
work intensities. Warming-up did not change the circulatory and ventilatory 
responses to incremental exercise and the oxygen uptake (VO2) either at 
submaximal or maximal work loads. With warming-up a significant increase was 
found in the threshold work load both at the AT and the IAT. The data 
demonstrated that warming-up has an advantageous effect on the efficiency of 
thermoregulation in endurance-trained athletes producing an early sweating 
response to the incremental exercise that results in attenuation of 
hyperthermia. An increase in the anaerobic threshold during incremental exercise 
preceded by warming-up may indicate an enhancement of the endurance capacity 
subsequent to warming-up."
2704923,"A 40-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of weakness and angina 
pectoris. She had generalised weakness of muscles, cold intolerance and a 
reduced physical performance. A previous neurological examination had already 
revealed a carpal-tunnel syndrome of the right hand. This syndrome, combined 
with a rough, cool skin and a periorbital edema, lead to the assumption of 
hypothyroidism. The diagnosis was confirmed by a combination of very high 
concentrations of TSH and decreased concentrations of the thyroid hormones. 
Replacement therapy by oral administration of L-thyroxin resulted in a gradual 
improvement of the patient's state."
2706800,"Renal angiomyolipomas were present in 23 out of a series of 38 patients with 
proven tuberous sclerosis (60.5%). Multiplicity and bilateral localization of 
combined renal angiomyolipomas were important differences between this category 
and the isolated, usually solitary, angiomyolipomas. One of the parents of a 
patient with tuberous sclerosis had small renal angiomyolipomas without signs of 
tuberous sclerosis. This indicates that renal angiomyolipomas might be a forme 
fruste of tuberous sclerosis. Two patients with suspected isolated renal 
angiomyolipomas proved to have tuberous sclerosis. From this study we can 
conclude that multiple angiomyolipomas, or a combination of a single renal 
hamartoma with one of the signs suggestive of tuberous sclerosis, warrant a 
thorough examination to exclude tuberous sclerosis."
2707289,"A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks 
after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide. Initially no major 
cholinergic features were observed. The ataxia of delayed onset was not 
accompanied by clinical or electrophysiological signs of polyneuropathy. The 
possible pathogenetic mechanisms are reviewed and discussed. This case 
illustrates the need to closely monitor all patients intoxicated with such 
chemicals for at least 5 weeks. One should not only keep in mind the well-known 
late-onset polyneuropathy, but also the less frequent delayed central nervous 
system effects, even in the milder cases where initial signs of acetylcholine 
excess are only minimally present or lacking."
2707392,"The distribution of anticonvulsant drug therapy was studied in 318 malformed 
infants with known histories of maternal epilepsy. Data on the infants was 
collected from six birth defect monitoring programs in Europe and South America. 
Use of specific types of anticonvulsants varies widely among reporting 
countries. Heterogeneity of drug-malformation distribution, was analyzed to 
determine whether use of specific drugs were linked to specific malformations. A 
significant association was seen between maternal use of valproic acid and spina 
bifida, and a weaker, non-significant one between carbamazepine and spina 
bifida. Facial clefts were associated with both diphenylhydantoin and 
phenobarbitone use and also with polytherapy. These differences indicate that 
the actual drug used is significant for the teratogenic process. The technique 
may be useful in analysis of other drug-related teratogenic questions."
2754219,"An increased incidence of small bowel lymphoma in patients with long-standing 
celiac sprue is well documented in the literature. Less common is the 
association of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. We report a patient with 
celiac sprue who initially responded to a gluten-free diet. Eighteen months 
later, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and bloating was found to have its origin in 
partial small bowel obstruction. At laparotomy, two distinct adenocarcinomas of 
the jejunum were resected. Celiac patients who initially respond to gluten 
withdrawal and subsequently suffer exacerbation while adhering to strict dietary 
therapy should be carefully evaluated for evidence of a small bowel malignancy."
2754447,"The risk of second cancers (SCs) was assessed in 744 patients with Hodgkin's 
disease (HD) admitted to The Netherlands Cancer Institute from 1966 to 1983. 
Sixty-nine SCs were observed one month or more after start of first treatment. 
These included 14 cases of lung cancer, nine cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
(NHL), 16 cases of leukemia, and six cases of the myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS). The median interval between the diagnosis of HD and that of second lung 
cancer, NHL, and leukemia was 8.1, 13.3, and 5.7 years, respectively. The 
overall relative risks (RR) (observed/expected [O/E] ratios) of developing lung 
cancer, NHL, and leukemia were 4.9 (95% confidence limit [CL], 2.7 to 8.2), 31.0 
(95% CL, 14.2 to 58.9) and 45.7 (95% CL, 26.1 to 74.2), respectively. At 15 
years the cumulative risk of developing an SC amounted to 20.6% +/- 2.9%. The 
15-year estimates of lung cancer, NHL, and leukemia were 6.2% +/- 1.9%, 5.9% +/- 
2.1% and 6.3% +/- 1.7%, respectively. Increased lung cancer risk following HD 
has not frequently been clearly demonstrated before; that we were able to 
demonstrate such risk may be due to the completeness of follow-up over long 
periods that could be achieved in this study. Excess lung cancer risk was only 
noted in treatment regimens with radiotherapy (RT); also, all lung cancers arose 
in irradiation fields. Excess risk of leukemia was only found in treatment 
regimens involving chemotherapy (CT). For NHL, combined modality treatment was 
shown to be the most important risk factor. Risk of lung cancer and NHL 
increased with time since diagnosis. A time-dependent covariate analysis (Cox 
model) performed on leukemia and MDS showed an increasing risk with intensity of 
CT, age (greater than 40 years), and a splenectomy."
2754585,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for the first time in the preoperative 
planning for separation of conjoined twins. In these omphalopagus infants, MRI 
showed normal biliary and cardiovascular structures and demonstrated, in detail, 
a relatively avascular plane through the liver bridge, which enabled safe 
separation with minimal blood loss at 3 1/2 months of age. A single MRI study 
supplied information superior to that obtained with multiple previously 
available imaging studies. MRI should be an essential part of the preoperative 
workup of all types of conjoined twins."
2756796,"In the present study the pineal gland was examined in 2 outbred stocks and 6 
inbred strains of rats some of which were pigmented to varying degrees, to see 
whether inbreeding affects the variability and whether differences exist between 
albino and pigmented rats. The animals were kept under 12 h light: 12 h darkness 
(12 L:12 D) and killed 7 h after the onset of light and darkness, respectively. 
The parameters examined were pineal protein content, serotonin and melatonin 
levels and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity. All the 
parameters examined revealed interstrain differences, independently of whether 
the data were expressed per pineal or per mg protein. The variation coefficients 
for the various parameters were relatively high. They were mostly smaller when 
the data were expressed per pineal rather than per mg protein. No striking 
differences existed between the variation coefficients in inbred and outbred 
rats. When pineal size and the melatonin-related parameters expressed per pineal 
were used to assess the melatonin-synthesizing capacity of the pineal glands, it 
was found that the outbred Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats and the inbred 
LEWIS-derived (LEW/Han) rats, all of which were albinos, had the most active 
pineals. Intermediate activity was noted in the hooded E3/Han and BDE/Han and 
the albino BDII/Han rats. The smallest and least active pineals were found in 
the totally pigmented BN/Han and DA/Han rats. The results taken together show 
that different stocks and strains exhibit significant differences in pineal size 
and melatonin-forming capacity. Albino rats appear to have larger and more 
active pineals than pigmented rats."
2759776,"In this paper we are reporting a retrospective study of patients under 18 years 
of age managed at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California 
Medical Center from January 1979 through December 1987 with the diagnosis of 
basilar skull fracture. Sixty-two patients with basilar skull fractures were 
admitted during that 7 1/2 year period. The most common etiology was pedestrain 
versus vehicle accidents (42%), followed by falls (27%), vehicle accidents 
(23%), and being hit by an object (8%). The most common physical findings were 
hemotympanum (58%) and bleeding in the ear canals (47%). Thirty-four percent of 
the patients complained of hearing loss. Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea was noted 
in 16 patients (26%), while only 1 patient had cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. 
Facial nerve paralysis was present in 8 patients (13%). Vestibular symptoms were 
rare. Sixty-three percent of the patients had the diagnosis confirmed by 
radiography. The clinical presentation, complications, management and outcome of 
basilar skull fractures in the pediatric population are discussed."
2760634,"The effect of levodopa (L-dopa), alone or in combination with a peripheral 
decarboxylase inhibitor (PDI), on plasma levels of aromatic-L-amino acid 
decarboxylase (ALAAD, = dopa decarboxylase), L-dopa, 3-O-methyl-dopa (3-OMD), 
dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been 
studied. In healthy subjects and in patients with parkinsonism plasma ALAAD 
level fell after administration of L-dopa + benserazide, but returned to 
previous levels within 90 min. In a cross-sectional study blood was obtained, 2 
h after dosing, from 104 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, divided into 
four groups: no L-dopa treatment (group 1), L-dopa alone (group 2), L-dopa + 
benserazide (Madopar) (group 3) and L-dopa + carbidopa (Sinemet) (group 4). 
Plasma ALAAD, which was normal in groups 1 and 2, was increased 3-fold in groups 
3 and 4, indicating that there was induction of ALAAD by the co-administration 
of PDI. Despite this induction of ALAAD, in groups 3 and 4, with half the daily 
L-dopa dose compared with group 2, plasma L-dopa and 3-OMD levels were 5 times 
higher, while plasma DA levels were not different. The DA/L-dopa ratio was 
decreased 5-fold in group 2 and 16-fold in groups 3 and 4 as compared with group 
1. Neither 3-OMD levels nor 3-OMD/L-dopa ratios correlated with the occurrence 
of on-off fluctuations. In a longitudinal study of three patients started on 
Madopar treatment the induction of plasma ALAAD was found to occur gradually 
over 3-4 weeks. Further detailed pharmacokinetic studies in plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid are required in order to elucidate whether the ALAAD 
induction by PDI may be related to the loss of clinical efficacy of combination 
therapy in some patients and how it is related to end-of-dose deterioration and 
on-off phenomena."
2765093,"The pathogenesis of enteric changes was studied in gnotobiotic piglets which, 
after hysterectomy had been infected orally with Campylobacter jejuni on the 
first day of their life. The involvement of the entire large intestine became 
clinically manifest by scouring on days post infection (DPI) 4 to DPI 5, and 
pathomorphologically, by simultaneous inflammation and severe edema of the 
intestinal wall. Histology and SEM revealed inflammatory edema with abundant 
neutrophils, microulcerations, focal propagation and activation of goblet cells, 
and a presence of mucin-positive material within the intestinal lumen. TEM 
examination revealed disconnected interdigitating folds and wide dilated 
intercellular spaces between enterocytes. The endothelial cells of small blood 
vessels in the lamina propria showed hypertrophy with increase in the thickness 
of their basal lamina. Ultrastructural lesions of the large intestinal 
microcirculation also support the hypothesis that disturbances in the vascular 
system are responsible for edema in the cecum and colon. Gnotobiotic piglets may 
be used as a suitable animal model to study colitis induced by C. jejuni."
2766606,"Eleven cases of sacroiliac dislocation and/or fracture (Malgaigne pattern) were 
successfully reduced and stabilized using two threaded compression rods. The 
mean follow-up period was 26.1 months (range, seven to 45 months). None of the 
implants failed and there was no subsequent displacement. Two patients had mild 
residual lower back pain, and one was treated with implant removal without 
subsequent relief of pain. One patient, in whom the operation was done 110 days 
after dislocation, had extension of an incomplete preoperative peroneal nerve 
palsy. After anterior pelvic ring stabilization has been performed, two threaded 
3/16-inch diameter rods are driven from the normal posterior iliac wing 
superficial to the sacrum and through the reduced opposite iliac wing. 
Compression is obtained with washers and nuts. This procedure can be performed 
safely and effectively, providing stable fixation and allowing early 
mobilization to help lessen or prevent the complications associated with 
prolonged bed rest."
2767161,"The mouse genome contains a major and a minor satellite DNA family of repetitive 
DNA sequences. The use of 5-azacytidine has allowed us to demonstrate that these 
satellite DNAs are organized in two separate domains at the centromeres of mouse 
chromosomes. The minor satellite is closer to the short arms of the acrocentric 
chromosomes than the major satellite. The major satellite is farther away, 
flanking the minor satellite and adjacent to the euchromatic long arm of each 
mouse chromosome. At the level of resolution afforded by the in situ 
hybridization technique it would appear that the organization of the centromeric 
domain of the mouse is similar to that in man. That is, both contain two 
repetitive DNA sequence families arranged in major blocks."
2769286,"Fifty patients suffering from the ""exploding head syndrome"" are described. This 
hitherto unreported syndrome is characterised by a sense of an explosive noise 
in the head usually in the twilight stage of sleep. The associated symptoms are 
varied, but the benign nature of the condition is emphasised and neither 
extensive investigation nor treatment are indicated."
2771275,"A family with the Romano-Ward syndrome is presented. This family showed typical 
features of this syndrome with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes ventricular 
tachycardia, sudden death and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The 
index case presented with an exacerbation of torsades de pointes ventricular 
tachycardia from diuretic induced hypokalaemia, and responded to diuretic 
withdrawal and beta blocker therapy."
2772682,"After a young woman had scarlet fever associated with group C beta-hemolytic 
streptococcal pharyngitis, we reviewed all cases of pharyngitis treated at a 
student health clinic during that semester. From 541 cases of pharyngitis, 34 
cultures yielded group C Streptococcus. The patients who harbored group C 
organisms were similar to the patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis in 
the presence of fever, exudate, and cervical adenopathy. The severity of 
symptoms and the demonstration of scarlet fever developing from infection with 
this organism supports antibiotic treatment of patients with group C 
streptococcal pharyngitis."
2773621,"T3 and GH have been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. 
Since thyroid hormone promotes the synthesis of growth hormone, its control of 
human mitochondrial biogenesis could arise through a permissive action on GH 
biosynthesis. This was studied in hypophysectomized rats treated with T3 and/or 
human GH by the continuous infusion of hormone for 6 days from mini-infusion 
pumps implanted sc. Increases in mitochondrial respiration, enzyme activities, 
and protein synthesis were found in isolated liver mitochondria from rats 
receiving T3. In contrast, GH alone had no effect, nor did it increase the 
response to T3. Since it has been argued that mitochondrial biogenesis results 
from a direct interaction (binding) of GH with mitochondria, GH-specific binding 
sites were measured with 125I-bGH, a specific somatogenic receptor ligand, in 
isolated mitochondrial membranes in vitro. In addition, the intracellular 
endocytic uptake of 125I-bGH injected in vivo was compared in purified 
subcellular membrane fractions and mitochondria. No evidence in favour of 
specific GH interaction on mitochondrial membranes was found by either test. It 
is concluded that T3 exerts a direct, rather than permissive, effect on 
mitochondrial biogenesis, and that high affinity binding sites for GH are not 
present in rat liver mitochondria."
2774513,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare, progressive, fatal central nervous 
system disease of children, is caused by measles virus. Clinical signs occur 
months to several years after recovery from acute measles infection. It is not 
known where the virus persists while the disease is inapparent. Involvement of 
organs outside the central nervous system has rarely been documented. To search 
for possible peripheral reservoirs of measles virus we used in situ 
hybridization to probe for measles virus RNA and immunocytochemical studies to 
localize measles virus antigens ina variety of organs taken at autopsy from 
confirmed cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Seven of 9 cadavers were 
found to contain measles virus RNA or antigens, or both, in at least one 
location outside the central nervous system. These sites included lymphoid 
organs such as thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and tonsil, suggesting a role for 
lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis. Virus was also detected in kidney, lung, 
and glandular tissues such as pancreas, adrenal, and pituitary. These reservoirs 
may provide the antigenic stimulus leading to the elevated response 
characteristic for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis."
2775668,"Individuals who undergo removal of an acoustic neuroma are usually apprehensive 
in spite of the intrinsically benign nature of the disease. Fears surrounding 
the experience are related to the real risks involved in surgery near the brain 
and the complications which can ensue. The intensity of the patients' feelings 
of anxiety and uncertainty might be decreased if nurses were aware of and 
attended to the informational needs of these patients. In order to describe the 
informational needs of acoustic neuroma patients, a retrospective survey of 21 
subjects who had had removal of such a tumor six to eighteen months previously 
was carried out. The survey determined: (1) the type of information patients 
received preoperatively and postoperatively (2) the type of information patients 
wanted (3) the type of problems experienced postoperatively and (4) the length 
and severity of the problems if they occurred. Content analysis indicated that 
the majority of subjects experienced tiredness, depression, headache, and 
dryness of eyes and mouth in the postoperative and convalescent phases. The 
actual illness experience persisted much longer than the subjects had expected. 
Subjects expressed explicit informational needs related to self-management after 
the surgery. The implications for nursing care will be discussed and the 
recommendations for an interdisciplinary patient education programme will be 
outlined."
2775757,"The amino acid sequence and disulfide bridges of bovine plasma derived 
angiogenin were determined by sequencer analysis of the intact protein and 
fragments derived by enzymatic and chemical digestion. Bovine angiogenin is a 
single-chain protein of 125 amino acids; it contains six cysteines and has a 
calculated molecular weight of 14,595. In contrast to the human protein its 
amino terminus is unblocked. It has the following sequence: 
H2N-Ala1-Gln-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe10-Leu-Thr-Gln-His-Tyr -Asp-Ala-Lys- 
Pro-Lys20-Gly-Arg-Asn-Asp-Glu-Tyr-Cys-Phe-Asn-Met30-Met-Lys- Asn-Arg-Arg-Leu-Thr

Cys(27)-Cys(82), Cys(40)-Cys(93), and Cys(58)-Cys(108). Bovine angiogenin is 64% 
identical with human angiogenin; like the human protein, it is homologous to the 
pancreatic ribonucleases, with conservation of active site residues. Two 
regions, 6-22 and 65-75, are highly conserved between the angiogenins but are 
significantly different from those of the ribonucleases, suggesting a possible 
role in the molecules' biological activity."
2781955,"Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with thionamide, lithium or 
radioactive iodine is ineffective. This particular form of hyperthyroidism is 
long-lasting because of the slow elimination of amiodarone. Therefore, an 
alternative therapy is necessary, especially for patients who need to continue 
permanent administration of the drug. We report 2 cases of AIT: in one case, 
amiodarone was interrupted; in the other case, amiodarone was continued because 
of recurrent ventricular tachycardia resistant to classical antiarrhythmic 
drugs. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and 
dexamethasone (DXT)."
2790826,"Detailed job histories and information about other suspected risk factors were 
obtained during interviews with 272 men aged 25-69 with a primary brain tumor 
first diagnosed during 1980-1984 and with 272 individually matched neighbor 
controls. Separate analyses were conducted for the 202 glioma pairs and the 70 
meningioma pairs. Meningioma, but not glioma, was related to having a serious 
head injury 20 or more years before diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) = 2.3; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.4], and a clear dose-response effect was 
observed relating meningioma risk to number of serious head injuries (P for 
trend = 0.01; OR for greater than or equal to 3 injuries = 6.2; CI = 1.2-31.7). 
Frequency of full-mouth dental X-ray examinations after age 25 related to both 
glioma (P for trend = 0.04) and meningioma risk (P for trend = 0.06). Glioma, 
but not meningioma risk, related to duration of prior employment in jobs likely 
to involve high exposure to electric and magnetic fields (P for trend = 0.05). 
This risk was greatest for astrocytoma (OR for employment in such jobs for 
greater than 5 years = 4.3; CI = 1.2-15.6). More glioma cases had worked in the 
rubber industry (discordant pairs 6/1) and more worked in hot processes using 
plastics (9/1). More meningioma cases had jobs that involved exposure to metal 
dusts and fumes (discordant pairs 13/5), and six of these cases and two controls 
worked as machinists. Finally, there was a protective effect among glioma pairs 
relating to frequency of use of vitamin C and other vitamin supplements (P for 
trend = 0.004); the OR for use at least twice a day was 0.4 (CI = 0.2-0.8)."
2793186,"In situ hybridization of five new and one previously described alpha-satellite 
sequences isolated from chromosome 21 libraries gave the following chromosomal 
distribution patterns: (a) two sequences (pTRA-1 and -4) hybridizing to 
chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 (also 19 and 20); (b) one sequence (pTRA-7) 
hybridizing to chromosome 14; and (c) three sequences (pTRA-2, -11 and -15) 
hybridizing to chromosomes 13, 14, and 21, with significant but weaker signals 
on 15 and 22. These results suggested the sharing of alphoid domains between 
different acrocentric chromosomes and the coexistence of multiple domains on 
each chromosome. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids carrying a single human 
acrocentric chromosome using pTRA-2 demonstrated a higher-order repeating 
structure common to chromosomes 13, 14, and 21, but not to 15 and 22, providing 
direct evidence for sequence homogenization in this domain among the former 
three chromosomes. We present a model of evolution and genetic exchange of alpha 
sequences on the acrocentric chromosomes which can satisfactorily explain these 
and previous observations of (a) two different alphoid subfamilies, one common 
to chromosomes 13 and 21 and the other common to chromosomes 14 and 22, (b) a 
different alphoid subfamily on chromosome 22, and (c) nonrandom participation of 
chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 in Robertsonian translocations."
2794625,"Morton's neuroma is regarded as a type of entrapment neuropathy, therefore, 
neurolysis as surgical treatment is preferable to neurectomy. We have developed 
a new surgical procedure which consists of a plantar zigzag incision, incision 
of the plantar aponeurosis, and microsurgical neurolysis of the interdigital 
nerve. We have performed this operation on 6 nerves with Morton's neuroma in 5 
patients and obtained excellent results. The remaining one nerve showed fair 
results. Neurectomy of the interdigital nerve has been regarded as the surgical 
treatment of choice for Morton's neuroma. However, a resection neuroma and 
permanent sensory deficit are inevitable sequelae after neurectomy. Since 
Morton's neuroma is considered to be a type of entrapment neuropathy, it is 
reasonable to think that neurolysis is preferable to neurectomy. We have 
developed a renewed procedure of microsurgical neurolysis on nerves involved 
with Morton's neuroma. Using this procedure, we operated 6 nerves with Morton's 
neuroma on 5 patients and obtained excellent results, which forms the basis of 
this report."
2795066,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been recognised as the most 
sensitive method with which to detect clinically silent lesions in patients 
affected by multiple sclerosis. Visually guided horizontal saccadic eye 
movements (SEM) were studied, together with MRI, in 57 multiple sclerosis 
patients. A very similar sensitivity was found for both MRI (78.2%) and SEM 
analysis (76.3%). Significant associations between peak saccadic velocity and 
brain stem signs and between saccadic latency and visual signs were observed."
2797370,"The authors report a case of acute spinal epidural hematoma occurring in a 
patient receiving antiplatelet drugs. A 76-year-old man with a history of 
cerebral infarction had been taking antiplatelet agents for one year. He 
suddenly developed severe back pain which woke him from sleep, and numbness of 
his lower extremities was then noted. He was hospitalized 15 hours later. 
Neurological examination revealed flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities 
with negative Babinski's reflex, and sensory disturbance below the level of L1. 
The bleeding time and prothrombin time were prolonged. Computed tomographic (CT) 
scan revealed a biconvex, relatively hyperdense mass in the posterior spinal 
canal at the level of T12. Metrizamide myelography disclosed an incomplete 
blockage caused by an epidural mass at the level of T11. Post-myelographic CT 
scan demonstrated a sharply demarcated extradural filling defect at the level of 
T11. Seventeen hours after the onset of symptoms, an emergency laminectomy was 
performed extending from T12 to L3, and the epidural clot was totally evacuated. 
Histological examination of the capsule of the hematoma revealed no vascular 
anomalies. The patient made a good postoperative recovery. To the authors' 
knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous intraspinal hemorrhage 
in a patient taking antiplatelet drugs. Acute onset of persistent pain anywhere 
along the spinal axis and the development of spinal neurological deficits in a 
patient on antiplatelet therapy should raise the suspicion of a spinal epidural 
hematoma. It should be stressed that prompt neuroradiological diagnosis and 
rapid surgical decompression are essential to allow good recovery. The present 
case illustrates that neurological emergencies can occur in patients receiving 
antiplatelet therapy."
2798270,"The clinical features and morphological findings in 31 Japanese infants with 
trisomy 18 are presented. The majority were small-for-date infants. There was no 
sex predominance in our series, as opposed to male:female ratios of 1:3 reported

males. Cardiovascular anomalies were consistently present; ventricular septar 
defect and patent ductus arteriosus being the most common malformations. Various 
other internal malformations including the Arnold-Chiari malformation were 
observed."
2803131,"Results in 136 hyperprolactinaemic women who presented with infertility, 
amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and/or galactorrhoea are reported. There 
was radiographic evidence of pituitary microadenoma in 21 (15.4%) patients and 5 
(3.7%) had macroadenoma. Four patients were taking antidepressants, 2 
antihypertensive drugs and 7 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 6 
months to 5 years. The remaining patients had no obvious cause for elevated 
prolactin levels. Patients with pituitary adenoma had a significantly higher (p 
less than 0.001) baseline serum prolactin level (182 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) than those 
with no adenoma (59.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml). All patients in the study were treated 
with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a 
pregnancy. The patients without an adenoma required a significantly smaller dose 
of bromocriptine (2.5-5.0 mg) (p less than 0.005) than those with an adenoma. 
Galactorrhoea disappeared in all 64 patients within 2-4 months of treatment, 
sixty-six (71%) of the 93 patients who desired pregnancy achieved it within 3 to 
8 months of bromocriptine therapy; 32 of these patients received additional 
treatment with clomiphene and human chorionic gonadotrophins for induction of 
ovulation. In the remaining 70 patients menstruation became regular and 
ovulation was evident in 40% of them. There was no significant difference in the 
pregnancy rate between the patients with or without pituitary adenoma. 
Similarly, presence of galactorrhoea or a high level of prolactin did not 
influence the pregnancy rate. No complications were observed during pregnancy 
related to pituitary adenomas; 8 (12%) pregnancies ended in first trimester 
abortion. No lethal congenital fetal abnormalities were observed in the patients 
treated with bromocriptine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2804053,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in the modulation of the catabolism of 
chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants. ApoE has three 
major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 
and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated 
with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). We describe 
a new variant of apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, which is, in contrast to apoE-2, 
dominantly associated with type III HLP. Five of twelve members of the affected 
kindred are heterozygous for the mutant form of apoE, and four of the five have 
type III HLP, while the fifth member has dysbetalipoproteinemia on diet therapy. 
Neuraminidase digestion, which removes charged sialic acid residues, did not 
alter the electrophoretic position of the apoE-1Harrisburg isoprotein, 
indicating that the altered charge of apoE-1Harrisburg was not due to sialic 
acid addition to the apolipoprotein. Cysteamine modification, which adds a 
positively charged group to cysteine, resulted in a shift of apoE-1Harrisburg 
from the E-1 to the E-2 isoform position, indicating that there is one cysteine 
in apoE-1Harrisburg as is the case for apoE-3. These results are consistent with 
apoE-1Harrisburg originating in the allele for apoE-3 with the mutation leading 
to a negative two-unit charge shift. The definitive identification of a kindred 
with an apoE variant, apoE-1Harrisburg, dominantly associated with 
dysbetalipoproteinemia and type III HLP provides a unique opportunity to gain 
important insights into the structure-function requirements of the E 
apolipoprotein as well as the mechanisms by which apoE modulates lipoprotein 
metabolism."
2806531,"The binding of sodium salicylate, sodium mefenamate, ortophen and piroxicam to 
membranes of erythrocyte ghosts and the effects of the drugs on the membrane 
microviscosity in carrageenan-induced inflammation were studied by the 
fluorescent probe method. It was shown that under inflammation the membrane 
microviscosity decreases and concurrently the affinity of the studied compounds 
to them increases. Antiphlogistics were found to enhance the membrane viscosity 
both in control and under inflammation. The possible mechanisms of the described 
effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents on biomembranes are discussed."
2807143,"Significant increases in the concentration of plasma glucagon-like 
immunoreactivity (GLI) and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and 
triglycerides (TG) concomitant with decreases in circulating levels of thyroxine 
(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and T3/T4 ratio were observed in homing pigeons, 
untrained for 3 months, after a flight of 48 km lasting 90-160 min. The 
increased level of FFA is attributed to glucagon stimulated lipolysis. The 
elevation of TG levels may be due to altered partitioning and utilization of 
lipoprotein in adipose tissue and muscle. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 
ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination 
with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may 
represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during 
strenuous and extended flight."
2807674,"The Japanese Committee for the National Registry of Subacute Sclerosing 
Panencephalitis (SSPE) confirmed that 215 cases of SSPE occurred in the 20 years 
from 1966 to 1985, as discovered in the 10-year surveillance from April 1976 
through March 1986. The annual incidence in recent years has been between 10 and 
23 cases. Among cases with a certain history of measles illness or measles 
vaccination, 184 (90.2%) had a history of measles illness without receiving 
measles vaccine. There were 11 probable measles vaccine-associated cases (5.4%), 
three (1.5%) being vaccinated with a combined use of killed and live vaccine and 
eight (3.9%) with further attenuated live vaccine. There were nine cases (4.4%) 
without a history of either measles illness or measles vaccination. Intervals 
between measles illness and the onset of SSPE varied from 1 to 16 years (mean, 
7.0 years). The periods following measles vaccination with further attenuated 
live vaccine were 2 to 11 years (mean, 4.6 years). Annual incidence rates of 
SSPE per million cases of measles ranged between 6.1 and 40.9 (mean, 16.1) in 
the 10 measles epidemic years 1968-1977, and those following vaccination with 
further attenuated live vaccine were zero in most years and at the highest 3.08 
(mean, 0.9) per million doses of distributed vaccine."

2813401,"Specific binding of angiogenin (ANG) to calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells 
was demonstrated. Cellular binding at 4 degrees C of 125I-labeled human 
recombinant ANG was time and concentration dependent, reversible, and saturable 
in the presence of increasing amounts of the unlabeled molecules. The 
interaction was shown to be specific since a large excess of unlabeled ANG 
reduced labeled ANG binding by 80%, whereas similar doses of RNase A, a 
structurally related protein, had no effect. Scatchard analyses of binding data 
revealed two apparent components. High-affinity sites with an apparent 
dissociation constant of 5 x 10(-9) M were shown to represent cell-specific 
interactions. The second component, comprising low-affinity/high-capacity sites 
with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.2 x 10(-6) M, was essentially 
associated with pericellular components. High-affinity ANG binding sites varied 
with cell density and were found on other endothelial cells from bovine aorta, 
cornea, and adrenal cortex capillary but not on Chinese hamster lung 
fibroblasts. Divalent copper, a modulator of angiogenesis, was found to induce a 
severalfold increase in specific cell-bound radioactivity. Placental 
ribonuclease inhibitor, a tight-binding inhibitor of both ribonucleolytic and 
angiogenic activities of ANG, abolished 125I-labeled human recombinant ANG 
binding only in the absence of copper."
2816867,"A retrospective study examined early neurodevelopmental behaviors of children 
with spastic diplegia, spastic hemiplegia, and quadriplegia (spastic, athetoid, 
or mixed) who had been followed up longitudinally in a high-risk infant 
follow-up clinic. Compared with peers with normal outcomes, children with all 
three types of cerebral palsy had significantly lower scores on the Bayley 
Mental Scale at 4 months of age; children with hemiplegia and quadriplegia also 
scored significantly lower on the Bayley Motor Scale. On the Movement Assessment 
of Infants at 4 months of age, the children with hemiplegia and quadriplegia 
showed significantly higher risk scores than the nonhandicapped group. The 
Movement Assessment of Infants was more than three times as sensitive as the 
Bayley Motor Scale in detecting motor abnormalities in 4-month-old infants with 
diplegia and more than twice as sensitive in detecting early abnormalities of 
hemiplegia. At 1 year of age, however, the Bayley Motor Scale was extremely 
sensitive in picking up motor deficits in children with all three types of 
cerebral palsy."
2819350,"PIP: A case control study of rheumatoid arthritis and oral contraceptives (OC) 
or postmenopausal hormones was begun in women aged 20 in 2 hospitals in Athens, 
with same hospital, age-matched controls. Cases have diagnosed definite or 
classical rheumatoid arthritis and are being treated in rheumatology clinics. To 
date 135 cases and 104 controls have been interviewed. 5 cases (3.7%) and 5 
controls (4.8% used OCs, with a mean duration of 2 years for both, giving a 
relative risk of 0.76. 8 more cases and 6 controls were found who used OC for 
regulation of their menstrual cycle. 1.5% of cases and 3.8% of controls had used 
post-menopausal hormones. Univariate analysis showed that the cases had later 
menarche and fewer pregnancies and live births. Multiple regression analysis did 
not find OC or postmenopausal hormones significantly linked with rheumatoid 
arthritis. Number of pregnancies and children, however, were significantly 
higher in controls. Because of the small numbers and low power of the study, 
more subjects are being collected."
2820585,"The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the product of t(9:22), is the cytogenetic 
hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is 
translocated to the Ph chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region 
(bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This results in the formation of a 
bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA 
encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The Ph chromosome is also found in 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Although the c-abl is translocated and a 
new 190 kd c-abl protein has been identified, no breakpoints are observed in the 
bcr (Ph+bcr- ALL). Here we show that in Ph+bcr- ALL, breakpoints in chromosome 
22 occur within the same bcr gene, but more 5' of the bcr. Cloning of a chimeric 
bcr-c-abl cDNA demonstrates that the fusion gene is transcribed into a 7 kb 
mRNA, encoding a novel fusion protein."
2820967,"Amiloride is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis in mammalian cells in culture. 
Recent evidence indicates that the enzyme, DNA topoisomerase II, is probably 
required for DNA synthesis to occur in situ. In experiments to determine the 
mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that 
amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II 
in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many 
compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. 
Thus, we performed studies to determine if and how amiloride bound to DNA. 
Results indicated that amiloride 1) shifted the thermal denaturation profile of 
DNA, 2) increased the viscosity of linear DNA, and 3) unwound circular DNA, all 
behavior consistent with a DNA intercalation mechanism. Furthermore, 
quantitative and qualitative measurements of amiloride fluorescence indicated 
that amiloride (a) bound reversibly to purified DNA under conditions of 
physiologic ionic strength, and (b) bound to purified nuclei in a highly 
cooperative manner. Lastly, amiloride did not promote the cleavage of DNA in the 
presence of DNA topoisomerase II, indicating that the mechanism by which 
amiloride inhibited DNA topoisomerase II was not through the stabilization of a 
""cleavable complex"" formed between DNA topoisomerase II, DNA, and amiloride. The 
ability of amiloride to intercalate with DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II is 
consistent with the proposed planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic nature of 
amiloride's most stable conformation. Thus, DNA and DNA topoisomerase II must be 
considered as new cellular targets of amiloride action."
2827818,"A histological analysis was conducted in 138 female breast cancer patients, and 
the results were classified in accordance with ""Histological Typing of Breast 
Tumours"" (WHO, Geneva 1981). Since about half of these tumors showed more than 
one histological type of carcinoma, a simplified classification system with four 
groups was adopted. When patients were categorized according to the number and 
degree of kinship of their relatives with breast cancer, no specific association 
with the histological types was found. Familial tumors also encompassed a wide 
spectrum of histopathologic diagnoses. This suggests the absence of a 
histological marker in familial breast cancer. Pedigrees of all the patients 
were then analyzed, special emphasis being placed on relatives suffering from 
the same and other malignancies. It was found that 13.8% of the probands had at 
least one first-degree relative with breast cancer and that, compared with the 
tumor spectra in the male and female population, there was a significantly 
higher number of esophageal carcinomas in the fathers, of stomach cancers in the 
uncles and grandfathers, of brain tumors in the mothers, and of sarcomas in the 
brothers. An accumulation of the same tumors, especially stomach cancer and 
tumors related to the SBLA syndrome, was observed in families of index patients 
with tubular or medullary breast cancer. The SBLA syndrome is a complex familial 
cancer syndrome characterized by a proclivity to Sarcomas, Breast cancers, brain 
tumors, Lung and laryngeal cancers, leukemia, and Adrenocortical carcinomas."
2830793,"The isolated working heart preparation was used to investigate the effect of 
continuous triiodothyronine (T3) administration on cardiac function and 
metabolism of rats rendered diabetic for a period of 4 wk with streptozocin 
(STZ). T3 controlled-release pellets were implanted 1 wk after STZ (70 mg/kg) 
injection. Rats injected with citrate buffer without STZ received T3 pellets 1 
and/or 2 wk later. A comparable number of rats received placebo pellets. 
Untreated diabetic rats exhibited a decrease in spontaneous heart rate and 
myocardial cytochrome c concentrations concurrent with depressed plasma T3 
values compared with untreated controls. T3 treatment did not improve in vitro 
cardiac performance (assessed as cardiac output times peak systolic pressure per 
gram dry heart weight) in hearts from diabetic rats perfused with glucose alone. 
Addition of octanoate reversed this depression and improved cardiac function to 
a greater extent in treated than in untreated diabetic animals. However, these 
differences between treated and untreated diabetic animals disappeared when 
heart rate was controlled by cardiac pacing. Furthermore, T3 treatment of 
controls and diabetics did not alter the oxidation of octanoate or the cardiac 
responsiveness to isoproterenol. These results suggest that experimental 
diabetic cardiomyopathy is partly attributable to a substrate deficiency and is 
not due entirely to hypothyroidism."
2831495,"We report a new subfamily of alpha satellite DNA (pTRA-2) which is found on all 
the human acrocentric chromosomes. The alphoid nature of the cloned DNA was 
established by partial sequencing. Southern analysis of restriction 
enzyme-digested DNA fragments from mouse/human hybrid cells containing only 
human chromosome 21 showed that the predominant higher-order repeating unit for 
pTRA-2 is a 3.9 kb structure. Analysis of a ""consensus"" in situ hybridisation 
profile derived from 13 normal individuals revealed the localisation of 73% of 
all centromeric autoradiographic grains over the five acrocentric chromosomes, 
with the following distribution: 20.4%, 21.5%, 17.1%, 7.3% and 6.5% on 
chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 15 and 22 respectively. An average of 1.4% of grains was 
found on the centromere of each of the remaining 19 nonacrocentric chromosomes. 
These results indicate the presence of a common subfamily of alpha satellite DNA 
on the five acrocentric chromosomes and suggest an evolutionary process 
consistent with recombination exchange of sequences between the nonhomologues. 
The results further suggests that such exchanges are more selective for 
chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 than for chromosomes 15 and 22. The possible role of 
centromeric alpha satellite DNA in the aetiology of 13q14q and 14q21q 
Robertsonian translocations involving the common and nonrandom association of 
chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 is discussed."

2832821,"A familial observation of hypophosphatemic rickets with unusual inheritance and 
evolution, different from that of X linked hypophosphatemia, is reported. The 
mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant, a father and his son being affected. 
Severe early signs of rickets and delayed growth were present in both cases. 
Plasma 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH levels were normal. There was no 
hypercalciuria. Complete cure of rickets and catch-up growth were obtained with 
the only treatment of vitamin D (40,000 U/day) in the father and of 1 alpha 
hydroxyvitamin D (1 microgram/day) in the son. This observation is quite similar 
to the 'autosomal hypophosphatemic bone disease' described by Scriver et al. It 
illustrates the heterogeneity of familial hypophosphatemia which presently 
includes 4 different physiopathological entities."
2833535,"Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder 
caused by an IgG-mediated reduction in number of presynaptic voltage-gated 
calcium channels (VGCC) at the neuromuscular junction. In at least 50% of cases, 
the stimulus for antibody production may be VGCC on small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC). In this study membranes isolated from a human small cell lung cancer 
xenograft (Mar), that bound [3H]PN200-110, a VGCC antagonist, were subjected to 
Western blotting using plasma from 12 LEMS patients and eight controls. Although 
one band recognised by 3/12 LEMS IgGs might be associated with the VGCC, a 
number of other proteins were recognised both by LEMS plasma, and by plasma from 
patients with other disorders. The results illustrate the difficulties found 
using Western blotting with autoimmune plasma to identify specific polypeptides 
in a crude antigen preparation."
2837434,"alpha-Galactosidase and beta-galactosidase activities have been determined in 
leukocyte preparations from 100 randomly selected Chinese adults. For 
alpha-galactosidase, two groups with low activities were identified: group I 
consisted of 3 females having activities below 40% of normal, and group II 
consisted of 5 males and 1 female with activities about 60% of normal. Family 
studies suggested that these low alpha-galactosidase activities are genetically 
determined. Only 1 individual was found to have about 50% of normal 
beta-galactosidase activity; presumably he is a carrier for beta-galactosidase 
deficiency (GM1 gangliosidosis)."
2840207,"Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants indicate that neither topoisomerase 
I nor II appears to be essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. 
However, plasmids carrying transcriptionally active genes are found to be 
extremely negatively supercoiled when isolated from mutants lacking 
topoisomerase I. Supercoiling occurs during transcriptional elongation rather 
than during transcriptional activation. It takes place in the absence of 
topoisomerase I and does not seem to be dependent on topoisomerase II since it 
can occur at the nonpermissive temperature in a top1-top2 ts mutant. Whether 
this change in linking number is due to an unusual form of topoisomerase II or 
whether it is due to a new enzyme has yet to be determined. The results suggest 
that topoisomerase I is normally required to relax transcriptionally induced 
supercoils. A model is discussed which considers the role of topoisomerases in 
the movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template."
2842762,"Since DNA topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) is an essential enzyme in yeast, 
heterologous topoisomerase II gene expression in yeast cells can provide a 
system for analyzing the structure and function of topoisomerase II genes from 
other species. A series of yeast expression plasmids was constructed in which 
segments of the cDNA sequences encoding Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II were 
inserted under the transcriptional control of yeast GAL1 promoter. Expression of 
the functional form of Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA can complement 
conditionally lethal, temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast topoisomerase 
II gene (TOP2), as well as mutations in which the TOP2 locus was disrupted. The 
survival of these yeast cells depends upon the continuous expression of 
Drosophila topoisomerase II. Repression of Drosophila gene expression by glucose 
causes these yeast cells to cease dividing after a few generations. In addition 
to these genetic complementation data, the expression of the Drosophila 
topoisomerase II gene in yeast cells with a disruption in TOP2 can also be 
detected by immunochemical methods with an antibody specific for Drosophila 
topoisomerase II."
2885758,"The human Y chromosome is composed of two different parts: a pseudoautosomal 
region shared with the X chromosome which is responsible for sex chromosome 
pairing and a Y-specific part that encodes the sex determining gene. Previously 
we have shown that the pseudoautosomal gene MIC2 only rarely recombines between 
the sex chromosomes and, based on the elevated recombination rates in the 
pseudoautosomal region, we predicted that this gene would lie close to the 
Y-specific region. In this report we describe a test of this prediction using 
long-range restriction mapping techniques. We conclude that MIC2 is less than 
200 kilobases (kb) away from Y-specific sequences. During these experiments we 
have identified an HTF island in a position consistent with the proposed 
location of the human sex determining gene."
2885829,"Known since 1967 and usually familial, the syndrome of tissue resistance to 
thyroid hormones may take one of two different forms, depending on the receptors 
involved. When resistance affects both peripheral and pituitary receptors, 
plasma thyroid hormone levels are high despite the lack of thyrotoxicosis, 
thyroxine and triiodothyronine are ineffective, even in high dosage, and plasma 
TSH increases to explode under TRH. When resistance only affects pituitary 
receptors, there is moderate thyrotoxicosis with paradoxical and inappropriate 
TSH increase. Contrary to expectations, nuclear receptors to triiodothyronine 
are perturbed in only a few cases. Reduction of thyrotropic hyperfunction, which 
is the primary purpose of treatment, can be achieved with D-forms of thyroid 
hormones or with somatostatin and its derivatives."
2886666,"Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A2

results showed that the fetus inherited the normal COL1A2 allele from her

dominantly inherited osteogenesis imperfecta."
2888163,"Syrian golden hamsters when allowed free access to food and an exercise wheel 
will run long distances and develop hyperphagia and accelerated linear body 
growth with high circulating levels of growth hormone and insulin. Somatostatin, 
a widely distributed brain-gut neurohormonal peptide, modulates nutrient 
absorption and may regulate food intake. To examine the role of circulating 
plasma somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI; pg/ml) in exercise induced 
hyperphagia 4 groups of animals were studied; an unrestricted exercise group 
(279.0 +/- 107.7, n = 10); a sedentary group (121.1 +/- 40.8, n = 8); a 
restricted exercise group (107.7 +/- 12.4, n = 6); and a restricted no exercise 
group (115.5 +/- 45.9, n = 9). Thus, the unrestricted exercise group has a 
significantly elevated SRIF-LI concentration (P less than 0.01) while there was 
no difference between the other 3 groups. The elevation of plasma SRIF-LI in the 
unrestricted exercise group may represent a response to modulate increased 
nutrient entry in this group or may represent an incompletely effective satiety 
signal."
2893240,"In anaesthesia and in the intensive care unit, benzodiazepines have proven safe 
and effective agents for the induction and maintenance of sedation for a variety 
of therapeutic goals. However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose, 
it is often desirable to be able to terminate or interrupt sedation without 
waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine to become dissipated by normal 
metabolism and excretion. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly 
effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when 
the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. 
It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by 
competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration 
occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient 
by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in 
anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short 
elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesia or conscious 
to moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose of flumazenil is 
usually sufficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness. 
After intoxication with high benzodiazepine doses, the duration of effect of a 
single dose of flumazenil is not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, the 
period of wakefulness can be prolonged as necessary by repeated low intravenous 
doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerated 
both systemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with greater 
frequency after flumazenil compared with placebo were nausea and/or vomiting 
after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actual vomiting was not 
significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtually 
absent in studies of intensive care patients and after sedation for short 
procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers 
receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between 
these symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, some of which 
have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and 
effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of 
benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced 
general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, 
either alone or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

2894813,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the etiological agent of adult 
T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, also appears to be the cause of tropical spastic 
paraparesis, a chronic myelopathy reported in several different regions of the 
world. The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I in patients with chronic 
neurodegenerative disorders other than tropical spastic paraparesis and in 
patients with some muscle inflammatory disorders has been investigated. IgG 
antibodies to HTLV-I were measured in the sera and/or cerebrospinal fluid from 
82 Guamanian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
parkinsonism-dementia, 164 Guamanian normal controls, 10 patients with kuru from 
the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, 4 patients with Viliuisk 
encephalomyelitis from the Iakut region of eastern Siberia, 45 Italian patients 
with multiple sclerosis, and 56 patients with polymyositis (49 from the United 
States and 7 from Jamaica). As determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
Western immunoblot, and gelatin particle agglutination techniques, serological 
evidence of HTLV-I infection was found in 1 patient with amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and 1 control subject from Guam, and in 1 patient from the United 
States and all 7 Jamaican patients with polymyositis. Except for the high 
seropositivity rate among the group of Jamaican patients with polymyositis, our 
data indicate that HTLV-I is an unlikely causative agent in the spectrum of the 
neurological diseases examined. The seropositivity of the 7 Jamaican patients 
with polymyositis requires further study."
2895008,"In vivo binding of the benzamide derivative [3H]raclopride was studied in mouse 
brain. The binding was saturable, reversible and stereospecific. Non-specific 
binding was 5-15% of the total binding. Pharmacological characterization of the 
binding indicated labelling of dopamine D2 receptors since the binding was 
potently inhibited by compounds with high affinity for this receptor in vitro. 
On the other hand, compounds with low affinity in vitro i.e., dopamine 
D1-selective compounds were weak or inactive as inhibitors of [3H]raclopride 
binding. A comparison of the pharmacological characteristics of [3H]raclopride 
and [3H]SCH 23390 binding in vivo indicated that compounds with selectivity in 
vitro retained this selectivity in vivo. Thus, spiroperidol, haloperidol, 
1-sulpiride, clebopride, LY 171555 and (-)-NPA ((-)-N-propyl-norapomorphine) 
were D2 selective while SCH 23390, SKF 38393 and SKF 75670 were D1 selective. 
Clozapine, tilozepine, cis-flupentixol, chlorpromazine and butaclamol were 
non-selective both in vitro and in vivo. However, a few compounds changed 
profile in vivo compared to in vitro. Thus, fluperlapine and fluphenazine had a 
dual D1-D2 receptor profile in vitro but were D1- or D2-selective in vivo, 
respectively. Pergolide and molindone which were D2-selective in vitro both had 
a dual D1-D2 receptor profile in vivo. In conclusion, [3H]raclopride, in vivo, 
selectively labels the dopamine D2 receptor. Comparison of the pharmacological 
characteristics of [3H]raclopride and [3H]SCH 23390 binding in vivo supported 
the that the dopamine D1 receptor is an important target for a variety of 
neuroleptics, especially of the clozapine type. This may indicate that blockade 
of the dopamine D1 receptor conveys antipsychotic action."
2899985,"Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist 
of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions 
within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In general, 
a total dose of 0.3-0.8 mg will be sufficient in clinical practice, avoiding 
side effects like nausea, tremor, sweating, or transient anxiety that could be 
observed when higher dosages were administered. Its therapeutic range is very 
high as could be demonstrated in experimental animal in which up to 8.000-fold 
the clinical dose was administered. The total volume of distribution (Vdes) 
amounts to nearly 1.000 ml/kg BW and the total clearance exceeds 1.200 ml/min, 
resulting in a biological half-life of less than 60 min. According to the 
benzodiazepine dosage and the rapid plasma concentration decline of flumazenil, 
in some cases a resedation could be observed. Hence, a careful observation of 
the antagonised patient on the ward is mandatory for 1.5-2 h, even if at first 
sight the antagonization seemed successful and the patient fully awake and 
cooperative. In anaesthesia, indications to administer flumazenil are adverse 
drug reactions and prolonged recovery after adequate benzodiazepine dosage. In 
intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of 
benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of 
unknown origin. Additionally, the antagonist may be administered to interrupt 
benzodiazepine sedation e.g. for neurological examination."
2903661,"The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a syndrome with lissencephaly, distinctive 
craniofacial features, growth impairment, and profound developmental failure, 
has been associated with a deletion of the distal part of chromosome band 17p13. 
A minority of patients with the syndrome do not have a deletion detectable with 
current cytogenetic techniques. Using three highly polymorphic DNA probes 
(pYNZ22, pYNH37.3, and p144D6) we have detected microdeletions in three MDS 
patients, two of whom had no visible abnormalities of chromosome 17. Loci 
defined by two of the DNA probes, pYNZ22 and pYNH37.3, were deleted in all three 
patients. The most distal locus, defined by p144D6, was present in one MDS 
patient, possibly defining the distal limits of the MDS region in band 17p13.3. 
None of these loci were absent in one case of lissencephaly without MDS."
2904118,"We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course and response to treatment of 67 
patients with tardive dystonia. The age at onset ranged from 13 to 72 years 
without predilection to any particular age group or sex. Patients developed 
tardive dystonia even after relatively short duration of exposure to dopamine 
antagonists (21% within one year). Five of 42 patients withdrawn from these 
drugs remitted. Overall clinical improvement occurred in 52% of patients. 
Tetrabenazine and reserpine were most effective (greater than 50% response rate) 
in controlling dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs diminished dystonia in 46% of 
patients."
2906043,"An essentially full-length cDNA clone for the human enzyme monoamine oxidase 
type A (MAO-A) has been used to determine the chromosomal location of a gene 
encoding it. This enzyme is important in the degradative metabolism of biogenic 
amines throughout the body and is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of 
many cell types. Southern blot analysis of PstI-digested human DNA revealed 
multiple fragments that hybridized to this probe. Using rodent-human somatic 
cell hybrids containing all or part of the human X chromosome, we have mapped 
these fragments to the region Xp21-p11. A restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) for this MAOA gene was identified and used to evaluate 
linkage distances between this locus and several other loci on Xp. The MAOA 
locus lies between DXS14 and OTC, about 29 cM from the former."

Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni."
2909100,"In a review of the records of 3,712 drug abusers, 13 patients were identified 
with neurologic deficits attributable to the use of cocaine. Ischemic 
manifestations were the most frequent, occurring in seven (54%) patients, with a 
mean age of 34.2 years. Three (23%) patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
three (23%) had intracerebral hemorrhage. Three patients from other institutions 
were included in the analysis, for a total of 16 patients, (eight with cerebral 
ischemia, four with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and four with intracerebral 
hemorrhage). Of the six patients with head computed tomographic findings of 
cerebral infarction, five had subcortical infarcts. Two of the four patients who 
presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage had a congenital intracranial aneurysm. 
One of the four patients with an intracerebral hemorrhage had an underlying 
arteriovenous malformation. The mechanism through which these complications 
occur is not completely understood. Factors that may play a role include the 
acute hypertensive response that occurs with cocaine use as well as disordered 
neurovascular control."
2912069,"The human X-linked gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is 
highly polymorphic; more than 300 G6PD variants have been identified. G6PD 
deficiency in different geographical areas appears to have arisen through 
independent mutational events, but within the same population it may also be 
heterogeneous. One example is the island of Sardinia, where careful clinical and 
biochemical studies have identified four different G6PD variants. We cloned and 
sequenced the four G6PD variants from Sardinia and found that only two mutations 
are responsible for G6PD deficiency in this area: one mutation is the cause of 
the G6PD Seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of G6PD deficiency; the other 
mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe G6PD deficiency in Sardinia 
and, possibly, in the Mediterranean."
2915017,"CDC group DF-2 is the vernacular name given to a slow-growing gram-negative 
bacterium that causes septicemia and meningitis in humans. Infections frequently 
(one-third of cases) occur following dog bites or close contact with dogs or 
occasionally with cats. Splenectomy and alcoholism appear to be strong 
predisposing factors for DF-2 infection. In addition to 150 DF-2 strains 
received for identification, we received 9 DF-2-like strains; 6 were isolated 
from wound or eye infections, 3 of which were associated with dog bites and 1 of 
which was associated with a cat scratch, and 3 were isolated from dog mouths. 
The major characteristics of DF-2 include production of acid but no gas from 
lactose and maltose and usually D-glucose; positive reactions for oxidase, 
catalase, arginine dihydrolase, gliding motility, and 
o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside; growth enhanced by serum and by 
incubation in a candle jar atmosphere; and negative reactions for sucrose, 
raffinose, inulin, melibiose, nitrate reduction, indole, and growth on MacConkey 
agar. DF-2-like strains had the same characteristics, except that acid was 
formed from sucrose, raffinose, inulin, and melibiose. By the hydroxyapatite 
method, DNAs from 12 DF-2 strains were 88% related in 60 degrees C reactions and 
84% related in 75 degrees C reactions. Related sequences contained 0.5 to 1.5% 
unpaired bases (divergence). Three DF-2-like strains were 73 to 80% related at 
60 degrees C (with 2.0 to 2.5% divergence) and 68 to 75% related at 75 degrees 
C. The relatedness of DF-2 and DF-2-like strains was 19 to 31% at 60 degrees 
Celsius and 13 to 19% at 75 degrees Celsius. The relatedness of DF-2 and 
DF-2-like strains to Capnocytophaga species was 4 to 7%. The DNA relatedness 
date indicate that eh DF-2 and the DF-2-like strains are separate, previously 
undescribed species. Both groups are phenotypically and genetically distinct 
from Capnocytophaga species, although they do share several characteristics with 
Capnocytophaga species, including cellular morphology, gliding motility, 
cellular fatty acid composition, enhancement of growth in a candle jar 
atmosphere, and G+C content. The new species differ from Capnocytophaga species 
by their positive oxidase and catalase reactions. We chose to avoid creating a 
new genus and proposed the names Capnocytophaga canimorsus sp. nov. for group 
DF-2 and C. cynodegmi sp. nov. for the DF-2-like strains."
2923442,"Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) increases the risk of major 
congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. 
However, there have been no epidemiologic reports to date on the effect of a 
subsequent pregnancy after discontinuation of isotretinoin. This article 
describes our analysis of pregnancy case reports from patients in whom 
conception occurred after isotretinoin treatment had been discontinued. Based on 
the 88 prospectively ascertained cases, the incidence rate of both spontaneous 
and missed abortions from all pregnancies was 9.1% (eight patients), and the 
incidence rate of congenital malformation among the live births was 5.0% (four 
patients). The incidence rates for both these outcomes were not significantly 
different from the rates reported for women of reproductive age in the general 
population. In addition, the malformations reported were not characteristic of 
retinoic acid-induced congenital anomalies."
2929356,"Seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome were examined with a 
view to finding symptoms of autism. Some 40% of the group showed all or many of 
the symptoms typical of autistic disorder. The high frequency of autistic 
symptoms in Moebius syndrome might be a marked overrepresentation and could be 
suggestive of a common underlying neurobiological deficit at the brainstem 
level."
2932368,"The diversity of hereditary pathology in 5 regions of Kostroma district was

7 X-linked recessive disorders were found. The most frequent autosomal dominant 
disorders were: neurofibromatosis, pigmentary degeneration of retina, 
hypochondroplasia, ichtiosis, idiopathic scoliosis. The most frequent among the 
autosomal recessive disorders were: oligophrenia, pigmentary degeneration of 
retina, muscular atrophy of juvenile Kugelberg--Welander type, congenital 
cataract. The most frequent X-linked disorders were: muscular Duchenne type

2933494,"Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus infection of the finger. It may be 
caused by either herpes simplex type 1 or 2. It is characterized by pain, 
erythema, and nonpurulent vesicle or bullae formation. It may be due to a 
primary or recurrent infection. It is a common infection in health care 
professionals who have frequent contact with the secretions of patients' mouths 
and respiratory tracts. The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow may be confirmed by 
Tzanck test, acute and convalescent herpes simplex antibody titers, viral 
culture, and fluorescent antibody tests. The infection is self-limited, and 
surgical intervention generally should be avoided. Techniques for prevention and 
control of the infection include appropriate isolation of patients with herpes 
infections, avoidance of patient care by health care personnel with active 
infections, and the use of gloves when handling secretions."
2934121,"Diabetes results in myocardial functional alterations which are accompanied by a 
depression of biochemical parameters such as myosin ATPase and calcium uptake in 
the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Methyl palmoxirate, a fatty acid analog, is reported 
to decrease circulating glucose levels by inhibiting fatty acid metabolism, thus 
forcing carbohydrate utilization. In the present study, we attempted to prevent 
streptozotocin diabetes-induced myocardial alterations in the rat. Using the 
isolated working heart preparation, we observed a depression of myocardial 
function in rats 6 weeks after the induction of diabetes, which was 
characterized by the inability of these hearts to develop left ventricular 
pressures and rates of ventricular contraction and relaxation as well as control 
hearts at higher left atrial filling pressures. Methyl palmoxirate treatment (25 
mg kg-1 day-1 po daily) was unable to control diabetes-induced changes in plasma 
glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and total lipids. Also, the functional 
depression seen in diabetic rat hearts was present despite the treatment. 
However, depression of calcium uptake and elevation of long chain acyl 
carnitines seen in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) prepared from diabetic rat hearts 
could be prevented by the treatment. As triiodothyronine (T3) treatment has been 
shown to normalize depression of cardiac myosin ATPase in diabetic rats, we 
repeated the study using a combination of T3 (30 micrograms kg-1 day-1 sc daily) 
and methyl palmoxirate. While diabetic rats treated with T3 alone did not show 
significant improvement of myocardial function when compared with untreated 
diabetics, the function of those treated with both T3 and methyl palmoxirate was 
not significantly different from that in control rat hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 
AT 250 WORDS)"
2936238,"Chronic heart failure results from two processes, i.e., myocardial and 
congestive failure. Myocardial failure is clinically silent, most often 
progresses slowly, and is documented by a depressed left ventricular ejection 
fraction. Multiple etiologic factors include systolic and diastolic overloads, 
myocardial necrosis and/or ischemia, and, perhaps, microvascular spasm. 
Myocardial failure ultimately leads to exaggerated neurohumoral compensatory 
mechanisms and derangements of the peripheral circulation, which are the 
hallmarks of congestive heart failure. At that stage of the syndrome, patients 
have symptoms, initially, with exercise and, later, at rest. Objective 
assessment of severity is afforded by determination of maximal oxygen uptake 
during maximal exercise testing. When congestive heart failure supervenes, the 
prognosis is poor. Current medical therapy is aimed at improving the 
derangements of the peripheral circulation, which relieves the symptoms but 
leaves the primary myocardial process unaffected. The goal of future therapy is 
to intervene at an earlier stage of the syndrome to halt or even partially 
reverse the myocardial failure."
2943896,"Seventy-nine cases of ovarian endometrioma were treated via the laparoscope. The 
surgical technique gradually evolved from drainage alone to fulguration and 
finally to excision of the endometrioma cyst wall. Indications for laparoscopy 
were infertility (35 cases), pain (33), hypermenorrhea (5) and pelvic mass (4); 
the condition was an incidental finding in 2 cases. There were no intraoperative 
or postoperative complications. The long-term results, especially the fertility 
outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy 
following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone. Of the eight women with 
endometriomas who did not conceive, six had well-documented male factor 
infertility."
2949585,"The safety and antihypertensive efficacy of PN 200-110 (isradipine), a novel 
calcium antagonist, are discussed in a preliminary report of double-blind, 
multicenter, controlled, phase III clinical trials for essential hypertension. 
Patients who qualified for entry after a 3 week placebo-washout period were 
enrolled in 1 of 5 studies; 2 studies were placebo controlled; 3 studies 
evaluated PN 200-110 against 1 of 3 active controls: hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 
propranolol or prazosin. A separate study assessing the effects of PN 200-110 in 
combination with HCTZ versus propranolol plus HCTZ is also discussed. Compared 
with placebo, PN 200-110 decreased mean supine systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures by 20/16 mm Hg versus 4/6 mm Hg. Compared with placebo and active 
control drugs, PN 200-110 normalized supine diastolic blood pressure to less 
than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 72% of patients, versus 13% in the placebo group, 
74% in the HCTZ group, 45% in the propranolol group and 69% in the prazosin 
group. In the ability to decrease diastolic blood pressure by greater than or 
equal to 10 mm Hg, PN 200-110 compared favorably to prazosin (81% vs 81%), and 
was superior to HCTZ (81% vs 61%) and propranolol (81% vs 36%). In combination 
with HCTZ, PN 200-110 exerted as great an antihypertensive effect as propranolol 
plus HCTZ. Long-term therapy with PN 200-110 was also effective. Supine systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures decreased a mean of 15/13 mm Hg at 3 months, and 
18/20 mm Hg at 12 months. PN 200-110 is well tolerated with relatively few 
adverse effects reported."
2949917,"The effect of hypotensive therapy on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin 
(TERalb) was studied in eight hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients 
(mean age 29, range 19-42 years) with nephropathy and retinopathy. 
Transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously 
injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin), urinary albumin excretion rate 
(radial immunodiffusion), and glomerular filtrate rate (single bolus 51-Cr-EDTA 
technique) were measured. After hypotensive treatment (mean duration, 23 months, 
range 7-39 months) with combinations of metoprolol, hydralazine, and frusemide 
or thiazide diuretics, arterial blood pressure fell from 152/103 +/- 18/6 mmHg 
(mean +/- SD) to 133/81 +/- 12/10 mmHg (p less than 0.01), transcapillary escape 
rate of albumin from 10.2 +/- 1.8 to 8.1 +/- 1.8% of intravascular mass of 
albumin/h (p less than 0.01), albuminuria from 1803 (370-5066) micrograms/min to 
940 (101-2676) micrograms/min (median and range, p less than 0.05), and 
glomerular filtration rate from 103 +/- 23 to 84 +/- 22 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less 
than 0.01). Our study suggests that effective hypotensive treatment reduces the 
abnormally elevated albumin leakage characteristically found in 
insulin-dependent diabetic patients with clinical microangiopathy. This may be 
due to a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure in the microcirculation."
2951101,"Three patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are described in whom 
generalized oedema and weight gain followed the administration of excessive 
monocomponent insulins, in two cases associated with symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Serial measurements of plasma volume and transcapillary escape rate of albumin 
(TERA) using 125I-labelled albumin, serum colloid osmotic pressure (COP) using a 
membrane colloid osmometer, packed cell volume (PCV), and serum proteins, showed 
that oedema was associated with an increased plasma volume and TERA, while serum 
albumin and total protein concentration and serum COP were reduced. A reduction 
in daily insulin dose abolished hypoglycaemia and resulted in weight loss, 
natriuresis, diuresis, a reduction in plasma volume and TERA, and an increase in 
serum albumin, total protein, and COP. Strict metabolic control in previously 
poorly controlled patients may cause insulin-induced increments in plasma volume 
and albumin escape rate."
2952859,"Endogenous alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in plasma is elevated in 
various hypervolaemic conditions. Possible relationships between circulating 
immunoreactive ANP and cardiovascular and splanchnic haemodynamics were 
therefore studied in patients with cirrhosis (n = 16) and controls (n = 12). 
Arterial plasma concentration of ANP in supine patients was (mean +/- SEM) 33 
+/- 4 vs 41 +/- 10 pg/ml (9.9 +/- 1.2 vs 12.3 +/- 3.0 fmol/l) in controls 
(n.s.), and there was a weak direct correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 
0.36, P = 0.05). There was no relationship with the presence of ascites or 
diuretic treatment. Central blood volume (CBV, i.e. the blood volume in the 
heart cavities, lungs, and aorta), determined from the mean transit time of 
125I-labelled of 125I-labelled albumin and cardiac output, was significantly 
reduced in cirrhotics compared to controls (1.45 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.10 l, P 
less than 0.02) and inversely correlated with portal pressure (r = 0.42, P less 
than 0.05), whereas total plasma volume was somewhat increased (3.51 +/- 0.2 vs. 
3.19 +/- 0.2, 0.05 less than P less than 0.1). A high arterio-venous extraction 
of ANP was found in the splanchnic system (extraction ratio 0.44 vs 0.28), 
kidney (0.45 vs 0.54), lower limb (0.53 vs 0.40), and forearm (0.27 vs 0.18) in 
patients and controls, respectively (n.s.). Our results suggest that the lack of 
elevation of circulating ANP in cirrhosis, even in the presence of actual fluid 
retention, may be explained by central hypovolaemia in these patients. Turnover 
and degradation of ANP is rapid and normal, as evaluated from the tissue 
extraction ratios."
2955886,"The association of Down's syndrome and leukemia has been documented for over 50 
years. Multiple studies have established the incidence of leukemia in Down's 
syndrome patients to be 10- to 20-fold higher than that in the general 
population. The age of onset for leukemia in these children is bimodal, peaking 
first in the newborn period and again at 3-6 years. This increased risk extends 
into adulthood. All cytogenetic types of Down's syndrome apparently predispose 
to leukemia. The proportion of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute 
nonlymphoblastic leukemia in patients with Down's syndrome is similar to 
non-Down's syndrome leukemia patients matched for age. There are case reports in 
which leukemia, Down's syndrome, and other chromosomal aberrations cluster 
within a family. In these kindreds, there may be a familial tendency toward 
nondisjunction. Congenital leukemia also occurs with increased frequency in 
Down's syndrome patients, and is characterized by a preponderance of acute 
nonlymphoblastic leukemia (similar to non-Down's syndrome patients). Transient 
leukemoid reactions have been observed in Down's syndrome patients, as well as 
in phenotypically normal children with constitutional trisomy 21 mosaicism. The 
transient leukemoid reactions are characterized by a high spontaneous remission 
rate. However, in some Downs syndrome patients with apparent transient leukemoid 
reaction, leukemia relapse following periods of spontaneous remission have been 
reported. Cytogenetic studies of leukemic cells in Down's syndrome patients show 
a tendency toward hyperdiploidy. Besides trisomy 21, there is no other specific 
cytogenetic abnormality that is characteristic of the leukemia cells in Down's 
syndrome patients. The possible mechanisms for leukemogenesis in Down's syndrome 
patients may involve factors at the levels of the organism, the organ/system, 
the cell, the chromosomes or the DNA."
2956451,"Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin (AVP), 
renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PA), catecholamines and urinary 
prostaglandins (PG), as well as renal function were measured in children in the 
edematous state of the nephrotic syndrome before and after infusion of human 
serum albumin. Before albumin infusion, plasma levels of AVP, PRA, PA and 
noradrenaline (NA) and urinary excretion of PGE2, PGE-Met, PGF2 alpha were 
elevated. The mean value of plasma ANP was in the normal range. Albumin infusion 
produced a 36% increase in the calculated plasma volume. It was associated with 
a fivefold rise in the plasma level of ANP (31.6 +/- 22.6 vs. 151.4 +/- 52 
fmol/ml mean, SD), and a significant fall in the levels of PRA, AVP, PA, and NA. 
Similarly, urinary concentration of PGE2, PGE-Met and PGF2 alpha fell. Urine 
flow, GFR, UNaV, FENa, and COsm increased significantly, while CH2O remained 
unchanged. The diuresis, natriuresis and GFR correlated with the level of plasma 
ANP, while urinary sodium excretion did not correlate with PA or NA levels. 
These findings suggest that ANP plays an important role in albumin induced 
natriuresis in children with nephrotic syndrome."
2958207,"1. Plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary sodium 
excretion were measured in six normal male subjects before, during and for 195 
min after a 60 min infusion of 2 litres of saline (0.9% NaCl, 308 mmol of Na+). 
2. During the saline infusion, there was a significant increase in plasma ANP 
and urinary sodium excretion and a significant decrease in plasma renin 
activity, aldosterone, albumin, creatinine and packed cell volume. 3. The 
maximal rise in mean plasma ANP occurred 15 min after stopping the infusion and 
the maximal rise in mean urinary sodium excretion in the collection period 30 
min later. 4. Plasma ANP then decreased so that by the end of the study the 
level was the same as before the saline infusion. However, at this time, 195 min 
after the saline infusion was stopped, there was still a net positive sodium 
balance of 220 mmol and urinary sodium excretion remained significantly 
elevated. 5. Our results are compatible with the concept that increased ANP 
secretion may play a role in the immediate increase in sodium excretion after a 
saline load. However, they also suggest that other mechanisms may be more 
important for the longer term increase in sodium excretion."
2967444,"Tay-Sachs disease displays a variety of forms on the clinical and biochemical 
level. On the molecular level it has been shown, that poly (A)+ RNA preparations 
from fibroblasts of patients with classical Tay-Sachs disease lack detectable 
alpha-chain message when analyzed by Northern blotting with complementary DNA 
encoding the alpha-chain of human beta-hexosaminidase A. In this report the p 
beta H alpha-5 clone was used to investigate whether patients with two different 
variants of Tay-Sachs disease also lack the alpha-chain message. On the basis of 
RNA hybridization analyses, we could show that our patients which synthesize an 
altered alpha-chain, as judged by testing enzyme activity and substrate 
specificity, have the 2.1 kb mRNA which is also seen in healthy control 
patients."
2968500,"The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, 
which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA 
polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation 
activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene. The E1a 
transforming functions more closely correlate with the repressor property than 
with transactivation in that both E1a proteins express the repressor and 
transformation functions while only the 289-amino-acid protein is an efficient 
transactivator. To understand whether the transcriptional regulatory activities 
of E1a are related to its ras cooperation activity, we generated a series of 
mutant E1a expression vectors by linker insertion mutagenesis of the 
289-amino-acid protein. Here we describe a new class of mutants which although 
defective for enhancer repression still can cooperate with the ras oncogene in 
cell transformation. The mutants are also defective in transcription 
transactivation. Our data suggest that enhancer repression and transformation 
via ras cooperation are separate E1a functions and that cooperation with ras 
does not rely on either of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory 
functions of E1a. We also show that mutations which inactivate enhancer 
repression are not confirmed to a single critical domain necessary for 
repression. We therefore propose that the integrity of the overall configuration 
of the E1a proteins is important for the repression activity."
2970919,"Lower limb venous compliance and transcapillary escape rate of transferrin were 
measured in eight normotensive, insulin-dependent male diabetic patients and 
eight control subjects using a dual isotope technique. Technetium-99m labelled 
autologous erythrocytes were used to measure venous compliance and to correct 
for local changes in blood volume, whilst Indium-113m labelled transferrin was 
used to measure transcapillary escape of protein. The diabetic patients were 
found to have reduced venous compliance 1.5 (0.7 to 3.4) x 10(-2) mmHg-1 
compared with controls 3.2 (2.4 to 4.1) x 10(-2) mmHg-1 (p less than 0.01). The 
diabetic patients were also found to have greater transcapillary escape of 
transferrin -2.7 (-1.5 to -5.3) x 10(-3), compared with control subjects -5.2 
(-4.1 to -8.1) x 10(-3) (p less than 0.02) in response to increasing hydrostatic 
pressure. These results show reduced venous compliance in patients with a mean 
duration of diabetes of 15 years and with only at most, early complications of 
diabetes, and confirm previous observations showing increased transcapillary 
escape of protein."

developed respiratory failure several hours after verapamil was given. 
Improvement in respiratory function did not occur when guanidine was given, but 
was delayed until verapamil was discontinued 3 days later. Although other 
factors may have contributed to the clinical deterioration of our patient, the 
temporal relationship to verapamil and the theoretical danger of calcium channel 
blockade lead us to believe that the drug should be used cautiously in LES."
3018425,"The typical patient with post-traumatic hypopituitarism is a young adult male 
presenting months to years after an automobile accident, following which he was 
unconscious for several days. He will probably have sustained a fracture of the 
base of the skull and on recovery is likely to have permanent visual or other 
neurological sequelae. Temporary or permanent diabetes insipidus may have 
occurred. The features of panhypopituitarism such as weight loss, fatigue, 
faintness, loss of libido, and impotence may have been ascribed to depression or 
the ""postconcussion syndrome"" and often inappropriate treatment and 
rehabilitation advised. The striking feature on review of the literature is that 
the pathological consequences of head injury to the pituitary and hypothalamus 
have been well described, while only 47 cases of traumatic hypopituitarism have 
been reported. The most likely reason for this disparity is that head injury of 
sufficient severity to cause hypothalamic and pituitary damage commonly led to 
death. More patients now survive, owing to the availability of intensive care; 
accordingly, most cases have been reported in the last 15 years. However, 
several patients are described in whom the initiating head injury was not 
associated with a skull fracture or followed by coma. We recommend that patients 
with major head injury (defined by post-traumatic amnesia greater than 24 
hours), and in particular those with fractures of the base of the skull or 
diabetes insipidus should be closely monitored for symptoms and signs of 
endocrine dysfunction and appropriate dynamic pituitary-function tests 
performed."
3019250,"It is well known that the biological behavior of lung cancer varies according to 
histological type and growth pattern. Therefore, more precise analysis of 
various morphologic features affecting prognosis are needed based on tumor 
histology. Lung cancer is mainly classified into 4 major histological types; 
squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell 
carcinoma. Recently lung cancer has been subclassified into small cell carcinoma 
and non-small cell carcinoma on the basis of responsiveness to chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy. In small cell carcinoma, combination of chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy is the main modality for treatment, and the most important 
prognostic factor is LD and ED stage classification. Even so, a new histological 
classification is proposed according to the responsiveness to chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy. On the other hand, surgical therapy is the first choice for 
the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and the most important prognostic 
factor is TNM and related stage classification. In squamous cell carcinoma, 
moreover, extended resection is sometimes tried because of its local 
invasiveness. Early lung cancer of hilar type is mostly squamous cell carcinoma 
and highly curative by resection. The biological behavior of adenocarcinoma is 
the most variable among lung cancers. In the histopathological study of 
surgically resected cases, moreover, histological differentiation, nuclear 
atypia of tumor cells, mitotic frequency, grades of scarring associated with a 
tumor, and degrees of infiltration of T-zone histiocytes is closely related to 
prognosis. Scoring of these factors may help a clinician to reach a decision on 
the necessity and type of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in 
cases of Stage I adenocarcinoma. Most cases of large cell carcinoma including 
giant cell carcinoma ultrastructurally reveal features of differentiation toward 
adenocarcinoma and/or squamous cell carcinoma. Giant cell carcinoma shows the 
most unfavorable prognosis because of its rapid growth. However, among operable 
cases of giant cell carcinoma, some long-term survivors do exist. Evaluating 
these forms of biological behavior according to tumor histology at the time of 
treatment, it is easier to decide whether or not adjuvant therapy is necessary."
3020860,"Psammoma bodies in meningocytic whorls were investigated by electron microscopy. 
In some whorls, connective tissue fibers were seen and membrane-bound vesicles 
were contiguous to degenerated cells. Some small vesicles, 0.1 to 0.5 micron in 
diameter, were outlined by plasma membrane (matrix vesicles), other larger ones, 
about 1 to several micron in diameter, were invested by a thick wall (matrix 
giant bodies). Mineralized deposits were frequent in these vesicles and 
occasionally large masses of mineralized connective tissue fibers (psammoma 
bodies) were seen. Analysis of the material in the mineralized vesicles and 
fibers, using an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer, showed that both calcium 
and phosphorous were evident and hydroxyapatite was substantiated using an X-ray 
diffractometer. Psammoma body formation in the meningocytic whorls may represent 
degeneration in some whorls of the central cells which contain connective tissue 
fibers, producing cell debris such as membrane invested vesicles. Subsequently, 
calcification occurs in these vesicles, and the mineralization process extends 
to neighboring connective tissue fibers. The calcified mass forms a psammoma 
body."
3023620,"The structure of replicating simian virus 40 (SV40) minichromosomes was studied 
by DNA crosslinking with trimethyl-psoralen. The procedure was used both in 
vitro with extracted SV40 minichromosomes as well as in vivo with SV40-infected 
cells. Both procedures gave essentially the same results. Mature SV40 
minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), 
except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to 
contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2). In replicative intermediates, nucleosomes 
are present in the unreplicated parental stem with the replication fork possibly 
penetrating into the nucleosomal DNA before the histone octamer is removed. 
Nucleosomes reassociate on the newly replicated DNA branches at distances from 
the branch point of 225 ( +/- 145) nucleotides on the leading strand and of 285( 
+/- 120) nucleotides on the lagging strand. In the presence of cycloheximide, 
daughter duplexes contained unequal numbers of nucleosomes, supporting 
dispersive and random segregation of parental nucleosomes. These were arranged 
in clusters with normal nucleosome spacing. We detected a novel type of 
interlocked dimer comprising two fully replicated molecules connected by a 
single-stranded DNA bridge. We cannot decide whether these dimers represent 
hemicatenanes or whether the two circles are joined by a Holliday-type 
structure. The joining site maps within the replication terminus. We propose 
that these dimers represent molecules engaged in strand segregation."
3023854,"In eucaryotes the 5'-terminal guanylate moiety of mature tRNAHis is added 
posttranscriptionally. To determine whether the same mechanism occurs in 
procaryotes, we processed in vitro-derived Escherichia coli tRNAHis precursors 
to mature tRNA, either in E. coli extracts or by using pure M1-RNA, the 
catalytic component of RNase P. The results show that the extra guanylate at the 
5' end of mature E. coli tRNAHis is encoded in the gene and is found in tRNA as 
the result of an unusual cleavage by RNase P."
3025706,"The restriction endonuclease EcoRI dependent recombination of compatible 
plasmids has been studied in RecA cells of Escherichia coli. Plasmid RP4 and the 
isogenic ColE1 type plasmids pSA14 or pSA25, differing in 
restriction-modification RM EcoRI genes, have been used to study this type of 
recombination. EcoRI dependent recombination of plasmids is demonstrated in RecA 
cells and, thus, is independent of general system of homologous recombination. 
The classes of recombinant plasmids isolated from RecA cells differ from the 
classes isolated from wild type cells. Levels of tetracycline resistance 
conferred by plasmid RP4 are shown to be dependent on the alleles of RecA+ gene, 
being extremely low in RecA cells. This property is demonstrated to be useful 
for obtaining the multicopy recombinant plasmids resulting from EcoRI dependent 
recombination in RecA cells of Escherichia coli."
3029112,"We previously have mapped N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sites within the genomic RNA 
of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). The results of that study and of experiments using 
inhibitors of methylation suggest that m6A might be involved in mRNA processing 
events. We describe an approach for directly analyzing the function of m6A in 
RNA and for studying the sequence specificity of the m6A methylase. Two sites of 
methylation in RSV (nucleotides 7414 and 7424) were altered by 
oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The highly conserved GAC consensus 
sequence at those sites was changed to GAU. The new sequences were no longer 
methylated in the RSV genomic RNA; the GAC sequence was required for efficient 
base modification at those two adenosines. The altered m6A pattern did not 
affect viral RNA processing or the viral life cycle within infected cells."
3029137,"Human neutrophils exposed to 10(-4) M doxorubicin and the derivatives epirubicin 
and thepirubicin revealed a different intracellular penetration and distribution 
pattern as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetric 
determination of drug intracellular concentration. While doxorubicin was found 
to be a potent inducer of superoxide generation from resting cells, epirubicin 
exhibited less superoxide-inducing power. Thepirubicin on the contrary did not 
show any superoxide-inducing effect. Moreover the anthracyclines tested all 
inhibited the phorbol ester-stimulated chemiluminescent response to the same 
extent, which suggested a common target for the drug action. 
Anthracycline-stimulated superoxide production seems to correlate with the 
cardiotoxic effects. The most cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin, is the most potent 
inducer of superoxide generation, while epirubicin, which is less cardiotoxic, 
has a relatively limited effect on superoxide production. Thepirubicin which has 
been shown not to induce delayed cardiomyopathy has no effect on superoxide 
release from the cells."
3029559,"During the course of their recirculation through the body, blood-borne 
lymphocytes specifically adhere to high endothelial venules (HEV) within 
secondary lymphoid organs such as peripheral lymph nodes (PN) and gut-associated 
Peyer's patches (PP). This adherence event, which initiates the extravasation of 
the lymphocyte, is highly specific in terms of the class of lymphocyte and the 
anatomic location of the HEV. We review evidence that the lymphocyte adhesive 
molecule ('homing receptor') involved in attachment to PN HEV is a 
carbohydrate-binding receptor (lectin-like) with specificity for 
mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-like ligands. We describe the use of a novel 
cytochemical probe for the detection and characterization of cell surface 
carbohydrate-binding receptors. Using a M6P-based probe, we show that the 
carbohydrate-binding receptor on lymphocytes is closely-related or identical to 
the MEL-14 antigen, a putative homing receptor identified by a monoclonal 
antibody. Evidence is presented that the lymphocyte attachment sites on both PN 
and PP HEV are inactivated by mild periodate oxidation and hence are probably 
carbohydrate in nature. Yet, the sites are biochemically distinguishable in that 
one class (PN) requires sialidase-sensitive structures whereas the other (PP) 
does not. We raise the possibility that diversity in the carbohydrate-based 
recognition determinants on HEV may underlie the adhesive specificities in this 
system."
3031599,"We have cloned and sequenced a 977bp DNA fragment, pXTU6-2, that represents the 
transcription unit for a Xenopus tropicalis U6 RNA gene. This basic repeating 
unit is reiterated ca.500-fold per haploid genome. Oocyte injections of pXTU6-2 
led to the transcription of a mature-sized U6 RNA that, however, lacked internal 
2'-O-methylations. These posttranscriptional modifications of U6 RNA might be 
cytoplasmic and could require its association with U4 RNA to be accomplished. 
The low alpha- amanitin sensitivity of U6 RNA synthesis in oocytes suggested 
that U6 RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, consistent with features of 
the U6 RNA molecule which also contains a Box A- like intragenic control region. 
Inspection of X. tropicalis, mouse and human U6 DNA upstream sequences revealed 
the presence of a TATA box as well as of the proximal and enhancer (octamer 
motif) elements contained in snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. We 
propose that U6 RNAs are synthesized by a specialized transcription complex 
consisting of RNA polymerase III and transcription factors, some of which are 
very likely shared with RNA polymerase II promoters."
3032534,"The authors analyzed a family in which three descendants presented with 
adenocarcinoma of the colon. In two of them the presence of colonic adenomatosis 
was observed. Another family member, a 13-year-old girl, presented with Turcot 
syndrome, that is, brain tumor associated with colonic adenomatosis. The nature 
of the hereditary transmission of Turcot syndrome is hence analyzed, discussing 
whether it happens through an autosomal recessive or a dominant gene. 
Undoubtedly the family has colonic adenomatosis, a disease considered of 
autosomal dominant transmission. Based on the clinical observation, the authors 
suggest that Turcot syndrome may be determined by an autosomal gene with a 
pleiotropic effect and variable expressivity."
3035513,"The binding of [3H] [3-MeHis2] thyrotropin releasing hormone [( 3H]MeTRH) to 
brain membranes prepared from 8 week old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and 
normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was determined. [3H]MeTRH bound 
specifically to rat brain membranes at a single high affinity site. The density 
(Bmax value) of [3H]MeTRH binding sites was significantly greater (28%) in SHR 
rats compared to WKY rats. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd values) for 
the binding of [3H]MeTRH in SHR and WKY rats did not differ. Binding in the 
various brain regions revealed that the density of [3H]MeTRH was highest in the 
hypothalamus followed in decreasing order by pons + medulla, midbrain, cortex 
and striatum. The binding of [3H]MeTRH was approximately 25% greater in cortex, 
hypothalamus and striatum of SHR rats in comparison to WKY rats. The binding in 
pons + medulla, midbrain and pituitary of SHR and WKY rats did not differ. To 
assess the significance of increased binding sites for [3H]MeTRH in some brain 
regions of SHR rats, the binding studies were carried out during normotensive 
and hypertensive stages of postnatal age in the two strains. In 3 and 4 week old 
SHR rats there was neither an increase in blood pressure nor any increase in 
[3H]MeTRH binding in the hypothalamus and striatum as compared to age matched 
WKY rats. With the development of elevated blood pressure at 6 weeks, an 
increase in [3H]MeTRH binding in the hypothalamus and striatum of SHR rats in 
comparison to the tissues from WKY rats was observed. The results provide, for 
the first time, evidence for a parallel increase in the density of brain TRH 
receptors with elevation of blood pressure, and suggest that brain TRH receptors 
may play an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension."
3036686,"A patient with the phenotype of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) was found to have a 
normal karyotype in blood lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Assessment of the 
chromosome 21 markers SOD1, CBS, ETS2, D21S11, and BCEI showed partial trisomy 
by duplication of a chromosome segment carrying the SOD1, CBS, and ETS2 loci and 
flanked by the BCEI and D21S11 loci, which are not duplicated. This 
submicroscopic duplication at the interface of 21q21 and 21q22.1 reduces to 
about 2000-3000 kb the critical segment the trisomy of which is responsible for 
the phenotype of trisomy 21."
3037325,"Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and 
polyadenylation of the newly formed end. Cleavage of simian virus 40 late 
pre-mRNA in a crude nuclear extract generated two RNAs, 5' and 3' 
half-molecules. These RNAs were unmodified and linear. The 5' half-molecule 
contained sequences upstream but not downstream of the poly(A) site and ended in 
a 3'-terminal hydroxyl. The 3' half-molecules comprised a family of RNAs, each 
of which contains only sequences downstream of the poly(A) site, and ends in a 
5'-terminal phosphate. These RNAs differed only in the locations of their 5' 
terminus. The 3' terminus of the 5' half-molecule was the adenosine 10 
nucleotides downstream of AAUAAA, at the +1 position. The 5' terminus of the 
longest 3' half-molecule was at +2. Thus, these two RNAs contain every 
nucleoside and phosphate of the precursor. The existence of these half-molecules 
demonstrates that endonucleolytic cleavage occurs near the poly(A) site. 5' 
half-molecules generated in the presence of EDTA (which blocks polyadenylation, 
but not cleavage) ended at the adenosine at position +1 of the precursor. When 
incubated in the extract under suitable conditions, they became polyadenylated. 
5' half-molecules formed in 3'-dATP-containing reactions contained a single 
3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) residue added onto the +1 adenosine and were poor 
polyadenylation substrates. We infer that the +1 adenosine of the precursor 
becomes the first A of the poly(A) tract and provides a 3' hydroxyl group to 
which poly(A) is added posttranscriptionally."
3042912,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for levodopa have been studied in 
relation to the pathogenesis of the motor fluctuations which complicate advanced 
Parkinson's disease. Since levodopa clearance from the general circulation was 
found to be similar in patients with wearing-off or on-off phenomena and those 
with a stable response to levodopa, peripheral pharmacokinetic factors are 
unlikely to be involved. Efficacy half-time for levodopa, on the other hand, was 
significantly reduced in patients with mainly wearing-off fluctuations in 
comparison to those manifesting a stable response to oral levodopa; individuals 
with predominantly on-off phenomenon had an even more extreme reduction in the 
duration of the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. Conversion from oral to 
intravenous levodopa treatment immediately stabilized plasma levodopa levels in 
both the wearing-off and on-off groups; motor variability also decreased, 
especially in those with wearing-off phenomenon. During 11 days of continuous 
intravenous levodopa therapy, additional reductions in motor fluctuations 
occurred in both groups, but at a significantly faster rate in patients with 
wearing-off than in those with on-off responses. These results suggest that 
wearing-off phenomenon may arise as a consequence of the degeneration of 
dopamine terminals due to natural disease progression with a resultant inability 
to buffer variations in levodopa availability; on-off phenomenon, may reflect 
additional postsynaptic dopamine receptor dysregulation, possibly in response to 
the resultant, nonphysiologic fluctuations in synaptic dopamine."
3043797,"Cyclosporine mediates its immunosuppressive effect by preventing the synthesis 
of lymphokine mRNA during the process of T lymphocyte activation. Although the 
detailed molecular mechanism by which CsA achieves this effect is unknown, two 
proteins have been identified as putative intracellular CsA-receptor proteins. 
One of these, calmodulin, is an important Ca++-binding protein and enzyme 
cofactor and the other, cyclophilin, is a novel protein that is reported to have 
protein kinase activity. In this study the CsA-binding capacity of both these 
proteins has been assessed using CsA-coated ELISA plates and CsA-affinity gel 
matrices. CsA binding was shown by cyclophilin whereas no CsA-calmodulin binding 
could be detected under identical conditions. However, it was not possible to 
demonstrate any cyclophilin-associated protein kinase activity. Jurkat cells 
were probed for the presence of CsA-binding proteins using the CsA-affinity gel 
matrix; a 17 KD protein, most probably cyclophilin, was identified as the major 
CsA-binding protein. In addition, a previously unidentified CsA-binding 45 KD 
phosphoprotein was precipitated from 32P-labeled Jurkat cells. These results 
would support cyclophilin as the major, if not only, intracellular receptor 
protein for CsA. However, the relationship between binding of CsA to cyclophilin 
and/or the 45 KD phosphoprotein and the immunosuppressive effects of CsA is 
still unknown."
3047212,"Pseudomelanosis duodeni, speckled black pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa, 
presents a striking appearance at endoscopy. Among the 14 reported cases there 
is a predominance of black women greater than 40 years old, but it can occur in 
any race and age group. There is no known association with pigmentation 
elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract or with the use of laxatives. However, 
most reported patients were hypertensive (many treated with hydralazine and 
propranolol) and significant numbers suffered from upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding, chronic renal failure, or diabetes mellitus. The pigment is usually 
located in mucosal macrophages, in lysosomes. Histochemical studies and electron 
probe microanalysis suggest that several pigments may result in this endoscopic 
appearance, including lipomelanin, ceroid, iron sulfide, and hemosiderin. 
Additional studies, possibly using tissue from surgical resections or autopsies, 
are needed to determine the etiology and clinical significance of this 
heterogeneous entity."
3049055,"The sphincter of Oddi is the smooth muscle connection between the bile duct and 
the duodenum. Its physiological function is associated with a regular motility 
characterized by phasic contractions superimposed on the sphincter of Oddi 
baseline pressure. Recently introduced ERCP-manometry permits further studies of 
sphincter of Oddi pharmacology. A number of drugs have so far been studied. 
Sedatives of the diazepam type had no effect on the sphincter, while 
butylscopolaminium bromide, a typical neurotropic agent, brings about cessation 
of the sphincter motility for 3-8 minutes. Hymecromon lowered the sphincter 
baseline pressure from 9.8 to 7.8 mmHg. A 1.2 mg sublingual dose of 
nitroglycerin, a typical musculotropic agent, caused significant relaxation of 
the sphincter, and decreased baseline pressure from 8.9 mmHg to 2.9 mmHg; 
Sphincter motility was not affected. Morphine-like analgetics, in particular 
pentazocine, elevated sphincter baseline pressure, but buprenorphine and 
tramadol did not. Pharmacological doses of gastrointestinal hormones also affect 
the sphincter; CCK octapeptide, glucagon and secretin are able to decrease 
sphincter of Oddi baseline pressure, and CCK octapeptide abolishes sphincter 
motility. Sphincter of Oddi pharmacology is of clinical interest. The 
administration of sphincter-relaxing agents, in particular nitroglycerin and 
butylscopolaminium bromide, enables the endoscopist to extract small common bile 
duct stones without previous papillotomy. Analgetics that induce sphincter 
contraction and thus hinder the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, may be 
helpful for the treatment of pain in patients with pancreatico-biliary disease. 
Investigations into the effect of CCK on the healthy and diseased sphincter 
permit us to identify patients with sphincter dysfunction using a special 
CCK-provocation test."
3054653,"The antenatal sonographic diagnosis of exencephaly in four gestations is 
reported. Exencephaly is an uncommon malformation of the cranium that 
characteristically involves a large, disorganized mass of cerebral tissue. The 
flat bones of the calvaria are absent, leaving the brain mass uncovered. 
Secondarily, anencephaly may develop as a result of prolonged exposure of the 
developing encephalon to amniotic fluid and trauma in utero. As in anencephaly, 
facial structures and the bony base of the calvarium are often preserved in 
exencephaly. Sonographically, the outstanding feature of exencephaly is the 
cerebral mass, with convolutions or ""pseudo"" sulcal patterns present. These 
findings correlate well with the pathologic examination and define a clinical 
entity that is incompatible with human life."
3056562,"Thirty-two female patients with clinical and urodynamic findings of genuine 
stress urinary incontinence were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery for 
stress urinary incontinence. Twenty-nine control patients had identical 
evaluations before and 6 months after surgery which did not involve the 
urethrovesical junction. Twenty-four patients with primary bladder instability 
had similar evaluations and served as a second control group. Anatomical 
landmarks indicating support to the urethrovesical junction were evaluated by 
the position of the urethra at the most dependent point in the bladder on 
straining and the urethral descent on straining to beneath the posterior ramus 
of the symphysis pubis on bead chain cystography. The urethrovesical junction 
drop on straining was evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography. Cystographic and 
ultrasonographic tests for the position of the urethrovesical junction at the 
most dependent position in the bladder during straining were very sensitive in 
women with stress urinary incontinence (94 and 87% respectively) but much less 
specific (45 and 48% respectively). When evaluating anatomical support to the 
urethrovesical junction and its descent on straining, these tests were both 
highly sensitive (97 and 94% respectively) and specific (76 and 96% 
respectively) in women with genuine stress urinary incontinence. Simple clinical 
tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are 
non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence. Transrectal 
ultrasonography is a simple and quick out-patient procedure. The availability of 
ultrasound equipment in most clinics and the high sensitivity and specificity of 
the test make it an attractive and cost-effective alternative to X-ray 
cystography in the pre-operative evaluation of anatomical support to the 
urethrovesical junction."
3057312,"Heavy resistance training is associated with increased body weight, lean body 
mass, and muscle cross-sectional area. The increased muscle cross-sectional area 
is mainly brought about by hypertrophy of individual muscle fibers. There is a 
greater increase in the area of fast twitch fibers compared to slow twitch 
fibers. In addition, long-term heavy resistance training may produce fiber 
proliferation. Mitochondrial volume density decreases in proportion to muscle 
hypertrophy in response to training. Typically, no capillary neoformation occurs 
during strength training. Therefore, capillary density decreases consequent to 
heavy resistance training. It appears, though, that bodybuilders, relying on a 
high repetition training system, in contrast to Olympic weight- and power 
lifters, display a small increase in number of capillaries per fiber. Enzyme 
activities, reflecting oxidative potential; decrease during long-term heavy 
resistance training, resulting in muscle hypertrophy. Although glycogen storage 
capacity is enhanced in strength trained athletes, enzyme activities reflecting 
anaerobic metabolism do not increase in response to heavy resistance exercise."
3058076,"The sphincter of Oddi (SO) is critically located at the junction of the common 
bile duct (CBD), main pancreatic duct, and the duodenum. It is a high-pressure 
zone with phasic contractions that regulate bile and pancreatic juice flow. The 
SO is probably regulated by several gastrointestinal hormones, and its basal 
pressure and phasic contractions can be elevated or decreased significantly by 
exogenous drugs. Its role in gallstone formation is probably negligible, but 
severing the SO allows one to extract CBD stones with an endoscope. Abnormal 
function of the SO can cause biliarylike pain. Of patients with persistent pain 
after cholecystectomy, 14% have abnormal SO manometric findings. Endoscopic or 
surgical sphincterotomy can cure these patients of their pain. The SO may play a 
significant role in the development of pancreatitis in certain patients, either 
because of the relationship of the CBD orifice to the pancreatic duct orifice 
created by the SO or because of the response of the SO to exogenous agents, such 
as alcohol."
3068777,"The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the advantages of the 
chemo-morphological approach in the study of pathological material. On one hand, 
the analysis of selected pathological cases (amputations, spinal transections) 
is able to provide invaluable information concerning the cells of origin of 
certain spinal transmitters in the human being. On the other hand, chemical 
neuropathology allows a more precise identification of the neuronal nets or 
types that are involved in a disease process. This advantage is underlined by 
studies performed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this condition, certain 
modifications, such as the reductions of acetylcholinesterase, choline 
acetyltransferase, cholinergic muscarinic, glycine or TRH receptors, are 
probably a consequence of motoneuron degeneration. In contradistinction, other 
findings, such as specific metabolic changes of motoneurons or early 
disappearance of SP-containing fibers in lamina IX, might be relevant for the 
pathogenesis of the disease."
3069176,"It has been suggested that cyclosporin A might be of some benefit to patients 
with Crohn's disease. The clinical response and side-effects of cyclosporin A in 
Crohn's disease are described in a series of 13 adults. The majority of patients 
had ileal disease and all but one were started on an initial oral dose of 15 
mg/kg per day. Duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 42 weeks. Of the 13 
patients, 6 showed a response to therapy; the remainder showed no response or 
deteriorated. The commonest side-effect was hyperaesthesia, but one patient 
developed nephrotoxicity and one developed hepatotoxicity. Significant drug 
malabsorption occurred in one case. The side-effects were dose dependent and 
reversible. Cyclosporin A may have a part to play in the treatment of resistant 
Crohn's disease, and in our hands has been associated with a 46 per cent 
response rate; however, the precise role of cyclosporin A in the management of 
Crohn's disease awaits further study."
3080693,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of single doses of thyrotropin 
releasing hormone (TRH) was performed on 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. Each patient was given subcutaneous injections of TRH 150 mg or 
placebo, and IV infusions of TRH 500 mg or placebo at 72- to 96-hour intervals. 
Eight motor and functional ratings were scored at regular intervals after each 
injection. Side effects were seen in all patients and were obvious to patients 
and examiners, making true blinding impossible. Nevertheless, statistically 
significant improvement was seen only in dynametric strength 1 hour after 
subcutaneous injection (p less than 0.05). Significant improvement occurred, in 
one patient only, on subjective speech testing during IV infusion of TRH. In 
none of six other ratings was there a significant difference between TRH and 
placebo. Subjective improvement was noted by 11 of 12 patients."
3080694,"A double-blind controlled trial of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) 150 mg IM 
daily in 30 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is reported. The 
drug/placebo was administered for 2 months, followed by a 2-month ""wash-out"". 
Evaluation of strength, functional ability, and respiratory functions was 
performed. A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected 
following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was 
noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of 
any marked clinical significance. The course of the illness was not altered."
3080695,"We performed double-blind crossover trials to assess the effects of 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. 
For acute intravenous trials, 500 mg TRH or placebo with norepinephrine was 
given at 1-week intervals (16 patients). CSF TRH concentration increased, and 
clinical side effects appeared with TRH. For chronic studies, 25 mg TRH and a 
saline placebo were given subcutaneously every day for 3 months (25 patients). 
CSF TRH level increased 29-fold after a single TRH injection, and mild transient 
side effects occurred. Vital signs, respiratory function, semiquantitative and

testing, and EMG were studied. With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective 
improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening 
of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical 
analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH 
trials."
3083882,"The maximum thermogenic capacity of brown fat cells from control and cold 
acclimated rats was measured using a continuous-flow microcalorimetric system. 
The content of the 32.000 D, brown fat specific protein, thermogenin, was 
measured in the cells used for heat production measurements by competitive 
ELISA. The ratio between the maximal thermogenic capacity and the amount of 
thermogenin for control and cold acclimated rats was compared. It was found that 
the ratio between the two parameters decreased during cold acclimation due to a 
decrease in maximal thermogenic capacity and an increase in the amount of 
thermogenin, indicating regulation of heat production either at thermogenin or 
receptor level."
3084261,"Immunoelectron microscopy was performed to study the biosynthesis of lysosomal 
beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in normal and mutant human fibroblasts. Using 
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies we show in normal cells precursor forms of 
beta-gal in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and in the Golgi apparatus 
throughout the stack of cisternae. In the lysosomes virtually all beta-gal 
exists as a high molecular weight multimer of mature enzyme. In the autosomal 
recessive disease GM1-gangliosidosis caused by a beta-gal deficiency and in 
galactosialidosis, associated with a combined deficiency of lysosomal 
neuraminidase and beta-gal, precursor forms of the latter enzyme are found in 
RER, Golgi and some labeling is present at the cell surface. The lysosomes 
remain unlabeled, indicative for the absence of enzyme molecules in this 
organelle. In galactosialidosis fibroblasts also no mature beta-gal is found in 
the lysosomes but in these cells the presence of the monomeric form can be 
increased by leupeptin (inhibition of proteolysis) whereas addition of a partly 
purified 32 kDa ""protective protein"" results in the restoration of high 
molecular weight beta-gal multimers in the lysosomes."
3085152,"After heterotopically grafting premigratory neural crest cells from quail 
embryos to the wing buds of chicken embryos, Schwann cells, non-epidermal 
melanocytes and epidermal melanocytes develop in the wings of the host embryos. 
This indicates that these neural crest derived cell populations are determined 
before the onset of emigration of neural crest cells from the crest. Epidermal 
melanocytes of donor origin are found essentially distally from the grafts, 
whereas non-epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells are found proximally and 
distally therefrom. If the apical ectodermal ridge is removed from wing buds 
that have received a graft of neural crest cells, the directionality of the 
migration of epidermal melanocytes is lost. This indicates that the apical 
ectodermal ridge might account for the directional movement of epidermal 
melanoblasts. This situation is compared to myoblasts that behave in a similar 
way within the avian embryonic wing bud."
3086870,"The polypeptide composition of the phycobilisome, the major light-harvesting 
complex of prokaryotic cyanobacteria and certain eukaryotic algae, can be 
modulated by different light qualities in cyanobacteria exhibiting chromatic 
adaptation. We have identified genomic fragments encoding a cluster of 
phycobilisome polypeptides (phycobiliproteins) from the chromatically adapting 
cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon using previously characterized DNA 
fragments of phycobiliprotein genes from the eukaryotic alga Cyanophora paradoxa 
and from F. diplosiphon. Characterization of two lambda-EMBL3 clones containing 
overlapping genomic fragments indicates that three sets of phycobiliprotein 
genes--the alpha- and beta-allophycocyanin genes plus two sets of alpha- and 
beta-phycocyanin genes--are clustered within 13 kilobases on the cyanobacterial 
genome and transcribed off the same strand. The gene order 
(alpha-allophycocyanin followed by beta-allophycocyanin and beta-phycocyanin 
followed by alpha-phycocyanin) appears to be a conserved arrangement found 
previously in a eukaryotic alga and another cyanobacterium. We have reported 
that one set of phycocyanin genes is transcribed as two abundant red 
light-induced mRNAs (1600 and 3800 bases). We now present data showing that the 
allophycocyanin genes and a second set of phycocyanin genes are transcribed into 
major mRNAs of 1400 and 1600 bases, respectively. These transcripts are present 
in RNA isolated from cultures grown in red and green light, although lower 
levels of the 1600-base phycocyanin transcript are present in cells grown in 
green light. Furthermore, a larger transcript of 1750 bases hybridizes to the 
allophycocyanin genes and may be a precursor to the 1400-base species."
3088302,"Cerebral lipids of patients with GM1-gangliosidoses, infantile, juvenile, and 
chronic type which are caused by deficiency of beta-galactosidase, were examined 
and compared to each other. The infantile type demonstrated abnormal 
accumulation of GM1 and asialo-GM1 in contrast with marked decrease in such 
major cerebral lipids as cholesterol, phospholipids, cerebroside, and sulfatide. 
It was also noted that significant amounts of such unusual lipids as free fatty 
acids, GlcCer, LacCer, GbOse3Cer, and GbOse-4Cer plus nLcOse4Cer were found in 
the brain. These findings pointed out that this infantile type might accompany a 
severe cerebral dysgenesis with poor myelination. The juvenile type also showed 
marked increase in GM1 and asialo-GM1, but the decrease in cholesterol, 
phospholipids, cerebroside, and sulfatide was not so much as the infantile type. 
These findings along with the occurrence of cholesterol ester suggested that the 
brain caused progressive demyelination after the immature myelin appeared. An 
autopsized brain tissue of a male patient who was eventually diagnosed as a case 
of GM1-gangliosidosis chronic type after his death, showed some accumulation of 
GM1 and asialo-GM1 particularly in the caudate nucleus and putamen, whereas it 
showed moderate amounts of GM1 in apparently normal gray and white matters. It 
seemed that there are no abnormal cerebral lipids except for gangliosides and 
some neutral glycosphingolipids in the chronic type."
3088700,"Nine patients (7 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 1 with progressive spinal 
amyotrophy and 1 with chronic anterior poliomyelitis) were treated by sequential 
intravenous administration of 240 mg of TRH over one hour every two weeks. 
Results were assessed by an analytical evaluation of muscle strength before and 
24 h after each infusion and by objective and subjective evaluation of 
spasticity. Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted 
in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a 
sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. Continued use of 
this therapy is justified by the need to determine its long-term effects and the 
psychological improvement noted in some patients after an even transient 
improvement in motor performance. However this treatment is obviously not 
curative."
3091628,"In a pilot therapeutic trial, four patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) were treated with long term, continuous infusions of TRH, three 
intrathecally and one epidurally. They had prompt increases in serum TSH and 
thyroid hormone concentrations, averaging 120% for TSH, 49% for serum T4, 68% 
for the serum free T4 index, 49% for serum T3, and 67% for the serum free T3 
index. These elevations were statistically significant for all but serum T3 and 
persisted for the duration of treatment (4-7 months). Mean values during 
treatment were near the upper limit of normal for each of these hormone 
measurements. After TRH withdrawal, serum TSH fell transiently below the normal 
range. A comparison group of four patients with ALS treated by twice weekly 
intrathecal bolus doses of TRH had no significant changes in serum TSH, T4, or 
T3. During continuous TRH treatment, the responsiveness of both TSH and PRL to a 
standard iv TRH stimulation test was blunted, but not abolished. Basal serum PRL 
was occasionally elevated in the two women during continuous TRH treatment, but 
was normal in the men, and serum GH was normal in all patients. In the patients 
receiving continuous TRH treatment, indexes of end-organ effects of thyroid 
hormone were inconclusive; none had a rise in serum ferritin, one of four had a 
rise in serum sex hormone-binding globulin, and three had increased creatinuria. 
These results provide direct evidence in man that chronic TRH administration can 
cause modest sustained increases in serum TSH and thyroid hormones, though the 
metabolic consequences of these changes are uncertain, and appears to raise the 
set-point of the pituitary-thyroid axis, i.e. the serum T4 and T3 concentrations 
needed for a given degree of suppression of basal TSH secretion."
3097367,"Despite the efforts of many workers, the cause and therapy has not been 
clarified. We carried out the therapeutic trial of thyrotropin releasing hormone 
(TRH) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from January, 1979 to January, 
1983. There were 16 subjects. The patients were given a low dose (0.5-2 mg) of 
TRH intravenously or intramusculary. Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 
(56%) of 16 patients. TRH has been reported to have the activating effects on 
the pyramidal tract, brainstem motor nuclei, and motoneuron in the spinal cord 
as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. We thought such action of TRH to be 
useful to the therapy of ALS."
3100113,"A 2.5-year-old girl who presented with abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, 
coarse facies, hirsutism and contraction deformities was investigated for 
mucopolysaccharidoses. Urinary excretion showed increased total 
glycosaminoglycans (105 mg/mmol creatinine; normal for age 9-20 mg/mmol) with 
marked increases of dermatan and heparan sulphates. A number of lysosomal enzyme 
activities were measured on leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal 
or high activities were found for alpha-iduronidase, 
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase, beta-galactosidase, arylsulphatase B and 
beta-glucuronidase. However a marked deficiency of iduronate sulphate sulphatase 
activity was observed, consistent with a diagnosis of Hunter's disease. 
Activities were reduced to less than 2% of mean control values in the patient's 
leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal activities were measured in 
samples from the father and younger sister but a partial deficiency (43% of 
control serum) was found in the mother. Chromosome studies on the patient 
revealed a partial deletion of the long arm of one X-chromosome, most probably 
of band Xq25, which was not inherited from either parent. Studies using BrdU 
indicated that the deleted X chromosome was consistently late replicating, and 
as a result the Hunter gene was fully expressed on the other X chromosome."
3101339,"The effects of endurance training and season on the function of the anterior 
pituitary-thyroid axis were studied in 18 female runners and their 12 controls, 
and in 13 joggers and their 11 controls in Northern Finland, with a large 
seasonal difference in environmental factors. The serum concentrations of 
thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), 
thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and oestradiol (E2) were measured during one 
menstrual cycle in the light training season (autumn) and in the hard training 
season (spring). The responses of TSH to intravenous TRH stimulation were also 
measured in the luteal phase of the cycle during the hard training season. 
Endurance running did not affect the basal or TRH-stimulated serum TSH 
concentrations, while those of T4 and fT4 in runners were lowered in both 
seasons and that of T3 in the light training season in relation to control 
subjects. The serum concentrations of TBG were also significantly lower in 
runners than their controls in the luteal phase in both seasons. The effect of 
jogging on thyroid hormones was less pronounced. Serum concentrations of TSH, 
T4, fT4, T3 and TBG were generally slightly higher in spring than in autumn. 
Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the 
thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG 
levels than due to direct effect of training. In spring the function of anterior 
pituitary-thyroid axis is more active than in autumn."
3103858,"Immunocytochemistry has revealed that nerve fibers within the neural and 
intermediate lobes of the rat pituitary gland contain 5-hydroxytryptamine 
(5-HT). Recent anatomical evidence suggests that the content of this amine in 
the intermediate but not the neural lobe of the pituitary gland may represent 
5-HT that has been taken up from the blood rather than synthesized 
intraneuronally. The purpose of this study was to determine if 5-HT is 
synthesized in neurons of the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. 
5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT 
precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male 
Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of 
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Thirty min following the injection of NSD 
1015 (100 mg/kg, i.p.), 5-HTP accumulated in the neurointermediate lobe and the 
rate of this accumulation was increased by the administration of the 5-HTP 
precursor, tryptophan, and by electrical stimulation of the pituitary stalk. In 
addition, repeated injections of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 
mg/kg, i.p., every 12 h for a total of 7 injections), induced a marked depletion 
of platelet 5-HT but did not alter the concentration of 5-HT in either the 
neural or intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. Taken together these 
results indicate that much of the 5-HT in the neurointermediate lobe of the 
pituitary gland does not represent 5-HT taken up from the blood, but rather the 
amine is synthesized in neurons projecting to this region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 
250 WORDS)"
3104750,"Focal, small-to-moderate and transient improvement occurred in the muscle 
strength and function of patients with ALS who received TRH in dose-response and 
screening studies. In a small pilot study of 12 patients, 3 months 
administration of TRH at 10 mg per kg on alternate days resulted in localized 
increased strength of jaw muscles as well as significant improvement in lower 
extremity function. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in 
patients with ALS following administration of TRH. Autonomic effects of TRH on 
heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure were not serious and attenuated 
slightly over the course of the study."
3104751,"Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) has potential therapeutic applications in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related diseases because of its function 
as a neuroregulator of the anterior horn cell. However, its therapeutic 
potential, and that of other neuropeptides, is reduced by the blood-brain 
barrier that limits access to neuronal cells. We have thus explored the direct 
intrathecal administration of TRH in ALS, with both short-term boluses and 
infusions and chronic constant infusions. Our experience suggests that this 
approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful 
evaluation."
3104820,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone has been reported to increase strength in patients 
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). DN-1417 is an analog of 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which has less endocrinologic activity, but more 
anterior horn cell stimulating effect (with no ""autorefractory state""). However, 
2 mg DN-1417, IM twice a day for 1 month in an open-label trial, produced no 
objective improvement of strength in nine patients with ALS. No patient entered 
the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the trial."
3146524,"Multiple sub-vital effects, here designated as reductions in fitness S1-S5, for 
the second chromosome gene 'daughterless' (da) of Drosophila melanogaster were 
described as (S1) a recessive maternal lethality for daughters, (S2) a reduced 
fertility of da/da females, (S3) a recessive sub-vital zygotic effect, (S4) a 
recessive female-specific zygotic effect and (S5) a recessive maternal 
interaction effect on sons. (For S1-3 see also: Bell, 1954; Sandler, 1972; 
Cline, 1976). These five distinct effects were initially quantified from 
estimates of viability in single generation crossing experiments. Dynamic 
estimates of these fitness parameters were obtained by fitting the elimination 
rate of da from a series of large random mating cage populations to a recurrence 
equation by the method of minimum chi-square. The stability of these estimates 
discerns those effects which are truly pleiotropic versus those due to linked 
genes. The dynamic estimates supported only S1 and S4 effects. Evidence for S2 
and S5 was indeterminate, but the S3 effect was rejected (P less than 0.01). The 
observed reduction in fitness, supposedly due to this recessive zygotic effect 
for da, was most likely the result of linked deleterious genes. These results 
indicate that pleiotropic vital effects observed in single generation test-cross 
matings may be caused by linked genes rather than the specific mutant per se. 
This problem is of particular importance when the mutant allele has been 
maintained with a balancer chromosome. Experiments on the rescue of daughters 
from da/da mothers with low temperatures during embryogenesis and with 
dechorionation of eggs were described in which the findings failed to confirm 
previously reported actions of the da gene. Modifying genes rather than 
environmental variables were cited as the probable cause for these conflicting 
results."
3146705,"In view of earlier reports in the literature it was tried to use TRH 
(thyrotropin releasing hormone) in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TRH 
was given during 3 weeks once daily intravenously in drip infusions in a 0.4 mg 
dose. For objectivization of the results the muscle power was assessed using a 
five-grade scale of Lovette. TRH effect on EMG was analysed also. It was found 
that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no 
improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%. 
However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the 
progression of the disease."
3147318,"Sixteen patients with motor neuron disease received RX77368, a TRH analogue, IV, 
repeatedly over 1-12 weeks (median 2 weeks). Slight to moderate improvement in 
bulbar function, particularly speech, was reproduced or persisted with repeated 
infusions in 8 of 12 responders over a median of 18 days (range 14-90) during 
the period of study. Cramps (5/9) and spasticity (5/8) improved for a median of 
14 days (range 7-35) and 7 days (range 2-14) respectively. The highest 
benefit/side effect ratio was seen with 0.2 mg/kg (0.15 mg/kg in those with 
severe bulbar palsy) every 3-4 days. Long term studies with this analogue in MND 
are indicated."
3148185,"Effects of high-dose TRH on the vibratory inhibition of soleus H-reflex have 
been studied in 9 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In 6 of the 9, 
TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that 
the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in 
presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres."
3148186,"Eight patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis received 500 mg TRH by IV 
infusion, at a progressive rate during 3 hours. Only 3 patients noted subjective 
improvement of strength. Clinical muscular testing and H response study failed 
to show any change. Moreover modifications of the prolactin, growth hormone, TSH 
and T3 serum levels raise a question concerning the tolerance with long term 
utilization of TRH."
3158290,"Heavy alcohol use has been suspected to cause acute atrial fibrillation, but an 
association between these two common problems has never been demonstrated. We 
retrospectively reviewed 64 cases with idiopathic acute atrial fibrillation and 
64 age- and sex-matched controls, randomly selected from among general medical 
admissions. Sixty-two percent of cases and 33% of controls had documentation as 
heavy users of alcohol. Furthermore, patients with alcohol-related atrial 
fibrillation were significantly more likely to manifest alcohol withdrawal 
syndrome than were other inpatients with heavy alcohol use. Patients with 
alcohol-related acute atrial fibrillation were not different from other patients 
with acute atrial fibrillation with respect to clinical evidence of congestive 
heart failure, electrocardiographic abnormalities, cardiomegaly, electrolyte 
disturbance, or response to therapy. Heavy alcohol use is an important potential 
etiology for acute atrial fibrillation; alcohol withdrawal may represent a 
particular risk for such alcohol-related atrial fibrillation."
3162101,"Retinoic acid, an analogue of vitamin A, is known to be teratogenic in 
laboratory animals and has recently been implicated in a few clinical case 
reports. To study the human teratogenicity of this agent, we investigated 154 
human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a retinoid prescribed for 
severe recalcitrant cystic acne. The outcomes were 95 elective abortions, 26 
infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed 
infants. A subset of 36 of the 154 pregnancies was observed prospectively. The 
outcomes in this cohort were 8 spontaneous abortions, 23 normal infants, and 5 
malformed infants. Exposure to isotretinoin was associated with an unusually 
high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk = 
25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). Among the 21 malformed 
infants we found a characteristic pattern of malformation involving 
craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures. The 
malformations included microtia/anotia (15 infants), micrognathia (6), cleft 
palate (3), conotruncal heart defects and aortic-arch abnormalities (8), thymic 
defects (7), retinal or optic-nerve abnormalities (4), and central nervous 
system malformations (18). The pattern of malformation closely resembled that 
produced in animal studies of retinoid teratogenesis. It is possible that a 
major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on 
cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial, 
cardiac, and thymic malformations."
3162748,"Keratolenticular dysgenesis (Peters' anomaly) was induced in mice by exposure to 
the human teratogens, ethanol or 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin, Accutane). 
Acute teratogen exposure on the seventh day of gestation (corresponding to the 
third week of human gestation) resulted in an eye malformation incidence of 46% 
to 100% in day 14 fetuses. Of the abnormal eyes, 10% to 29% demonstrated failure 
of detachment of the lens from the surface ectoderm. Delayed lens detachment was 
seen as anterior lenticonus in 33% to 35% of the abnormal eyes. Abnormal lens 
detachment appeared to result in mechanical interference with neural crest 
migration to form the corneal stroma and endothelium, and iris stroma. This 
secondary effect on neural crest derivatives is exhibited in the adult animals 
as corneal opacities associated with defects in Descemet's membrane and 
endothelium, and anterior polar cataracts."
3164411,"Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) may occur as an isolated autosomal dominant 
trait or as a feature of Williams syndrome. It has been suggested that a defect 
in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome. We have excluded 
calcitonin as a candidate gene for SVAS using a gene specific probe."
3166398,"Blood group A, B, H, Le, Leb, Lex, and Ley antigenicity as well as the 
expression of CA 19-9 were examined in pancreatic cancer specimens from 30 
patients, using monoclonal antibodies to the respective antigen and 
immunohistochemical techniques, and the findings were correlated with the blood 
group types (ABO and Lewis) of the individuals. Compatible antigen expression 
was found in 82, 75, and 50% of tumors from patients with A, B, and O blood 
group types, respectively. Deletion of the compatible antigen was found in 10 
(33%) of the cases, predominantly in patients of blood group O type, and 
incompatible expression (of B antigen only) in 4 (13%). Lea was detected in 87%, 
Leb in 90%, Lex in 30%, and Ley in 43% of the specimens, regardless of ABH and 
Lewis phenotype of the patients. Coexpression of Lea and Leb was found in 87%, 
of Lex and Ley in 13%, of Lea and Lex in 23%, and of Leb and Ley in 40% of the 
cases. CA 19-9 was expressed in 80% of the tumors; it was present in the tumor 
tissue of 21 of 22 patients from Lea-b+, in all 4 individuals from Lea+b-, but 
in none of the 4 patients from Lea-b- phenotype (P less than 0.01). 
Heterogeneity in the expression of each of the antigens was found. The overall 
results indicate that blood group antigen expression in pancreatic tumor differs 
from that of other gastrointestinal cancers and that the Lewis antigen 
expression in pancreatic cancer cells is independent of the blood group 
phenotype of the patients and thus may be useful as a tumor marker."
3174510,"Astrocytic reaction to perinatal brain damage, which is caused by 
hyperammonemia, liver disease, hyperbilirubinemia, and a few other conditions, 
was studied using immunohistochemical methods for the demonstration of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We found no increase in GFAP expression in 
those areas where Alzheimer II astrocytes usually proliferate. Diffuse 
astrocytic proliferation in the white matter and focal reaction in gray matter, 
which we ascribe to complicating factors, the foremost of which is anoxia, was 
found in many of the cases."
3178044,"Eighteen patients with primary gastric lymphomas and two with pseudolymphomas 
treated at the University of Louisville affiliated hospitals were analyzed in 
order to develop a more precise understanding of these rare diseases. Abdominal 
pain and weight loss were the most common initial symptoms. Only one patient 
presented with an abdominal mass. Upper GI series were helpful but failed to 
show a definite abnormality in two of 18 cases. Endoscopic examinations in all 
18 were compatible with malignancy on gross finding, but six out of 15 
endoscopic biopsies were not conclusive. All four cases, which proved fatal in 
less than two years, showed serosal invasion and diffuse histological pattern. 
On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that in patients with abdominal pain 
and weight loss of more than two months duration an aggressive course of 
evaluation should include upper gastrointestinal x ray and repeated endoscopic 
biopsy. If symptoms persist, laparotomy and biopsy may be warranted even if 
endoscopic biopsy shows no neoplasm. Curative surgery is the treatment of 
choice, but radiation therapy should be added in patients with serosal 
involvement. Very careful histological assessment of pseudolymphomas is 
necessary, because they may contain malignant lymphoma."
3181644,"Numerous experimental studies have implied a link between diabetes-induced 
abnormal lipid buildup in the myocardium and the development of cardiomyopathy. 
Because the diabetic state in rats is associated with lowered T3 
(triiodothyronine) and T4 levels and because diabetic patients excrete large 
amounts of myo-inositol, a lipotropic agent, we investigated the effects of 
myo-inositol and T3 on the elevated myocardial lipid levels and depressed 
cardiac performance of streptozocin (55 mg/kg i.v.)-induced diabetic (STZ-D) 
rats. myo-inositol (2.5 g.kg-1.day-1 in the drinking water) and T3 (30 
micrograms.kg-1.day-1 s.c.) were given for an 8-wk period 3 days after diabetes 
induction. Untreated diabetic rats were characterized by a decreased rate of 
body weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hypoinsulinemia, which were not altered 
after myo-inositol and/or T3 treatment. Thyroid status of diabetic animals was 
normalized by T3 alone or in combination with myo-inositol but not by 
myo-inositol alone. The elevations in plasma and myocardial lipids associated 
with the diabetic state were prevented by myo-inositol treatment. However, the 
plasma lipid and myocardial cholesterol levels in diabetic rats remained 
elevated or were further increased with treatment with T3 or myo-inositol plus 
T3. myo-inositol treatment partially improved cardiac performance in STZ-D rats. 
T3 treatment alone did not prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. There 
was, however, some improvement in heart function in the groups treated with both 
myo-inositol and T3, coinciding with a significant decrease in the myocardial 
triacylglycerol level. The data indicate that a possible correlation may exist 
between elevated myocardial triacylglycerol levels and cardiac dysfunction in 
diabetic rats."
3186440,"Unmethylated CpG rich islands are a feature of vertebrate DNA: they are 
associated with housekeeping and many tissue specific genes. CpG islands on the 
active X chromosome of mammals are also unmethylated. However, islands on the 
inactive X chromosome are heavily methylated. We have identified a CpG island in 
the 5' region of the G6PD gene, and two islands forty Kb 3' from the G6PD gene, 
on the human X chromosome. Expression of the G6PD gene is associated with 
concordant demethylation of all three CpG islands. We have shown that one of the 
two islands is in the promoter region of a housekeeping gene, GdX. In this paper 
we show that the second CpG island is also associated with a gene, P3. The P3 
gene has no homology to previously described genes. It is a single copy, 4 kb 
gene, conserved in evolution, and it has the features of a housekeeping two 
genes is within the CpG island and that sequences in the islands have promoter 
function."
3189330,"Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a disorder manifesting the severe brain 
malformation lissencephaly (""smooth brain""), is caused, in the majority of 
cases, by a chromosomal microdeletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 17. 
Using human chromosome 17-specific DNA probes, we have begun a molecular 
dissection of the critical region for MDS. To localize cloned DNA sequences to 
the MDS critical region, a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel was 
constructed which includes hybrids containing the abnormal chromosome 17 from 
three MDS patients with deletions of various sizes. Three genes (myosin heavy 
chain 2, tumor antigen p53, and RNA polymerase II) previously mapped to 17p were 
excluded from the MDS deletion region and therefore are unlikely to play a role 
in its pathogenesis. In contrast, three highly polymorphic anonymous probes, 
YNZ22.1 (D17S5), YNH37.3 (D17S28), and 144-D6 (D17S34), were deleted in each of 
four patients with visible deletions, including one with a ring chromosome 17 
that is deleted for a portion of the single telomeric prometaphase subband 
p13.3. In two MDS patients with normal chromosomes, a combination of somatic 
cell hybrid, RFLP, and densitometric studies demonstrated deletion for YNZ22.1 
and YNH37.3 in the paternally derived 17's of both patients, one of whom is also 
deleted for 144-D6. The results indicate that MDS can be caused by 
submicroscopic deletion and raises the possibility that all MDS patients will 
prove to have deletions at a molecular level. The two probes lie within a 
critical region of less than 3,000 kb and constitute potential starting points 
in the isolation of genes implicated in the severe brain maldevelopment in MDS."
3191000,"Systemic cardiovascular effects during chronic treatment with topical minoxidil 
vs placebo were evaluated using a double-blind, randomized design for two 
parallel groups (n = 20 for minoxidil, n = 15 for placebo). During 6 months of 
follow-up, blood pressure did not change, whereas minoxidil increased heart rate 
by 3-5 beats min-1. Compared with placebo, topical minoxidil caused significant 
increases in LV end-diastolic volume, in cardiac output (by 0.751 min-1) and in 
LV mass (by 5 g m-2). We conclude that in healthy subjects short-term use of 
topical minoxidil is likely not to be detrimental. However, safety needs to be 
established regarding ischaemic symptoms in patients with coronary artery 
disease as well as for the possible development of LV hypertrophy in healthy 
subjects during years of therapy."
3197644,"When activated by dithiothreitol, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (I-5'D) activity 
in kidney microsomes is less sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil (PTU) 
and iopanoate (IOP) at nanomolar, compared to micromolar, substrate 
concentrations. The enzymatic activities at nanomolar substrate concentrations 
are, however, completely eliminated in the presence of a combination of 10 
microM IOP and 100 microM PTU. In this report we present evidence that 1) the 
relative PTU insensitivity results from the residual activities of the high Km 
enzyme which, while being very sensitive to PTU inhibition at micromolar 
substrate concentrations, becomes progressively less PTU sensitive as substrate 
concentrations decline relative to its Km; and 2) the relative IOP insensitivity 
is due to the presence in kidney microsomes of a low Km enzyme which is 
relatively insensitive to IOP, but highly sensitive to inhibition by PTU. 
Classifying the deiodinases on the basis of PTU sensitivity, therefore, requires 
that not only the thiol concentrations, but, as in the case of the type I 
enzyme, also the substrate concentrations be specified. The PTU resistance of 
the type I enzyme at nanomolar substrate concentrations suggests a role of this 
enzyme in T3 neogenesis in PTU-treated animals."
3203701,"The first German family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS) is 
described, with electrophysiologic and myopathologic results providing evidence 
of a primary neurogenic disease. According to classification of the scapulo 
peroneal syndrome without cardiomyopathy, we conclude that there are two 
variants of EDS: one myopathic, the other neurogenic in origin. Therefore, the 
term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of 
EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive 
or autosomal dominant inheritance."
3208208,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a good method of 
visualizing the lesions in MS. We have studied several applications of MRI to 
the evaluation of patients and experimental models. In diagnosis, MRI is the 
most sensitive test for the demonstration of dissemination of lesions in space. 
Pathological correlation studies show that MRI reliably measures the extent of 
chronic demyelination. Experimental studies show that MRI detects acute 
inflammatory lesions and measures their evolution. MRI also is a reliable 
measure of the extent of the MS process, serial MRI scans detect evidence of 
disease activity in MS not always disclosed by clinical evaluation. MRI will 
have an enormous future impact on the evaluation of patients in clinical studies 
and in understanding the evolution of pathological processes."
3209676,"Recent evidence has demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or 
isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the 
rodent and human embryo. Our studies have been directed toward understanding 
this effect using mouse whole embryo and primary cell cultures. In whole embryo 
culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, 
especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. In embryos explanted 
on day 10 of gestation and exposed for 24 or 48 hr, the mesenchyme beneath the 
epithelium of the nasal and maxillary processes contained pyknotic nuclei as 
well as a dramatically reduced number of nuclei incorporating 3H-thymidine. The 
secondary palatal processes and the roof of the oral-nasal cavity had fewer 
mesenchymal cells than control embryos. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into 
TCA-insoluble macromolecules was 30% less in the retinoid-treated heads. In 
primary cell cultures from day-12 mouse secondary palatal mesenchyme, subsequent 
cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) 
M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells 
were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic 
acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine 
incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal 
mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial 
malformations."
3211135,"The expression of Tetrahymena surface proteins serotype H3 (SerH3) and serotype 
T (SerT) is under environmental regulation. SerH3 is expressed when cells are 
incubated between the temperatures of 20 and 35 degrees C, while SerT is 
expressed when cells are grown at temperatures above 35 degrees C. Using a SerH3 
cDNA clone as a hybridization probe, we determined that (i) the SerH3 gene is a 
member of a multigene family; (ii) most members of this multigene family are 
variably rearranged during macronuclear development; and (iii) the gene which 
produces the SerH3 mRNA is reproducibly rearranged during macronuclear 
development."
3219911,"Specific chromosome domains in interphase nuclei of neurons and glia were 
studied by three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of serial optical sections 
from in situ hybridized human CNS tissue. Overall patterns of centromere 
organization, delineated with alphoid repeats, were comparable to those seen in 
mouse, and are clearly conserved in mammalian evolution. Cloned probes from 
other individual chromosome domains were used to define interphase organization 
more precisely. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In 
large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one 
homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, 
while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear 
membrane. A telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar 
centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. In astrocytes, these three 
chromosome regions were on the membrane and not necessarily associated with 
nucleoli. Therefore there are different patterns of interphase chromosome 
organization in functionally distinct cell types. In contrast to the above 
domains, a 1p36.3 telomeric sequence embedded in a large Alu-rich and early 
replicating chromosome region, was always found in an interior euchromatic 
nuclear compartment in both neurons and glial cells. In double hybridizations 
with 1q12 and 1p36.3 probes, 1p arms were clearly separated in all cells, and 
arms projected radially into the interior nucleoplasm with non-Rabl 
orientations. There was no absolute or rigid position for each 1p arm with 
respect to each other or to the major dendrite, indicating that individual 
chromosome arms may be dynamically positioned even in highly differentiated cell 
types. We suggest that centromeric and other highly repeated non-transcribed 
sequence domains may act as general organizing centers for cell type specific 
interphase patterns that are conserved in mammalian evolution. Such centers 
would allow selected groups of chromosome arms to extend into (and contract 
from) an interior, presumably transcriptionally active, nuclear compartment."
3221205,"Result of a family study based on 584 patients with craniostenosis brings some 
answers useful for genetic counselling. For 98 patients (15%) a syndrome is 
associated. Third part of them has Apert syndrome, an other third part has 
Crouzon syndrome, and for the last third more exceptional acrocephalosyndactyly 
syndrome (Saethre-Chotzen, Pfeiffer) or others atypical associations, sometimes 
not yet described, but with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Non syndromic 
craniostenosis involves differently according to the type of join, but the 
localization is the same if recurrence will be happen. Coronal craniostenosis 
seems to be a dominant autosomal character, when scaphocephaly is more often 
sporadic; for both, an autosomal dominant inheritance is not excluded for some 
pedigrees. If the recurrence risk exist in some cases, it is generally well 
accepted by parents on account of the good neurosurgeon prognosis."
3221855,"A complex study on various evolutionary peculiarities of the mammalia dispersed 
Alu repeats (Alu repeats of primates and B1 of rodents) has been carried out by 
phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree, containing the 7SL RNA genes and the 
Alu repeats of primates and rodents has been constructed. It has been shown that 
the branch of the phyletic line leading to the Alu repeats of primates and B1 of 
rodents from the 7SL RNA genes occurred after the divergence of the 7SL RNA 
genes of amphibia and mammalia, but before the divergence of the 7SL RNA genes 
of primates and rodents (250.10 years ago). A statistically reliable slowing 
down in the evolutionary rates of one of two monomers for the human Alu repeats 
has been proved. It may be caused by the functional load of the corresponding 
monomer in connection with the presence of a definit regulatory site in it."
3227315,"In many tissues, carcinogenesis mimics embryonic development. This is true for 
the pancreas. The first alteration seen during pancreatic tumor induction in the 
hamster model is proliferation of poorly differentiated ductular (tubular) 
structures intermingled with endocrine cells, a pattern consistent with findings 
in the embryonic and fetal pancreas. However, unlike the fetal tissue, various 
cell types of intestinal epithelium appear in the advance stages of pancreatic 
carcinogenesis. Moreover, contrary to the situation in the fetal and adult 
hamster pancreas, the induced pancreatic lesion expresses antigens with human 
blood group type specificities, including A, B, H, Leb, Lex, and Ley, antigens 
that are expressed, however, by fetal and adult duodenal epithelium. Considering 
the origin of the pancreas from the duodenal mucosa, the overall findings 
indicate that during pancreatic carcinogenesis some genes, acquired from the 
progenitor (duodenal) cells, which are inactive in embryonic and normal 
pancreatic cells, are activated, possibly as a function of some oncogenes. 
Comparative studies in human tissue lead to the same conclusion."
3228056,"The Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome consists of recurrent edema of the lips, 
intermittent facial edema and a furrowed tongue. This is the classic triad which 
defines the syndrome, although it is accepted that the presence of two 
manifestations is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Distribution is universal 
although the majority of the cases are described in the European literature. The 
case of a 37 year-old female is presented. She came to consult for persistent 
edema of the upper lip, of a three-year duration, which started abruptly without 
any clear etiologic correlation with acute episodes that disappear spontaneously 
or with corticoid treatment. Associated symptoms included migraine headaches 
which started years earlier. The complimentary examinations were normal except 
for a mild elevation of the sedimentary rate, and the biopsy was compatible with 
granulomatous cheilitis. In conclusion, MRS has to be considered as a diagnostic 
possibility in a patient who consulted for recurrent edema associated with other 
dermatologic and neurologic manifestations, although not necessarily having the 
complete triad."
3228132,"We have studied a boy with progeria (Hutchinson Gilford) born to third cousins. 
Four other individuals with progeria were born in another consanguineous sibship

3230497,"We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator 
with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver 
pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) 
fracture/dislocations. The pelves were quasi-statically loaded in longitudinal 
compression and loss of reduction (i.e., failure) was defined as 1.5 cm of 
diastasis at either of the fracture/dislocation sites. The Orthofix frame-pelvis 
complex (four 6-mm half-pins) was comparable to the PTF-pelvis complex (eight 
5-mm half-pins) in terms of load to failure and overall stiffness, but was 4-7 
times stiffer at lower load levels. Both frame-and-pin complexes deformed 
moderately at the pin-bone interface, but, while the PTF also showed moderate 
displacement between frame components, the Orthofix had almost no frame 
intercomponent motion."
3278568,"Amblyopia, commonly known as ""lazy eye,"" is a frequent but preventable cause of 
decreased vision. An anatomically normal eye, free from organic disease, has 
reduced vision compared with the other eye. Ptosis of the eyelids, strabismus, 
certain refractive disorders and other abnormalities may precede amblyopia. If 
discovered early enough, usually before the age of five, amblyopia can often be 
reversed."
3280983,"Some of the molecular aspects of methyl-directed mismatch repair in E. coli have 
been characterized. These include: mismatch recognition by mutS protein in which 
different mispairs are bound with different affinities; the direct involvement 
of d(GATC) sites; and strand scission by mutH protein at d(GATC) sequences with 
strand selection based on methylation of the DNA at those sites. In addition, 
communication over a distance between a mismatch and d(GATC) sites has been 
implicated. Analysis of mismatch correction in a defined system (Lahue et al., 
unpublished) should provide a direct means to further molecular aspects of this 
process."
3282561,"Experiments are reviewed that allow one to assign naturally occurring 
DNA-containing plasmas to either of two classes by virtue of their sensitivity 
to aggregation upon dehydration in organic solvents. The interphase nuclei of 
higher cells are relatively insensitive, while the DNA plasmas represented by 
bacterial nucleoids, vegetative bacteriophage and the chromosomes of 
dinoflagellates are sensitive. In higher cells the bulk of DNA is organised with 
histones in the form of nucleosomes. In prokaryotes and in the pool of 
vegetative phage DNA the most abundant histone-like protein HU is not associated 
with the bulk DNA, but localised in the border region with ribosomes where 
transcription and translation occur. These experimental results strongly suggest 
that the two classes of DNA plasmas are distinguishable by a low (1:10) or high 
(1:1) protein-to-DNA ratio. The hypothesis is formulated that the vegetative DNA 
(replicating and transcribing), throughout the living world, is nucleosome-free; 
during evolution, nucleosomes would have been introduced as a simple and 
adequate means for compacting the resting DNA. Condensation of DNA does not 
occur with prokaryotic nucleoids, but does take place when DNA is withdrawn from 
the vegetative phage pool to become packaged into phage heads. Dinoflagellate 
chromosomes are rather condensed although structurally different from eukaryotic 
chromosomes (e.g., those from Euglena) and are much more aggregation-sensitive."

3287769,"Chronic invasive fibrous thyroiditis (Riedel's struma) is a very rare disease of 
unknown aetiology mainly affecting middle-aged or old female patients. An 
aggressive fibrosis partly or totally replaces normal thyroid gland tissue. The 
gland becomes stony hard, is not displaceable and, characteristically, the 
fibrous tissue penetrates the capsule and infiltrates into surrounding 
structures such as muscles, vessels, nerves and even the trachea. Riedel's 
struma is often associated with fibrotic processes in other parts of the body. 
The preoperative differential diagnosis includes malignant tumours and fibrosing 
stages of Hashimoto's disease, as well as subacute thyroiditis de Quervain. This 
paper reports the case of a 60-year-old woman suffering from Riedel's struma and 
discusses differential diagnostic aspects with regard to preoperative 
investigation and pathohistology."
3289612,"The base cleavage specificity of angiogenin toward naturally occurring 
polyribonucleotides has been determined by using rapid RNA sequencing 
technology. With 5S RNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, 
angiogenin cleaves phosphodiester bonds exclusively at cytidylic or uridylic 
residues, preferably when the pyrimidines are followed by adenine. However, not 
all of the existent pyrimidine bonds in the 5S RNAs are cleaved, likely owing to 
elements of structure in the substrate. Despite the high degree of sequence 
homology between angiogenin and ribonuclease A (RNase A), which includes all 
three catalytic as well as substrate binding residues, the cleavage patterns 
with natural RNAs are unique to each enzyme. Angiogenin significantly hydrolyzes 
certain bonds that are not appreciably attacked by RNase A and vice versa. The 
different cleavage specificities of angiogenin and RNase A may account for the 
fact that the former is angiogenic while the latter is not."
3292449,"The amniotic band syndrome (ABS) refers to the infrequent occurrence of 
congenital deformities presumably due to fetal entanglement in strands of 
ruptured amniotic sac. The most commonly associated anomalies include 
amputations, constriction bands, syndactyly, craniofacial defects, club feet, 
and cleft lip. We present a typical case and short literature review of ABS. The 
infant reported also had a connective tissue nevus and a cutaneous striated 
muscle hamartoma."
3298298,"Diabetes mellitus is a multifaceted disease which intervenes in the personal 
lives of those afflicted in many different ways. In this study prescription drug 
use among diabetics was analyzed in order to shed light on the characteristics 
of diabetic morbidity. Prescription drug use among diabetics and non-diabetics 
in a total population of 21,000 inhabitants in a defined geographic area were 
studied. The diabetic population was categorized according to the type of 
treatment received: insulin treatment, oral anti-diabetic treatment or dietary 
treatment or dietary treatment only. The pattern of prescription drug use 
differed between diabetics and non-diabetics and important differences were 
observed also between diabetics according to type of treatment. Drug use among 
those treated with insulin and those treated orally was substantially higher 
than among non-diabetics while the difference between diabetics on dietary 
regimen and non-diabetics was much smaller. All three treatment groups had 
considerably higher consumption of cardiovascular drugs than non-diabetics. 
Additional findings include more frequent antibiotic use among diabetics treated 
orally and on diet only than among non-diabetics. The use of these drugs was 
also common among insulin treated diabetics but did not differ significantly 
from among non-diabetics. Use of psychotropics was more common among diabetics 
treated with insulin and orally than among non-diabetics."
3299107,"U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of 
messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase 
II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are 
transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it 
was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene 
includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many 
RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show 
that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217, 
including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed 
in Xenopus laevis oocytes, suggesting the presence of a distant control element. 
DNase I footprinting of the 5' flanking region of the U6 gene shows protection 
of the octanucleotide sequence. Moreover, the 5' flanking sequence from -217 to 
-315 can replace the enhancer of a human U2 RNA gene. We therefore conclude that 
although U6 RNA genes appear to be transcribed by pol III, they are preceeded by 
an enhancer-like element which can functionally substitute for the enhancer of a 
pol II-transcribed U RNA gene."
3300731,"The mechanisms of the responses of an enzyme to different hormones and 
metabolites or several enzymes to a single hormone are surprisingly varied. 
There is neither an operon for lipogenic enzymes nor a common step at which 
hormones and metabolites coordinately regulate the expression of lipogenic 
genes. In bacteria, coordinated expression of several enzymes in a single 
metabolic pathway often is achieved by organizing the genes into operons. An 
operon is a group of genes linked together in a linear fashion and producing a 
polycistronic mRNA. Trans-acting factors regulate the transcription of these 
genes by interacting with promoter/regulatory sequences in the 5'-flanking 
region of the most 5'-ward of the genes. In vertebrate animals, however, 
coordinated control of gene transcription is not achieved by linking the 
individual genes, but by putting in the 5'-flanking regions of these genes a 
regulatory sequence that interacts with common trans-acting factors. Genes 
controlled by different hormones are expected to have regulatory elements for 
each hormone. The presence of glucocorticoid and cyclic AMP regulatory elements 
at the 5'-end of the PEPCK gene is consistent with this notion. Transcription is 
not the only step at which hormones and metabolites control the pathways for 
gene expression. The levels of the mRNAs for L-PK, ME, S11, and S14 are 
increased by T3 at post-transcriptional steps. Glucagon also regulates the 
accumulation of ME mRNA post-transcriptionally. Neither the mechanism nor the 
sequence organization of regulatory elements is known for post-transcriptional 
control of gene expression. In the case of PEPCK and HMG-CoA reductase, the next 
steps will be to determine more precisely the sequences in the 5'-region that 
mediate hormone sensitivity and feedback inhibition, respectively, and whether 
trans-acting factors are involved. For the other genes discussed, identification 
of the regulated step must precede identification of sequences that confer 
hormone or metabolite-sensitive regulation on a specific gene. In general, it is 
probable that the hybrid gene approach, so successful for PEPCK and HMG-CoA 
reductase, also will be effective in defining cis-acting hormone- or 
metabolite-regulatory elements in other genes. These techniques should be 
applicable to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our 
long-term objective is to understand the molecular basis of each event that 
intervenes between the binding of hormone or metabolite to its appropriate 
receptor and altered enzyme level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
3301898,"A review of the English literature on Blount disease (osteochondrosis deformans 
tibiae; tibia vara) revealed that two forms of the disease, infantile and 
adolescent, are recognized. The cause of Blount disease is probably 
multifactorial. Most recent evidence on the pathogenesis implicates mechanical 
factors. The diagnosis can be difficult in very young children and must be based 
on history, physical examination, and radiographic findings. A proximal tibial 
metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle of greater than 11 degrees should be observed 
carefully for the development of Blount disease. Both nonoperative and operative 
treatment has been used successfully."
3303067,"The literature in most European languages was consulted for guidelines regarding 
the drug treatment of psychiatrically disturbed pregnant or lactating women. The 
available information allows only a few conclusions. Lithium exposure during the 
first trimester seems to increase the risk of congenital heart disease, 
especially Ebstein's anomaly. As there is still insufficient evidence to prove 
the safeness of other psychoactive drugs for the fetus, caution seems warranted 
here too. A causal link between pharmacotherapy of the mother-to-be and 
malformation of the baby is difficult to prove. But toxic and withdrawal 
symptoms in infants born to women treated regularly until shortly before 
confinement are well documented for most psychoactive drugs."
3310493,"Thyroxine dehalogenation by rat pancreatic islets was studied incubating 
isolated islets with labelled T4. [125I]T4 added to the incubation medium was 
deiodinated by the islets with the consequent production of T3, rT3 and iodide. 
This deiodination process showed a clear glucose-dependence, being significantly 
increased in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. The existence of high and low 
affinity binding sites for T3 was also demonstrated incubating [125I]T3 with 
islets under different experimental conditions. The properties of these binding 
sites were greatly influenced by the extracellular concentration of glucose. 
Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin 
release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the 
medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 
2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited 
the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. Our results 
suggest that thyroid hormones might play a direct regulatory effect on insulin 
secretion, probably mediated by its deiodination and interaction with specific 
receptors in the islet cell."
3311578,"The pathogenesis of hair loss, the postulated mechanisms of minoxidil action on 
hair growth, and clinical trials, adverse reactions, experimental formulations, 
and percutaneous absorption of topical minoxidil preparations are reviewed. 
Topical minoxidil seems to normalize hair follicles and increase blood flow to 
the scalp. In clinical trials of various formulations, results have varied. 
Improved hair growth occurred after four to six months of therapy; twice-daily 
application seems to be indicated. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions are mild scalp dryness and irritation and, rarely, allergic contact 
dermatitis. Current recommendations are to reserve topical minoxidil for 
patients with normal cardiovascular status and to routinely monitor blood 
pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiographic changes. A new drug application 
is pending with FDA for use of topical minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia 
(male-pattern baldness), which is genetically determined and apparently 
stimulated by androgens. For alopecia areata, which involves hair loss on the 
body or scalp, usually patchy and of sudden onset, no reliable treatment has 
been found, although minoxidil may be efficacious in some patients. Minoxidil 
has generated new interest in hair-loss research. The etiology of hair loss must 
be better understood before more effective treatment regimens can be designed."
3314666,"The Kaufman-McKusick syndrome (MK 23670) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by the triad of hydrometrocolpos, postaxial polydactyly, and 
congenital heart disease. Multiple other anomalies have been ascribed to this 
syndrome. Hydrometrocolpos, especially if unrecognized, may be a serious, 
life-threatening condition in the newborn girl. Forty-four cases have been so 
far reported in the literature. A great phenotypic variability occurs in this 
syndrome, therefore making it very difficult to identify the disorder at its 
presentation and classify it correctly. We shall hereafter review current data 
regarding the prominent clinical features, the diagnosis and treatment of this 
syndrome. Problems in genetic counseling will be discussed."
3320045,"A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc 
cells and named papilin. Affinity purified antibodies against this protein 
localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies 
cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be 
the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, 
papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and 
the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was 
formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 
4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the 
proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine 
hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms 
oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 
225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding 
thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 
22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and 
glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g 
of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are 
about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached 
to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin 
is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of 
sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This 
proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding 
proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila 
basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved 
evolutionarily."
3332004,"Molecular and cell biologic studies of a large number of lung cancer cell lines 
of all histologic types have revealed several mechanisms active in the 
pathogenesis of these cells. Small cell lung cancer (also called ""oat cell"" lung 
cancer) has a deletion involving chromosome region 3p(14-23) that is confirmed 
by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis (studies done in 
collaboration with Dr. Susan Naylor). Several lung cancers of both small cell 
and non-small cell type (including adeno- and squamous cell lung cancer) express 
the proto-oncogenes c-, N-, or L-myc, and in some cases more than one of these 
family members. N-myc appears restricted in its expression to the small cell 
lung cancer type while c-myc and L-myc can be expressed in both small cell and 
non-small cell lung cancers. Many lung cancers of all histologic types also 
express large amounts of p53, which are not correlated with the amount or type 
of myc gene product expressed. In small cell lung cancer, high levels of myc 
gene expression are usually associated with gene amplification, and not 
uncommonly there is rearrangement of some of the amplified copies. In non-small 
cell lung cancer, expression without amplification or rearrangement of myc genes 
is seen. In contrast, high level expression of p53 is not associated with gene 
amplification in any lung cancer type. In addition, to these proto-oncogenes 
acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras 
family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf 
Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and 
few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells 
can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion. 
The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also 
called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell 
lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies 
results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse 
xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular 
oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these 
observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in 
patients."
3334897,"In a patient suffering from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD)--a 
disorder of phagocytesuperoxide generation--and McLeod syndrome, characterized 
by the absence of the red cell Kell antigen, we identified a deletion of the 
entire X-CGD gene by means of DNA hybridization with a cDNA probe. Our findings 
suggest that the X-CGD and McLeod loci are physically close in the p21 region of 
the X chromosome proximal to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus."
3336176,"In a 16-week randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of topical 
tretinoin in the treatment of photoaging, all patients applied topical tretinoin 
to one forearm and vehicle cream to the other. Half of the patients received 
tretinoin to the face, and half received vehicle cream. All 30 patients who 
completed the study showed statistically significant improvement in photoaging 
on the tretinoin-treated forearms, but not on the vehicle-treated forearms. 
Fourteen of the 15 patients who received tretinoin to the face had improvement 
in photoaging, whereas none of the vehicle-treated patients' faces improved, a 
statistically significant difference in response between the two groups. 
Statistically significant histologic changes were seen in forearm skin treated 
with tretinoin, but not with vehicle cream. Side effects were limited to 
irritation of tretinoin-exposed skin."
3336362,"Synthesis of the serotype H3 (SerH3) surface antigen is temperature dependent 
and responds within 1 h to a change in incubation conditions (G.A. Bannon, R. 
Perkins-Dameron, and A. Allen-Nash, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:3240-3245, 1986). 
Recently, a Tetrahymena thermophila cDNA clone (pC6; D.W. Martindale and P.J. 
Bruns, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:1857-1865, 1983) has been shown to be homologous to a 
portion of the SerH3 mRNA (F.P. Doerder and R.L. Hallberg, personal 
communication), and it was shown that the cellular levels of this RNA rapidly 
decreased when cells were shifted from 30 to 41 degrees C (R.L. Hallberg, K.W. 
Kraus, and R.C. Findly, Mol. Cell. Biol. 4:2170-2179, 1984). These observations 
indicate that synthesis of the SerH3 protein is highly regulated in response to 
temperature and led us to initiate studies to determine the mechanism(s) by 
which SerH3 gene expression is controlled. Using pC6 as a hybridization probe 
for the SerH3 mRNA, we have determined that (i) the level of SerH3 protein 
synthesis is directly correlated with the amount of SerH3 message available for 
translation; (ii) there is, at most, a twofold difference between the relative 
transcription rates of SerH3 genes at 30 and 40 degrees C; (iii) the SerH3 mRNA 
half-life in cells incubated at 30 degrees C is greater than 1 h, whereas the 
half-life in cells incubated at 40 degrees C is only approximately 3 min. These 
results demonstrate that Tetrahymena SerH3 surface protein expression is 
regulated by mRNA abundance. Furthermore, the major mechanism controlling mRNA 
abundance is a dramatic temperature-dependent change in SerH3 mRNA stability."
3338422,"""Hot water epilepsy"" (HWE), precipitated by a bath or shower in hot water, has 
been described infrequently in the literature. We report 279 cases of HWE that 
were seen between 1980 to 1983 in Bangalore, South India. We found HWE to be 
more common in children, with cases more frequent among male than female 
patients (2.6:1). Complex partial seizures constituted the main clinical 
presentation (67.0%); HWE accounted for 4.4% of all complex partial seizures and 
generalize tonic-clonic seizures seen at our center during the 1980-1983 period. 
Although prognosis seems favorable 25.4% of our patients developed nonreflex 
epilepsy within 1-3 years. They were managed with antiepileptic drugs and the 
use of lukewarm water for bathing."
3339667,"Refinements in injury scaling of blunt trauma and expansion to include 
penetrating injuries have resulted in the publication of the 1985 revision of 
the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). To simplify use of this scale for Injury 
Severity Scoring in clinical practice, two 8 1/2"" x 11"" charts, which can be 
included in the patient record, have been developed from the AIS dictionary. 
Separate charts apply to blunt and penetrating trauma. Previous experience with 
a condensed AIS chart (CAIS) using the 1980 revision of the dictionary suggests 
that such edited revisions can result in accurate injury scaling in more than 
95% of patients presenting to a Level I Trauma Center. The availability of such 
charts assists in calculation of the ISS soon after admission, which may prove 
to be a valuable teaching tool and useful in resource allocation, audit, and 
assessment for prospective payment."
3347367,"Systemic administration of naloxone usually produces either hyperalgesia or no 
change in nociception depending on the animal species used and/or the pain test 
employed. This study, however, demonstrates that naloxone produces a 
dose-dependent analgesia in the formalin pain test using an inbred strain of 
albino mouse. Female BALB/c, C57BL/6 and CD1 mice were injected subcutaneously 
with naloxone HCl in saline (0.1 10.0 mg/kg) or saline alone, and tested for 
analgesia using the formalin test. Naloxone produced a statistically significant 
dose-dependent analgesia in the BALB/c mice, with an ED50 of 0.24 mg/kg and 
almost total analgesia at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. No changes in pain 
behaviour were observed in the C57BL/6 or CD1 strains of mice. We believe this 
to be the first report of analgesia following administration of doses of 
naloxone normally used for opioid antagonism. To determine if this effect was 
specific to the formalin test, the 3 strains of mice were injected 
subcutaneously with naloxone HCl and tested in the tail-flick test. Naloxone had 
no analgesic action in this test in any of the strains."
3351015,"Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an unusual dermatologic condition with a 
characteristic clinical appearance and a clear association with diabetes 
mellitus. There is currently no treatment that reverses the atrophic changes 
associated with this lesion. We have carried out a clinicopathologic study on 15 
subjects and, in addition, have reviewed 10 further biopsy specimens of 
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. We found a frequent association of 
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with other chronic complications of diabetes 
mellitus, including limited joint mobility. It is possible that nonenzymatic 
glucosylation or other changes in collagen may be important in the etiology of 
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and the limited joint mobility. We confirmed 
that cutaneous anesthesia is usually present in the necrobiosis lipoidica 
diabeticorum lesions. With the use of an antibody to S100 protein and an 
immunohistochemical method, there was an apparent decreased number of nerves in 
the skin lesions. We suggest that sensory loss results from local destruction of 
cutaneous nerves by the inflammatory process. Finally, in six elliptical 
biopsies extending into clinically normal skin, we demonstrated that the 
inflammatory infiltrate of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum extended from the 
lesion into apparently normal skin surrounding clinically active lesions. Thus, 
intradermal steroids might be administered to perilesional areas surrounding 
active lesions in the hope of halting progression."
3354620,"The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder with 
pleiotropic manifestations affecting skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular 
systems. Because the fibrillar collagens are major structural components of 
connective tissue, the hypothesis has long been set forth that the Marfan 
syndrome is a disorder of fibrillar collagen. We have investigated this 
hypothesis by performing linkage studies in 12 multiplex families with the 
Marfan syndrome, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) 
associated with 3 genes encoding chains of fibrillar collagens. The data exclude 
linkage to all 3 candidate genes in 2 families and at least 1 of the candidates 
is excluded in 6 additional families. Each candidate was excluded in at least 3 
families. In no case was strong evidence in favor of linkage of the Marfan 
syndrome to any of the 3 genes observed. These data speak against the hypothesis 
that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic 
Marfan syndrome."
3356808,"Using a variety of neuroanatomical and histological techniques, we compare the 
spinal cord and peripheral nerve distribution in the tails of larvae from 
Xenopus laevis and three species of Rana. The relatively large, postsacral 
spinal cord of Xenopus contains abundant motoneurons and their axons. Spinal 
nerves exit from the spinal cord in a regular array, one nerve per myotome, from 
the cervical region to near the end of the tail. Somata of motoneurons 
innervating caudal myotomes are found along the entire length of the tail. In 
contrast, the caudal cord of Rana is reduced to a filum terminale consisting of 
little more than an ependymal tube; spinal nerves to all caudal myotomes leave 
the cord in the sacral region and reach their motor targets via a cauda equina 
and caudal plexus. Motoneuron cell bodies innervating caudal myotomes are found 
only in the sacral region. The Rana larval pattern is similar to that of adult 
frogs and mammals, whereas the Xenopus larval pattern is more like that of 
salamanders and reptiles. These gross neuroanatomical differences are not due to 
differences in the size or developmental stage of the tadpoles, but instead are 
associated with differences in the swimming behavior of the larvae. The presence 
of motoneurons in the caudal spinal cord of Xenopus may provide local 
intermyotomal control within the tail; the elongated topography of the cord 
appears to permit finer, rostral-to-caudal regulation of neuromuscular activity. 
The Rana spinal cord, on the other hand--with motoneurons clustered 
anteriorly--may produce concurrent firing of adjacent ipsilateral myotomes, but 
at the expense of fine intermyotomal regulation. The fact that nerves in the 
tail of Xenopus enter and exit from the spinal cord locally, as opposed to far 
anteriorly as in Rana, means that for tadpoles of the same size, reflex arc 
lengths are many times shorter in Xenopus."
3357886,"A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962 
explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different 
bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The 
theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is 
not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine 
content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral 
parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA 
sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of 
neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined 
parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants 
were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all 
organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers 
plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine 
content among different parts of the vertebrate genome."
3359672,"This report presents the first example of male transmission of Apert 
acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome. Female transmission has been reported in the 
five previous well-documented cases of dominant inheritance of the syndrome."
3359982,"It has been reported that oligodendrocytes do not contain nuclear T3 receptors, 
which is in apparent contradiction with the well-known effects of thyroid 
hormones on myelination. In this study we have reexamined the presence of 
receptors in this cell population, using pure rat oligodendrocyte cultures. T3 
binding was also studied with the use of pure rat astrocytes as well as in mixed 
neuronal-glial cultures. The latter are mainly neuronal during the first days in 
culture and essentially glial thereafter. Binding studies carried out in intact 
cells demonstrated the presence of high affinity-low capacity binding sites for 
thyroid hormones in pure cultures of oligodendrocytes. The maximal binding 
capacity was 50-60 fmol/100 micrograms DNA and the dissociation constant (Kd) 
0.13 nM. Pure rat astrocyte cultures also contained high affinity sites for 
thyroid hormones, although receptor concentrations was 2-3 times lower than in 
oligodendrocytes or neurons. This was confirmed in pure cultures of chick 
astrocytes and in neuronal-glial cultures during the astroglial period. The 
relative affinity of the receptor for thyroid hormone analogs was 
triiodothyroacetic acid = T3 greater than T4 greater than tetraiodothyroacetic 
acid in oligodendrocyte and astrocyte nuclei, and the sedimentation coefficient 
of the receptor was approximately 3.8S in both cell types. These results 
demonstrate that nuclear T3 receptors similar to those found in neurons and 
astrocytes are also present in oligodendrocytes. This suggests that the effects 
of thyroid hormones on myelination could result from a direct action of the 
hormone in the oligodendrocytes."
3361958,"Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal 
paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women. To date, 28 
patients with at least two of these individually unusual or rare neoplasms have 
been described. This updated case report of one of the originally described 
patients with Carney's triad highlights several clinically important features of 
this unusual syndrome: (1) the multicentricity of both the paragangliomas and 
the epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, (2) the often indolent progression of 
metastatic leiomyosarcoma, (3) the potential for late recurrences, and (4) the 
importance of distinguishing intra-adrenal from periadrenal 
catecholamine-producing tumors (paragangliomas). Localization of paragangliomas 
is facilitated by two relatively new techniques--131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine 
scanning (a scintigraphic technique with high specificity for 
catecholamine-producing tumors) and two-dimensional echocardiography (which can 
noninvasively localize and demonstrate the anatomic relationships of 
aorticopulmonary paragangliomas). In patients with this syndrome, new or 
recurrent tumors frequently manifest after unusually long asymptomatic 
intervals. We outline an approach for continued follow-up of patients with one 
or more of the three neoplasms that constitute the syndrome. Rigorous long-term 
screening of these patients should not only lead to early recognition and 
resection of recurrent or new tumors but also enhance our understanding of this 
intriguing syndrome."
3362213,"Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from 
mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, 
beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (ref. 1). A relatively high frequency of carriers 
(1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the disease is found in the Ashkenazi 
Jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a 
founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of 
heterozygotes. We have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of 
the HEXA gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, the substitution of 
a C for G in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in 
defective splicing of the messenger RNA. A test for the mutant allele based on 
amplification of DNA by the 'polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a DdeI 
restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other 
cases of the Ashkenazi, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are heterozygous for 
two different mutations. The occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants 
further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis."
3408089,"Central retinal-artery obstruction (CRAO) is a devastating complication after 
retrobulbar anesthesia, a procedure which was previously recommended routinely 
to immobilize the eye and reduce discomfort during laser surgery. Recent 
developments in treatment technique, involving scatter laser applications given 
over several sessions with smaller spot sizes and shorter durations, have 
virtually eliminated the need for retrobulbar injections and the risks of 
retrobulbar hemorrhage, which can cause increased intraocular pressure and 
culminate in closure of the arterial circulation. We present the case of a 
patient with proliferative sickle retinopathy who sustained such a complication 
after direct photocoagulation treatment of sea-fans elsewhere and offer 
alternative treatment techniques which we have used for the past ten years that 
eliminate this hazard."
3423165,"This study tested the hypothesis that the Type A behavior pattern and its 
components are associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous 
system. To do this, we employed two new markers of sympathetic tone--pupil size 
and platelet catecholamine content. Thirty-three healthy males were blindly 
rated for Type A behavior and verbal stylistic components by Structured 
Interview. Adrenergic tone to the pupils was assessed from pupil diameter 
recorded by infrared television pupillometry, and pupil alpha-adrenergic 
sensitivity was estimated from mydriatic response to ophthalmic phenylephrine. 
Platelet epinephrine and norepinephrine contents were assayed because these 
levels are associated with chronic, long-term circulating catecholamine levels. 
The results showed Type As had consistently larger pupil diameters than Type Bs 
(p = 0.03, 0.03, and 0.01). There was no difference in pupillary response to 
phenylephrine instillation between groups. Platelet epinephrine content was 
greater in Type A subjects (chi 2 = 4.25, p less than 0.04, t = 1.6, p = 0.06). 
Only the component of explosiveness was modestly associated with resting pupil 
size, and no components significantly predicted platelet catecholamines. We 
conclude that the results of these two new markers of autonomic activity, 
namely, pupil size and platelet epinephrine, suggest that Type A behavior is 
characterized by increased sympathetic nervous system tone although we cannot 
rule out the possibility of decreased activity of the parasympathetic nervous 
system."
3425403,"Human hand anlagen of different developmental stages are studied light and 
scanning electron microscopically. The findings are compared with experimental 
and ultrastructural results obtained from avian limb anlagen. Shaping, cell 
differentiation and the spatial arrangement of different cells are found to be 
the basic processes of hand development. The shaping of the arm and hand seems 
to anticipate future grasping movements. Factors controlling this developmental 
process are on the one hand the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) that maintains in 
the underlying mesoderm a high level of mitotic activity, and on the other hand 
a species-specific pattern of cell death in different zones of arm and hand. 
Interdigital cell death, microfilament bundles included in the basal compartment 
of AER cells, and local anchorings of the AER ectoderm by collagen fibrils are 
involved in finger separation. The flexion creases are genetically fixed and 
their development cannot be explained by mechanical factors. It is found that 
the early hand anlage is already composed of relatively autonomous founder cells 
committed to different lineages. This is true for the muscle precursor cells 
which originate from the brachial somites. These migrating somite cells are 
determined to belong to the myogenic lineage. However, their distribution, 
mitotic activity and later arrangement in single muscles are controlled by 
factors localized within the hand itself. Tendons develop autonomously from 
somatopleural cells. Other already committed cells are the angioblasts forming 
the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, the neural crest cells 
differentiating into melanocytes and Schwann cells, and the blood-derived cells 
like chrondro- or osteoclasts. The differentiation of somatopleural cells into 
cartilage, connective tissue or smooth muscle depends on their position within 
the hand anlage. Possible mechanisms leading to the specific pattern are 
discussed."
3425783,"The literature is divided as to the necessity of an intact posterior cruciate 
ligament for functional stability. Presented here is a prospective study of 
isolated posterior cruciate injuries seen in the acute stage in 13 patients, 6 
males and 7 females. The diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament tear was made 
clinically and confirmed by arthroscopy. The average age at injury was 22 years. 
The athletic activity at injury was varied. Hyperflexion was the most common 
mechanism of injury, followed by pretibial trauma in the hyperflexed knee or in 
the ""dashboard"" injury. There were seven complete midsubstance tears and five 
partial tears. Direct visualization of the posterior cruciate ligament was not 
attained in one patient. All patients were treated nonoperatively on a 
physiotherapy routine. Average followup was 2.6 years. Patients were clinically 
examined and subjected to KT-1000 and Cybex testing. All patients were able to 
return to their previous activity and experienced no limitations with their 
injured knees. Using Hughston's criteria, subjective and functional ratings were 
all good. However, only 3 rated good and 10 fair when assessed objectively. We 
conclude that acceptable functional stability in these patients does not 
necessarily require absolute static stability. Nonoperative treatment of the 
isolated posterior cruciate ligament midsubstance injury may be a viable 
alternative to the difficult repair/reconstruction procedure."
3435068,"The response to continuous intravenous infusion of levodopa was evaluated in 23 
patients with Parkinson's disease complicated by motor fluctuations. Conversion 
from oral to intravenous levodopa treatment resulted in an immediate and 
sustained stabilization of plasma levodopa levels in both the wearing-off and 
on-off groups. Motor variability also diminished within the first 24 hours of 
infusion, although to a much greater extent in patients with the wearing-off 
phenomenon. Over the next 5 to 11 days of intravenous treatment, further 
reductions in motor fluctuations occurred in both groups, at a substantially 
faster rate in the wearing-off group than in the on-off group. The degree of 
immediate stabilization of parkinsonian motor response correlated best with 
disease duration, whereas the rate of subsequent improvement correlated most 
closely with levodopa dose. The results support the view that the wearing-off 
phenomenon may reflect the degeneration of dopamine terminals as a consequence 
of natural disease progression with a resultant inability to buffer variations 
in levodopa availability; the on-off phenomenon may reflect additional 
postsynaptic changes, possibly occurring in response to the nonphysiological 
fluctuations in synaptic dopamine, which gradually remit during continuous 
levodopa administration."
3454289,"Clues to evolution of the genetic code can be found by comparing usage of 
anticodons in various organisms and organelles. GC content of DNA varies, as a 
result of directional mutation pressure (AT/GC pressure), especially in 
bacteria. Low GC in Mycoplasma is accompanied by use of UGA for tryptophan and, 
in ciliated protozoa, by use of UAA and UAG for glutamine. These are examples of 
""stop codon capture,"" which has been preceded by duplication of tRNA genes 
followed by nucleotide substitutions in their sequences, including mutational 
changes in their anticodons. Evolutionary changes in the code may have resulted 
from disappearance of codons and anticodons resulting from GC pressure and from 
their reappearance when the direction of the pressure was reversed. In this 
manner, codon UGA and anticodon UCA for tryptophan could have disappeared under 
GC pressure and reappeared in Mycoplasma under AT pressure. Stop codon UGA may 
have been the third of the three stop codons to appear, originating from 
mutations in UAA. Changes in the code are adaptive and nondeleterious. We 
propose that the number of anticodons has increased and that evolution continued 
until three existing forms of the universal code were produced: eukaryotic, 
eubacterial, and the code for halobacteria and methanococci. These three codes 
are distinguished from each other by their anticodon pattern. The eukaryotic 
code contains eight INN (ANN) anticodons that have replaced GNN anticodons as a 
result of AT pressure. Mitochondrial and chloroplast codes have evolved from the 
eubacterial code through genomic economization and AT pressure, leading to 
losses of GNN and CNN anticodons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3459397,"A phase II multicenter clinical study of epirubicin, a new anthracycline 
anticancer agent, was carried out in 46 patients with advanced breast cancer. 
The treatment schedule consisted of either 60 mg/m2 every three weeks or 40 to 
50 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 every four weeks. Objective responses were observed 
in 23.7% of 38 evaluable patients (1 CR and 8 PR). Response rates according to 
previous chemotherapy were 50.0% (4/8) in previously non-treated patients and 
36.4% (4/11) in patients previously treated with non-anthracyclines. The major 
adverse effect was bone-marrow suppression; leukopenia was observed in 82.1% of 
patients, anemia in 53.8% and thrombocytopenia in 20.0%. Other toxicities 
frequently observed were anorexia (55.0%), nausea-vomiting (55.0%) and alopecia 
(66.7%), but these seemed to be milder than those produced by doxorubicin."
3459732,"Recent clinical observations strongly suggest that isotretinoin [13-cis-retinoic 
acid (cis RA)] is a human teratogen causing primarily heart and craniofacial 
malformations including ear and palatal defects. The purpose of the present 
study was to determine if cis RA could induce similar craniofacial malformations 
in mouse embryo culture. Day 8 CD-1 mouse embryos were cultured for 48 hours in 
rat serum in the presence or absence of various concentrations of cis RA 
dissolved in DMSO. DMSO by itself had no effect on embryonic development; 
however, cis RA at 2 X 10(-5) M (6 micrograms/ml) was clearly toxic. At 2 X 
10(-6) M cis RA, growth retardation was minimal, and approximately one-third of 
the embryos exhibited very specific defects including a dramatic reduction in 
the size of the first and second visceral arches, which eventually give rise to 
the maxilla, mandible, and ear. Similar observations were also made with 
4-oxo-13-cis RA, which is a major metabolite of cis RA in the mouse and human. 
These malformations would be expected to result in defects similar to those 
observed in the human, and preliminary observations suggest these defects are 
due to cis RA-induced inhibition of cranial neural crest cell migration. Using 
day-10 mouse embryos cultured for 48 hours in Waymouth's medium containing 50% 
fetal calf serum, we observed that cis RA at 2 X 10(-5) M produced a high 
percentage of embryos with limb defects and median cleft lip. Our results 
demonstrate that labeled cis RA enters the tissues of the embryo both in vivo 
and in vitro. Cis RA inhibited proliferation of the frontonasal mesenchyme cells 
in primary culture with 31% inhibition occurring at 2 X 10(-5) M cis RA."
3461747,"A new anthracycline analog, epirubicin (4'-epi-Adriamycin) was evaluated at 
eleven institutes in a phase II clinical study in patients with malignant 
lymphoma. Epirubicin was administered intravenously mainly with using the 
following two regimens; 50 to 60 mg/m2 every three weeks and 40 mg/m2 weekly. A 
total of 46 cases were entered into the study and 41 cases were evaluable. 
Clinical responses, complete plus partial remissions, were observed in 27 cases 
(65.9%) with 8 of these showing complete remission. There was no significant 
difference of response between the two regimens. Response rates taking into 
account previous chemotherapy were 90.9% (10/11) in previously nontreated cases, 
61.9% (8/13) in cases previously treated with non-anthracyclines and 52.9% 
(9/17) in cases treated with anthracyclines. The major adverse effect was bone 
marrow suppression; leukopenia was observed in 83.8%, anemia in 60.5% and 
thrombocytopenia in 15.4%. Other adverse effects frequently observed were 
anorexia (59.0%), nausea-vomiting (48.8%) and alopecia (55.6%). These adverse 
effects seemed milder than those produced by doxorubicin. The results indicated 
that epirubicin seemed to be a markedly useful drug against malignant lymphoma."
3462718,"To examine the RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) specificity of RNA 
maturation/utilization and transcriptional enhancement, we constructed a 
chimeric plasmid (pPolI-CAT) in which a promoter for mouse rRNA gene 
transcription was placed adjacent the coding sequences for chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase (CAT; EC 2.3.1.28). A number of other constructs, including 
plasmids also containing a murine sarcoma virus enhancer or lacking any natural 
eukaryotic promoter sequences, were also prepared. In apparent agreement with 
earlier conclusions that an RNA polymerase I transcript can act as a messenger 
RNA, transient transfection of mouse L cells with pPolI-CAT yielded both high 
levels of transcription from the RNA polymerase I promoter and enzymatically 
active CAT protein. However, further examination revealed that CAT protein is 
not translated from RNA that begins at the normal rRNA transcription initiation 
site. Polysomal RNA is devoid of such RNA and instead consists of CAT-encoding 
transcripts that begin elsewhere in the mouse ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. Since 
transcription of these aberrant RNAs is stimulated by the addition of a murine 
sarcoma virus enhancer segment, they are probably transcribed by RNA polymerase 
II. Transcripts that map to the authentic rRNA start site are not similarly 
enhanced. Moreover, unlike the RNAs deriving from the rRNA initiation site, 
these aberrant RNAs are more stable and the level of translatable CAT 
transcripts is suppressed by inclusion of larger segments of the rDNA promoter 
regions. Fortuitously initiated mRNAs are also formed in the absence of any 
natural eukaryotic promoter sequence. From these data we conclude that there is 
no evidence that normal RNA polymerase I transcription yields functional mRNA 
and that transcriptional enhancement appears to be RNA polymerase specific."
3463445,"Acrocentric bivalent associations were studied in 232 human male germ cells at 
pachytene in order to understand better the preferential involvement of 
chromosomes 13, 14, and 21 in Robertsonian translocations. The tendency of each 
acrocentric bivalent to associate with another was not correlated with NOR 
activity, as measured by silver staining. Good agreement was noticed between 
their ability to associate and the amount of satellite DNA in human acrocentric 
chromosomes. The distribution of two-by-two acrocentric bivalent associations 
was random. In order to reconcile this result with the nonrandom distribution of 
Robertsonian translocations, a molecular hypothesis is proposed. The model is 
based on homology of recombinational sites, interspersed at regular interval in 
satellite DNA, which could increase the probability of accidental unequal 
crossing-over between two specific acrocentric chromosomes."
3464952,"The Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromere-linked genes, LYS1 and CYH1 on 
chromosome I and TPS13 and RAN1 on chromosome II, have been isolated. The 
genetic order of these markers with respect to their centromeres was determined 
to establish relative directionality on the genetic and physical maps. 
Chromosome walking toward the centromeres reveals a group of repetitive 
sequences that occur only in the centromere regions of chromosomes I and II and 
at one other specific location in the S. pombe genome, presumably the centromere 
of chromosome III. The major class of large repeated sequence elements is 6.4 
kilobases (kb) long (repeat K), portions of which occur at least twice on 
chromosome II and in several tandemly arranged intact copies at another 
centromeric location. Repeat K in turn contains groups of smaller repeats. 
Genetic recombination is strongly suppressed in the centromere II region, which 
contains at least 30 kb of repeated sequences. Centromeric DNA organization is 
much more complex in fission yeast than has been described in budding yeast 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly because of the larger more condensed nature 
of the S. pombe chromosomes."
3469966,"Records of the emergency medical admissions to a large teaching hospital over a 
one year period were examined for evidence of Wernicke's encephalopathy or 
Korsakoff's syndrome. It was found that only 0.4% of the population studied had 
the classical triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy, namely confusion, 
ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. If two of these three criteria are allowed in the 
absence of other causes then 2.2% of the population had this limited Wernicke's 
encephalopathy or Korsakoff's syndrome. It is concluded that the diagnosis of 
Wernicke's encephalopathy should not rely on the presence of all three criteria; 
any two of the three in the absence of other causes will suffice for the 
diagnosis."
3476895,"Twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of nonorganic burning mouth syndrome were 
matched for age and sex with twenty-five patients with organically based painful 
disorders of the mouth. All patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist and 
completed the General Health Questionnaire to screen for psychiatric disorders. 
A diagnosis of psychiatric disorder based on clinical examination findings was 
made in 44% (11/25) of the patients with burning mouth syndrome and in 16% 
(4/25) of the controls."
3488531,"DeQuervain tenosynovitis, which involves the abductor pollicis longus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendons, is much more common in women than men and is 
due to repetitive movements of the hand such as grasping and twisting. 
Housewives and persons involved in manual occupations using the hands and wrists 
account for most cases in previous series. In this series, six of 24 female 
patients (25%) were pregnant or postpartum at the time of onset. In five of the 
six, activities of infant care aggravated symptoms. Both pregnancy, per se, and 
mechanical factors appear to play a role in causing this condition."
3489839,"During a 10-year period 65 children and adolescents with ambiguous genitalia 
from the Dominican Republic, not known through kindred studies of 5 
alpha-reductase deficiency, were evaluated. Plasma androgen determinations were 
performed before and/or after Leydig cell stimulation of the testes with human 
chorionic gonadotropin. Of the children there were 24 female 
pseudohermaphrodites, 21 of whom had 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 1 true 
hermaphrodite and 40 (62 per cent) male pseudohermaphrodites. One child had a 
human chorionic gonadotropin response suggestive of 17-20 desmolase deficiency, 
and on further evaluation he also had partial deficiencies of the enzymes 
21-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Five subjects had a female phenotype 
and subnormal androgen responses to human chorionic gonadotropin. In 5 of 33 
male pseudohermaphrodites with a normal testosterone response to human chorionic 
gonadotropin 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was suspected by elevated plasma 
testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratios before and/or after human chorionic 
gonadotropin stimulation. The diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was 
confirmed by elevated 5 beta/5 alpha urinary C19 and C21 steroid metabolite 
ratios. One subject with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was traced to the original 
Dominican kindred of 38 affected subjects. Pedigree analysis of another proband 
revealed 3 additional affected relatives. Four subjects with a normal 
testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin had XO/XY gonadal 
dysgenesis. There were 25 male pseudohermaphrodites with normal plasma 
testosterone and dihydrotestosterone responses to human chorionic gonadotropin, 
who were not diagnosed by this methodology. This study reveals that 5 
alpha-reductase deficiency occurs with a frequency of 13 per cent as a cause of 
male pseudohermaphroditism in the Dominican Republic with approximately the same 
frequency as XO/XY gonadal dysgenesis. Unlike female pseudohermaphrodites, the 
majority of male subjects with pseudohermaphroditism remain unclassified by 
these techniques."
3496981,"Many of the common respiratory illnesses of infancy and childhood are caused by 
viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, in particular measles virus, respiratory 
syncytial (RS) virus and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI3). Effective measles 
vaccine was developed by classical methods, but these same methods have failed 
to provide vaccines to control RS and PI3 virus infections. The WHO Programme 
for Vaccine Development was initiated in 1983 to encourage the application of 
the new biotechnologies to continuing problems, such as the acute virus-induced 
respiratory diseases of childhood. At a meeting of research workers held in July 
1986 under the auspices of this programme, renewed optimism was expressed 
concerning the prospects for immunoprophylaxis of RS virus-induced disease. 
Animal models are now available for evaluation of the immunogenic potential of 
candidate vaccines. Vaccinia/RS recombinant viruses have been produced which 
have allowed the immunogenic properties of individual RS virus proteins to be 
defined. Complete protection without the exacerbation of disease, which earlier 
had accompanied the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines, has been achieved in 
animals immunized with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the F protein; 
partial protection was obtained using G protein gene vectors. PI3 appears to be 
an inherently stable virus and evidence from animal experiments suggests that 
bovine PI3 might be suitable for use as a live vaccine in man."
3497271,"Certain DNA binding proteins are thought to organize the mammalian genome into 
distinct 3 dimensional structures, each characteristic of a given differentiated 
state. Autoantibodies to 2 types of DNA binding protein complexes, the nuclear 
lamina and p70/p80 (Ku), were identified in sera of patients with collagen 
vascular diseases. The intranuclear distribution, DNA binding, and behavior 
during mitosis of these antigens were examined using autoimmune sera and murine 
monoclonal antibodies. In vivo, the antigens have different intranuclear 
distributions and solubility characteristics. However, both antigens appear to 
reversibly bind to DNA during interphase and to rapidly dissociate from DNA 
during mitosis. Although the binding affinity of p70/p80 to DNA is 
heterogeneous, the interaction between p70/p80 and DNA in vitro is stable over 2 
h or more. The rapid dissociation of p70/p80 from DNA during mitosis may 
therefore be mediated by a modification in either chromatin structure or in the 
p70/p80 antigen itself. Other proteins that reversibly interact with DNA, such 
as the lamins and nuclear pores, may have a role in the organization of DNA into 
transcribable euchromatin and nontranscribable heterochromatin. Autoantibodies 
to these proteins, and possibly those reactive with p70/p80, or other DNA 
binding proteins may be useful probes for studying both chromatin organization 
and the causes of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus."
3542725,"Sleep-related breathing disorders may contribute to the nocturnal peak in human 
mortality. Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and 
snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors 
for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease."
3548729,"Thirty experimental and fifteen control Wistar rats were studied to determine 
whether hypoglycin A influences insulin levels in the body to contribute to the 
state of hypoglycemia usually observed in Jamaican vomiting sickness, a 
condition arising after ingestion of unripe ackees. This fruit also grows in 
other Caribbean islands, as well as North and Central America. Hypoglycin A is 
one of the toxic compounds found in unripe ackees and is capable of inducing 
hypoglycemia. A fall in blood glucose occurred after administration of 
hypoglycin A. The lowest level of 42.60 +/- 4.84 mg/dl was attained 3 hr after 
administration of the drug. This alteration of blood glucose from the fasting 
level of 80.31 +/- 5.20 mg/dl was significant (P less than 0.01). The blood 
glucose level in the control rats showed no significant change from the fasting 
level. The insulin level in portal and peripheral blood showed no significant 
change. Results showed that, although hypoglycin A induced severe hypoglycemia 
after intravenous application, there was no significant change in insulin 
levels. This observation suggests that hypoglycin A has a mechanism of action 
other than an alteration in insulin levels to induce hypoglycemia."
3548756,"As is the case for the assembly of protein components of the membranes in animal 
mitochondria, the bilayer phospholipids arise from a complicated interplay of 
intra- and extra-mitochondrial reactions. Our early studies indicated that the 
bulk of mitochondrial phospholipids (typified by phosphatidylcholine) had their 
origin in the endoplasmic reticulum and were transported to the mitochondria as 
complexes with phospholipid-exchange proteins. The polyglycerophosphatides 
(typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by 
intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as 
intermediates. The case for the precursors in the latter pathway is less clear, 
although evidence has been presented for dual localization of enzymes for 
glycerophosphate acylation and CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyl transfer in both 
mitochondria and microsomes. Phosphatidylethanolamine also shows evidence for 
two sites of origin: by translocation from its site of synthesis in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and by translocation of phosphatidylserine followed by 
decarboxylation within the mitochondria. In the latter case mitochondrial 
phosphatidylserine decarboxylase may play an important role in the regulation of 
phospholipid metabolism throughout the cell."
3549808,"Eight deaths that occurred during Upjohn-sponsored clinical trials of topical 
minoxidil and two deaths in subjects who used extemporaneous formulations of the 
drug are summarized. Of the eight patients in clinical trials, five had 
cardiovascular abnormalities and two had acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome-related pneumonia. One patient died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had 
hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial 
infarction. There is little likelihood of significant adverse effects 
attributable to topical minoxidil because of its low systemic absorption. The 
evidence suggests that these deaths were the result of causes other than use of 
the drug."
3550721,"Examination of cerebrospinal fluid remains a mainstay of the diagnosis of many 
acute central nervous system illnesses, including meningitis, encephalitis, and 
polyneuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although generally considered 
innocuous, there may be considerable danger when lumbar puncture is performed in 
the presence of increased intracranial pressure, especially when a mass lesion 
is present. We review the literature surrounding the danger of lumbar puncture 
when intracranial pressure is increased and discuss our approach to the problem 
in lieu of the advent of computerized tomographic scanning."
3558369,"Kinetic and catalytic properties of the DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase HhaI 
are described. With poly(dG-dC) as substrate, the reaction proceeds by an 
equilibrium (or processive) ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which DNA binds to the 
enzyme first, followed by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). After methyl transfer, 
S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) dissociates followed by methylated DNA. AdoHcy 
is a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet (Ki = 2.0 microM) and 
its generation during reactions results in non-linear kinetics. AdoMet and 
AdoHcy significantly interact with only the substrate enzyme-DNA complex; they 
do not bind to free enzyme and bind poorly to the methylated enzyme-DNA complex. 
In the absence of AdoMet, HhaI methylase catalyzes exchange of the 5-H of 
substrate cytosines for protons of water at about 7-fold the rate of 
methylation. The 5-H exchange reaction is inhibited by AdoMet or AdoHcy. In the 
enzyme-DNA-AdoHcy complex, AdoHcy also suppresses dissociation of DNA and 
reassociation of the enzyme with other substrate sequences. Our studies reveal 
that the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases involves 
attack of the C6 of substrate cytosines by an enzyme nucleophile and formation 
of a transient covalent adduct. Based on precedents of other enzymes which 
catalyze similar reactions and the susceptibility of HhaI to inactivation by 
N-ethylmaleimide, we propose that the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue is 
the nucleophilic catalyst. Furthermore, we propose that Cys-81 is the 
active-site catalyst in HhaI. This residue is found in a Pro-Cys doublet which 
is conserved in all DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases whose sequences have 
been determined to date and is found in related enzymes. Finally, we discuss the 
possibility that covalent adducts between C6 of pyrimidines and nucleophiles of 
proteins may be important general components of protein-nucleic acid 
interactions."
3560450,"The immunohistological distribution of blood group (BG)-related antigens 
including A, B, H type 2, and sialylated Lex in lung adenocarcinomas was 
examined using monoclonal antibodies. BG-A, B, and H type 2 compatible with the 
ABO status in tumor cells were expressed in 60% of the cases. Accumulation of H 
type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of 
patients with BG status other than 0. Tumor-associated antigens, Lex and 
sialylated Lex were detected in 36.0% and 72.0%, respectively. Modification of 
carbohydrate antigens in cancer may be associated with incomplete synthesis; 
accumulation of precursor antigen; and activated sialylation."
3569694,"The transcapillary escape rate and relative plasma disappearance of glycated and 
non-glycated albumin were measured in 25 male Type 1 (insulin-dependent) 
diabetic patients using a double tracer technique. The patients were divided 
into three groups on the basis of their urinary albumin excretion: group 1, 
normal albumin excretion (less than 30 mg/24 h) (n = 8); group 2, 
microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h) (n = 9); and group 3, clinical nephropathy 
(greater than 300 mg/24 h) (n = 8). Six male age-matched non-diabetic persons 
served as control subjects. The transcapillary escape rate of glycated albumin 
was similar in group 1 and control subjects (4.7 +/- 2.1 versus 5.1 +/- 1.7%), 
but significantly increased in group 2 (7.0 +/- 1.7%, p less than 0.05) and in 
group 3 (7.9 +/- 3.1%, p less than 0.05). The transcapillary escape rate of 
glycated albumin was slightly lower than that of non-glycated albumin in all 
groups, but significant only in normal control subjects. No difference in the 
catabolic rate of glycated and non-glycated albumin was found. We conclude that 
the in vivo effects of glycation on the clearance and transcapillary passage of 
albumin are small and not likely to play any significant role in the development 
of late diabetic microvascular complications."
3574383,"To evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone for treatment of primary 
supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, we studied 93 patients 40 to 80 years 
old, using a double-blind randomized block design. After the subjects were 
stratified according to their level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale), those 
with objectively documented primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage were 
randomly assigned to either dexamethasone or placebo. For ethical reasons, three 
interim analyses were planned, to permit early termination of the trial if one 
study group did better than the other. During the third interim analysis, the 
death rate at the 21st day was identical in the two groups (dexamethasone vs. 
placebo, 21 of 46 vs. 21 of 47; chi-square = 0.01, P = 0.93). In contrast, the 
rate of complications (mostly infections and complications of diabetes) was much 
higher in the dexamethasone group (chi-square = 10.89, P less than 0.001), 
leading to early termination of the study. In the light of the absence of a 
demonstrable beneficial effect and the presence of a significant harmful effect, 
current practices of using dexamethasone for treatment of primary supratentorial 
hemorrhage should be reconsidered."
3579222,"The contribution of the peripheral and central pharmacokinetic mechanisms of 
levodopa to the pathogenesis of the motor fluctuations that complicate its 
long-term administration was studied in 28 parkinsonian patients. The rate of 
levodopa clearance from the general circulation, its plasma half-life, and 
apparent volume of distribution were indistinguishable between patients with the 
on-off or the wearing-off phenomenon and those with a stable response to 
levodopa or those who had not been previously treated with levodopa. Peripheral 
pharmacokinetic factors are thus unlikely to account for the development of 
these response fluctuations. Conversely, the efficacy half-time of levodopa 
differed markedly among the four response groups studied and may provide a 
quantitative index of central mechanisms that favor the development of the 
wearing-off and on-off phenomena. Although symptom duration was the best 
predictor of the severity of untreated parkinsonism, levodopa dose correlated 
best with response half-time. The wearing-off phenomenon may primarily reflect 
the loss of buffering capacity caused by degeneration of the dopamine neurons, 
while the development of the on-off phenomenon appears to require additional 
postsynaptic changes, possibly at the receptor level."
3579687,"We report a case of Listeria rhombencephalitis in a previously healthy 
60-year-old man. Listeria rhombencephalitis is a rare but well-defined clinical 
syndrome of lower brain-stem involvement caused by Listeria monocytogenes. 
Contrary to other listerioses, rhombencephalitis has been mainly observed in 
patients without predisposing conditions. In our case, however, findings of a 
detailed immunologic study, performed three months and one year, respectively, 
after clinical onset of Listeria rhombencephalitis manifestations, showed a 
transient cellular immunity defect, not associated with any other apparent 
disease."
3582603,"Per cent stimulation of GR activity by FAD in vitro and PNP oxidase activity 
were measured in G6PD deficiency, heterozygous beta-thalassaemia and controls. 
It is confirmed that, in contrast to the high stimulation of GR by FAD commonly 
found in in thalassaemia indicating red-cell deficiency of FAD, and shown here 
to be greater in the Italian subjects, GR is usually saturated with FAD in G6PD 
deficiency, leading to high in vitro activity. Unexpectedly, on the other hand, 
low FMN-dependent PNP oxidase activity due to red-cell deficiency of FMN, 
confirmed by response to oral riboflavin, was found in the majority of subjects 
with G6PD deficiency, similar to that found in heterozygous beta-thalassaemia. 
Whereas this is explained in thalassaemia by an inherited slow red-cell 
metabolism of riboflavin to FMN, it is suggested that in G6PD deficiency an 
increased rate of red-cell metabolism of FMN to FAD leads to the low FMN and 
high FAD. When G6PD deficiency occurs with heterozygous beta-thalassaemia, GR is 
usually saturated with FAD as in G6PD deficiency alone, unless there is an 
inherited, very slow red-cell metabolism of riboflavin to FMN. The part played 
by GR in haemolytic crises in G6PD deficiency is discussed."
3585172,"Minigel methodology has been utilized for apolipoprotein (apo) E isoform 
phenotyping and criteria for distinguishing the apoE4/4 phenotype (mean 
apoE4/apoE3 ratio: 5.81) from the apoE4/3 phenotype (mean ratio: 1.01) and the 
apoE3/3 phenotype (mean apoE3/apoE2 ratio: 2.67) from the apoE3/2 phenotype 
(mean ratio: 0.76) based on gel scanning were developed. ApoE allele frequencies 
in 1209 subjects were: apoE3, 0.786; apoE4, 0.135; apoE2, 0.075; apoE5, 0.002; 
and apoE1, 0.002. Subjects with the apoE2 allele tended to have higher plasma 
very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and lower low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations than subjects with the apoE3 
allele, while the converse was true for subjects with the apoE4 allele. Subjects 
with the rare apoE1 allele had values similar to those with the apoE2 allele, 
while subjects with the rare apoE5 allele had values similar to those with the 
apoE4 allele."
3585870,"The Q-tip test was applied on 105 patients. Fifty-one had stress urinary 
incontinency (SUI), 28 had bladder instability by clinical and urodynamic 
criteria, and 36 had mild or moderate pelvic relaxation without urinary 
pathology. More than 90% of the patients with SUI and no previous surgery had a 
positive Q-tip test, with 90% test sensitivity in this group. More than 
one-third of the patients with bladder instability and almost one-half of the 
patients with pelvic relaxation and no urinary incontinence had a positive Q-tip 
test, for low test specificity. The Q-tip test is a simple clinical tool for 
diagnosing pelvic relaxation, which at times leads to SUI. Almost all patients 
with primary SUI have pelvic relaxation. The Q-tip test alone does not stand as 
a diagnostic test. When it is positive, the diagnosis of genuine stress 
incontinence is possible although not absolute. A negative test should cause one 
to question the diagnosis of genuine stress incontinence, and sophisticated and 
more expensive tests should be ordered before establishing a final diagnosis."
3595535,"We have examined the influence of assay conditions on the 
6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) sensitivity of the iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase in 
brown adipose tissue (BAT) from hypothyroid rats. These results were compared 
with similar studies of 5'-deiodinase activity in kidney microsomes from 
euthyroid animals. Even though BAT microsomes contain largely type II 
(PTU-insensitive) deiodinase activity, the 5'-deiodination of T4 can be 
inhibited by PTU if the dithiothreitol (DTT) concentration in the assay is 
reduced to 5 mM or less. The apparent Ki for PTU of BAT microsomes was 4.3 mM at 
5.0 mM DTT and 0.41 mM at 0.5 mM DTT. The kinetics of inhibition were 
noncompetitive. With kidney microsomes, PTU inhibition of rT3 5'-deiodination 
was both time and enzyme/substrate ratio dependent. For example, using 1 
microgram microsomal protein, 2 nM rT3, and 5 mM DTT, the inhibitory effect of 
PTU was not maximal until 12 min after PTU addition. At stable reaction 
velocities PTU inhibition was uncompetitive, and the Ki was about 1 microM. 
Deiodination by kidney microsomes was completely inhibited by 50 microM PTU. 
Even though it is possible to inhibit the type II 5'-deiodinase activity with 
high concentrations of PTU (in the presence of low DTT concentrations), the 
deiodinase in kidney is about 1000-fold more sensitive to PTU. By these criteria 
the kidney microsome 5'-deiodinase is type I."
3601096,"Transthyretin is an important choroid plexus-specific transport protein that has 
been reported to be both elevated and decreased in the CSF of multiple sclerosis 
patients. We report that CSF transthyretin levels are not altered in MS, 
indicating that choroid plexus function with respect to this protein is 
unaffected in this disease."
3604881,"Psychosomatic elements, behavior, and sympathetic overactivity are presumed to 
underlie many cardiovascular diseases; the most investigated conditions are 
borderline hypertension and type A/B behavior. Many patients with borderline 
hypertension show signs of hyperkinetic circulation, that is, elevated heart 
rate and cardiac index. This elevation is neurogenic, since it can be abolished 
with a combination of beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade. Response to 
such stepwise blockade shows a larger beta-adrenergic and a lower 
parasympathetic change in cardiac tone, characteristic of the functional 
organization of the medullary integrative centers of cardiovascular control. The 
most likely cause for this abnormal integration is psychosomatic. These patients 
may be expected to respond to treatment with behavioral and/or cardioselective 
beta-adrenergic blocking agents. There is little doubt that type A behavior is a 
predictor of coronary heart disease. The description of the pathophysiology of 
these transient but characteristically excessive cardiovascular episodes is 
difficult, however. Type A individuals do not always hyperreact in the same way; 
the response can be limited to heart rate, blood pressure, or occasionally 
exaggerated urinary or plasma catecholamine responses. In our laboratory we 
concentrated on steady markers of type A behavior. Type A subjects had 
reproducibly larger pupil size--indicative of increased sympathetic 
arousal--higher heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, and significantly 
elevated platelet epinephrine values when challenged by a mental task. Treatment 
with behavioral methods, beta-blocking agents, or both might be useful for 
prevention of coronary heart disease in type A individuals."
3612209,"The syndrome of ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia, or Miller-Fisher 
syndrome, has been considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome with 
pathology restricted to the peripheral nervous system. A patient with 
Miller-Fisher syndrome and bilateral demyelinating optic neuropathy suggesting 
associated central nervous system pathology is presented. Clinical and 
experimental evidence regarding the association of central and peripheral 
nervous system demyelination is reviewed."
3614758,"The results are reported of a systematic research conducted on 684 patients 
subjected to radiological examinations for the purpose of identifying the three 
pathologies that constitute Saint's triad in an attempt to contribute to the 
assessment of its real incidence. The investigation revealed 7 cases of Saint's 
triad (1.02%) and 86 cases of bifocal associations; 59 cholelithiasis + 
diverticulosis, 17 cholelithiasis + Hiatus hernia; 10 diverticulosis + hernia. 
The incidence of the triad was 4 times higher than expected as was revealed by a 
simple statistical calculation."
3618059,"The carpal tunnel syndrome is the most frequent entrapment syndrome of 
peripheral nerves. Either a diminution of the volume of the whole carpal tunnel 
or increasement of the intracarpal structures can enhance the pressure on the 
median nerve and so develop a carpal tunnel syndrome. Fibrosis or thickening of 
the synovia of the wrist joint is the most common cause of the syndrome, that 
appears usually in women more than 50 years old. Irradiating pain and sensory 
disturbances are the most frequent subjective complaints. Motoric changes appear 
in a minority of patients with the syndrome. The operative procedure is done 
ambulatory with brachial plexus anesthesia. The subcutaneous 'ramus palmaris 
nervi mediani' should be treated carefully when releasing the transverse 
ligament. After a mean time of 24.1 months, 28 of carpal tunnel syndromes 
treated operatively had a significant amelioration. Seven patients had recurrent 
sensible or motoric complaints, one of them was operated on a second time. 
Postoperative recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome mostly is due to inadequate 
technique or fibrous proliferations."
3619689,"82 cases of streptococcal infection (SI) in children who died in 1977-1985 are 
studied. Higher incidence of SI in children particularly in those who died at 
home is emphasized. As a rule, the proper diagnosis was not established 
clinically. By manifestations the observations were divided into two groups: 1) 
SI with a pronounced generalization including a pharyngeal one (31 cases), 4 of 
them with a rash (scarlet fever); extrapharyngeal (7 cases), 6 of them with a 
rash (scarlet fever); 2) SI without pronounced generalization (localized) 
including 33 cases with the involvement of the lungs and tonsilla and having an 
ordinary course and 11 cases of a sudden death. SI structural manifestations 
involved development of necrotic or purulent-necrotic inflammation of a various 
degree in the area of the primary focus, regional lymph nodes as well as in the 
foci resulting from lymphohaematogenic and intracanalicular dissemination. The 
first symptoms of the septic process could be found even in case of death during 
the first day of the disease. The role of viral respiratory infection being the 
background for the SI development, especially for its pharyngeal variant and 
lung affection, is shown. The significance of thymomegaly and adrenal hypoplasia 
in the development of a sudden death is revealed."
3625236,"The de Morsier syndrome, or septo-optic dysplasia, is a developmental anomaly 
characterized by involvement of the optic system, hypothalamic-pituitary axis 
and septum pellucidum. Only a few anatomical observations are recorded. We 
report three new cases and review the pertinent literature. The 
neuropathological lesions varied as did the clinical features. The hypothalamic 
nuclei were most commonly involved, followed by the optic system and the septum 
pellucidum. Other lesions were found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, 
olfactory system and cerebellum. The hypopituitarism appeared to have been 
secondary to hypothalamic damage rather than to intrinsic pituitary defect. A 
virtually normal histology and the usual endocrine cell populations were 
demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in the adenohypophysis. Damage to the 
neurophysin-containing cells of the hypothalamus explains the various degrees of 
clinically observed diabetes insipidus."
3625764,"The proposition that finger print variability between individuals might be 
reduced by the absence of an X-chromosome in Turner's syndrome was rejected. In 
the present study of 58 XO patients, aged 15-50 years, relatives of several 
cases, unrelated female control samples and three unrelated male samples were 
investigated. The higher mean value of the TRC among patients supported the 
hypothesis forwarded by Penrose that an added X- or Y-chromosome reduces the TRC 
and a missing one increasing it. The figures do not speak against the hypothesis 
that genes affecting the TRC are located on the X-chromosome. A summary of the 
major dermatoglyphic investigations in Turner's syndrome is presented."
3627450,"Motor axons supplying lumbrical muscles are less severely affected than axons 
supplying thenar muscles in the carpal tunnel syndrome; sometimes lumbrical 
motor fibers are less affected than digit 2 sensory fibers. This pattern is 
consistent with compression of both the anterior and posterior aspects of the 
median nerve in the carpal tunnel because nerve fibers responsible for thenar, 
lumbrical, and digit 2 functions lie in an anterior-posterior gradient within 
the distal median nerve. Recognition of lumbrical sparing supports the 
electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome when the distal latency to thenar 
muscles or the palm-to-wrist mixed median nerve conduction velocity is normal."
3627621,"Autoerythrocyte sensitization (Gardner-Diamond syndrome) causes painful 
ecchymoses, and usually occurs in young women. It is rare and of unknown 
etiology. The young woman in this report probably had the condition beginning at 
age 14, but the diagnosis was not made until age 19, shortly after a 
copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) exacerbated her condition. The 
ecchymoses disappeared when the IUD was removed, but recurred when replaced. A 
non-copper IUD caused no ecchymoses. Taping a copper penny to the skin caused a 
similar rash. It seems that in this woman, the Gardner-Diamond syndrome was 
markedly worsened by exposure to copper."
3670047,"DNAs from 253 fresh human tumors of 38 different types were hybridized with 17 
different oncogene probes. The analysis demonstrated unique associations between 
amplification of specific oncogenes and specific types of tumors. In a large 
number of cases it was determined that amplified oncogenes occurred in 10 to 20% 
of tumors with the following specific associations: c-myc in adenocarcinomas, 
squamous carcinomas and sarcomas but not hematologic malignancies; c-erbB2 in 
adenocarcinomas, particularly breast cancers; c-erbB1 in squamous carcinomas; 
N-myc in neuroblastomas. A small number of cases suggested other specific 
associations: amplified c-myb in breast cancers; amplified c-ras-Ha and c-ras-Ki 
in ovarian carcinomas. In addition, there was a correlation between 
amplification of c-myc and the clinical stage of adenocarcinomas, and 
amplification of c-erbB2 and the clinical stage and lymph node involvement of 
breast cancers."
3670297,"The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on 
chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be 
intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. Because factors controlling 
normal bcr expression might also be involved in the expression of this aberrant 
bcr-abl transcript, we studied the patterns of expression of the normal bcr gene 
in different cell types. We found that the normal bcr gene was expressed in many 
different types of human cells. Moreover, the bcr gene was evolutionarily 
conserved, and homologous bcr genomic sequences and RNA transcripts were readily 
detected in chick tissue. The highest level of bcr expression in chick tissue 
was in brain tissue, the lowest level was in liver tissue, and a truncated bcr 
mRNA was noted in chick testes. Normal bcr transcripts, in addition to the 
aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts, have been found in all Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive CML cells studied to date. Within a given CML sample, the 
relative amounts of normal bcr RNA and aberrant bcr-abl RNA were similar. In 
addition, the normal bcr and the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts 
demonstrated similarly prolonged half-lives compared with that of the normal 
abl-related transcripts in CML cells. These findings suggest that in CML cells, 
similar cellular mechanisms control the steady-state levels of both the normal 
bcr and the bcr-abl fusion RNAs."
3680580,"The aim of these two studies was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 
oral nalmefene, a new orally effective opioid antagonist. In the first study, 
single ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg of nalmefene HCl were 
administered in double-blind fashion to four groups of healthy men. There were 
six subjects in each group; four received nalmefene and two received placebo. 
The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side 
effects, such as lightheadedness, at the higher doses. Model-independent 
pharmacokinetic analysis of the plasma concentration-time data showed that 
nalmefene was rapidly absorbed and had an elimination half-life that ranged from 
seven to 15 hours (mean, 10.7 hr). There was a good linear relationship (r = 
.97) between administered dose and total area under the curve at each dose 
level. Only about 4% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged 
nalmefene, whereas up to 60% was excreted as a beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase 
hydrolysable conjugate(s) of nalmefene. In the second study, six healthy men 
were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were 
obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours. A dosing schedule of 20 mg 
q12h was then started and continued for seven days. Plasma samples were 
collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours 
after the last dose. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no 
clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day 
administration period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3701378,"A young adult male is described with muscular dystrophy of probable X-linked 
recessive inheritance. An onset of muscle weakness in late adolescence was 
preceded by contractures of the neck and elbows dating back to childhood. The 
distribution of muscle weakness was proximal in the upper limbs and both 
proximal and distal in the lower. The mixed pattern of muscle involvement in the 
legs favours the view that cases of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with 
proximal weakness in both the upper and lower limbs and X-linked scapuloperoneal 
muscular dystrophy represent the same disorder. A muscle biopsy in the present 
case showed unique appearances."
3704568,"Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor 
function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients 
with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind 
cross-over design. Frequency and incontinence episodes decreased significantly, 
while first sensation and cystometric bladder capacity increased. Both 
objectively and subjectively terodiline was significantly better than placebo 
with 50% (95% confidence limits 18-82) more patients improved on terodiline than 
on placebo. Thirty percent of the patients (95% confidence limits 12-54) 
relapsed after withdrawal of terodiline. At 3 months follow-up the remaining 70% 
were satisfied with the outcome of the training programme. Side effects were 
mild and reversible. Serum creatinine and alkaline phosphatase increased 
slightly on terodiline and the diastolic blood pressure was probably also 
increased by terodiline. In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge 
incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female 
patients with urge incontinence and proven instability."
3707599,"3,5-Dimethyl-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine (DIMIT) and 
3,5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyroacetic acid (IpTA2), two thyroid hormone analogs, 
have been tested in genetically obese Zucker rats and their lean littermates, in 
comparison with thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) for their thyromimetic 
activities on body weight gain and lipid levels in serum and liver. The 
compounds were administered for 9 weeks by orogastric tube to 6- to 8-week-old 
animals. While body weight gain remained practically unchanged in the lean rats, 
it decreased significantly in the obese individuals, especially with IpTA2. The 
serum lipid concentrations were also decreased in the obese rats in comparison 
with their lean littermates, especially with DIMIT. The connection observed 
between the structure of DIMIT and IpTA2 on one hand and their effects on the 
other is in good agreement with previous studies. Our results confirm that the 
iodine substituents are not necessary for thyromimetic activity and demonstrate 
that the isopropyl substituent in 3' plays an important role in the serum 
lipid-lowering effect of the thyroid hormone analogs tested."
3714053,"We describe nine patients with fat malabsorption in whom a spectrum of vitamin E 
deficiency was present. Early deficiency was generally asymptomatic, and 
intermediate deficiency produced some impairment. Ataxia, weakness, reflex 
changes, impaired vision, and pigment retinopathy were associated with chronic, 
advanced deficiency. In the last group, delayed central somatosensory conduction 
and amplitude reduction of the electroretinogram were present. In adults, a 
severe vitamin E deficiency state existed for more than 5 years before producing 
measurable neurologic damage. The clinical picture is less homogeneous than 
previously suggested, and electrophysiologic abnormalities need not predate 
clinical dysfunction."
3718705,"Participation of microsomal CDP-diglycerides in mitochondrial biosynthesis of 
phosphatidylglycerol was studied by [3H]palmitoyl, [14C]linoleoyl, and 
[14C]arachidonoyl CDP-diglycerides and [3H]CDP-diglycerides which were bound to 
microsomal membranes, incubated with unlabelled mitochondrial membranes, and 
further incubated in the presence of radioactive sn-glycero-3-phosphate under 
conditions required for mitochondrial phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. Ten to 
15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial 
membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as 
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl 
CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin)."
3721910,"An X chromosome specific nucleic acid probe was used to study the positions of 
the X chromosomes in leukocyte nuclei by in situ hybridization to smears of

3722679,"It is well known that the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency 
can occur in the absence of anemia. The authors recently observed two elderly 
patients who presented to a chronic care institution with the diagnosis of 
dementia, and in both individuals low serum B12 levels were found in conjunction 
with abnormal Schilling tests. In neither of these two patients was there anemia 
or macrocytosis. After receiving parenteral B12 injections there was improvement 
noted in cognitive functions as well as in activities of daily living. The 
authors are reporting these patients to alert clinicians to the fact that 
pernicious anemia in the elderly can first present with low serum B12 levels and 
neurologic abnormalities in the absence of anemia or macrocytosis."
3729752,"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: 
early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow 
progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and 
X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a 
similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. 
We postulate separate genetic disorders with similar phenotypic expression."
3730367,"Phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated 
by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, 
and by an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of 
which remains to be defined. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize 
the latter kinase, called phospholamban kinase. Phospholamban kinase was 
purified approximately 42-fold with a yield of 11%. The purified fraction 
exhibits a specific activity of 6.5 nmol of phosphate incorporated into 
exogenous phospholamban per minute per milligram of protein. Phospholamban 
kinase appears to be a high molecular weight enzyme and presents a broad 
substrate specificity, synapsin-1, glycogen synthase, and smooth muscle myosin 
regulatory light chain being the best substrates. Phospholamban kinase 
phosphorylates synapsin-1 on a Mr 30 000 peptide. The enzyme exhibits an optimum 
pH of 8.6, a Km for ATP of 9 microM, and a requirement for Mg2+ ions. These data 
suggest that phospholamban kinase might be an isoenzyme of the multifunctional 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Consequently we have searched for Mr 
50 000-60 000 phosphorylatable subunits among cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum 
proteins. A Mr 56 000 protein was found to be phosphorylated in the presence of 
Ca2+/calmodulin. Such phosphorylation alters the electrophoretic migration 
velocity of the protein. In addition, this protein that binds calmodulin was 
always found to be present in fractions containing phospholamban kinase 
activity. This Mr 56 000 protein is therefore a good candidate for being a 
subunit of phospholamban kinase. However, the Mr 56 000 calmodulin-binding 
protein and the Mr 53 000 intrinsic glycoprotein which binds ATP are two 
distinct entities."
3730832,"Thyroid hormones influence the expression of transmitter-specific enzymes by 
central cholinergic neurons. Based on the fact that these cholinergic neurons 
degenerate selectively in human Alzheimer's disease, it was hypothesized that 
thyroid hormones might be beneficial in its treatment. However, since thyroid 
hormones influence the function of most peripheral organs, derivatives selective 
for central cholinergic neurons are necessary. The structural requirements of 
the receptor mediating the effects of the thyroid hormones on central 
cholinergic neurons were therefore compared with those of the receptors 
mediating actions on peripheral organs. Cultures were prepared of dissociated 
neurons from the septal area of fetal rat brains, and the differentiation of 
cholinergic neurons was assessed by measuring the activity of choline 
acetyltransferase (ChAT). Triiodothyronine (T3) was found to stimulate ChAT 
activity in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of T3 was additive to that of 
nerve growth factor. The potency of derivatives of T3 in elevating ChAT activity 
in the cultures was compared with their known anti-goiter activity determined in 
vivo and their binding affinity to the hepatic nuclear receptor measured in 
vitro. The findings indicate that the structural requirements of central and 
peripheral receptors are similar and that it therefore appears unlikely that 
analogs of thyroid hormones can be developed which selectively affect 
cholinergic neurons."
3736130,"The basic genetic defect in the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria), 
a premature aging syndrome, is unknown. To investigate possible defects in 
hyaluronic acid (HA) metabolism in this disease, the urinary excretion of HA was 
studied. Urine specimens from 11 patients with this disorder were examined for 
HA by a novel high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. In 
patients with progeria, HA excretion ranged from 169 micrograms HA/g creatinine 
to 1440 micrograms HA/g creatinine. In normal age-matched controls, HA excreted 
ranged from 0 to 77 micrograms HA/g creatinine. In all, a mean 17-fold increase 
in HA excretion was observed in patients with progeria when compared with 
age-matched normal controls. Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion was not 
elevated. Amongst normal controls, a modest age-related increase in HA excretion 
was observed. These results suggest that urinary HA levels are abnormally 
elevated in progeria."
3736772,"Calcification in the stroma of adult telencephalic choroid plexus was studied of 
20 postmortem brains and one biopsy by light microscopy, transmission and 
scanning electron microscopy and compared with calcification in psammoma bodies 
in normal arachnoid, five spinal meningiomas and in calcospherites of six pineal 
glands. Fifteen fetal and newborn choroid plexuses were also examined by light 
microscopy. Calcium deposition was observed in the subepithelial regions of the 
adult choroid plexus, in the walls of blood vessels but was mostly seen in 
spherical psammoma bodies. Collagen whorls 20-60 microns in diameter and 
surrounded by arachnoid cells, were observed in the stroma of the choroid 
plexus; calcium, phosphorous and iron were deposited in the collagen whorls to 
form psammoma bodies. Matrix vesicles and spicules resembling hydroxyapatite 
were associated with the arachnoid cells surrounding the collagen whorls and 
with the collagen fibres within the whorls. The dense amorphous calcified core 
of each psammoma body was surrounded by an outer coating of entwined collagen 
fibres readily visible by scanning electron microscopy. Similar psammoma bodies 
were occasionally observed in normal arachnoid. Psammoma bodies in meningiomas 
resembled those in the choroid plexus stroma. Calcospherites in the pineal 
differed from psammoma bodies; they were lobulated, more irregular in shape and 
did not have a collagen base. The results of this study suggest that psammoma 
bodies in the choroid plexus, as in meningiomas, form by a process of dystrophic 
calcification associated with arachnoid cells and collagen fibres. The presence 
of iron in the choroid plexus psammoma bodies may be a result of haemorrhage 
into the stroma. The mechanism of calcification in pineal remains unclear."
3741499,"Twenty-nine patients participated in a prospective study of the safety and 
efficacy of oral methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid 
arthritis. Patients received a mean dosage of 12.4 mg weekly over a mean 
duration of 29.1 months. All patients had liver biopsies at baseline, 2 years, 
and annually thereafter. Patients improved significantly by all clinical 
measures of efficacy after 1 month; maximum improvement tended to occur after 
approximately 6 months of therapy. Radiographs showed improvement of erosive 
disease in 7 of 11 patients measured. There was a significant reduction in mean 
prednisone dosage. Four patients required an increase in the dosage of 
methotrexate after prolonged therapy, because of declining clinical response. 
Toxicity was noted at some time in 26 of 29 patients (90%), but reactions 
universally became mild and tolerable after adjustment of the dosage. No 
significant hepatotoxicity was found in 60 sequential liver biopsies, although 
elevated transaminase levels were noted at some time in 20 of 29 patients (70%)."
3742854,"The segregation of brown (type IV) oculocutaneous albinism was analyzed in 18

3752426,"In addition to the typical manifestations of thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura 
like thrombocytopenia, haemolysis, fever, coma and renal failure, signs of a 
beginning DIC could be seen in a patient after abdominal surgery. Haemostatic, 
cardiovascular and respiratory data are presented. Pulmonary angiography by 
using a Swan-Ganz-catheter revealed multiple filling defects reversible with 
therapy. Treatment with fresh whole blood aggravated thrombocytopenia. Daily 
infusions of fresh frozen plasma combined with heparinisation and antithrombin 
III because of DIC, induced haematologic remission. Renal failure and cerebral 
symptoms could not be influenced. Diagnosis, monitoring and therapy are 
discussed."
3756504,"Nuclear T3 receptor (NTR) have been characterized in separated cultures of 
neurons and astrocytes. Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of a single 
class of high-affinity sites in both cell lines. The apparent equilibrium 
association constant ranged from 1.80 +/- 0.41 X 10(10) M-1 to 3.27 +/- 0.74 +/- 
10(10) M-1 in neurons and from 1.01 +/- 0.09 to 1.80 +/- 0.73 X 10(10) M-1 in 
astrocytes depending on the time in culture. In neurons, the maximal binding 
capacity (MBC) increased from 0.049 +/- 0.008 ng T3/mg DNA to 0.328 +/- 0.052 ng 
T3/mg DNA between 3 and 12 days of culture. In astrocytes, the changes in MBC 
were less pronounced ranging from a minimum of 0.095 +/- 0.024 ng T3/mg DNA at 
the 7th day of culture to a maximum of 0.198 +/- 0.048 ng T3/mg DNA at the 21st 
day. The relative binding affinity of the receptor for thyroid hormone analogs 
was in the order TRIAC greater than L-T3 greater than D-T3 greater than L-T4 in 
both cell lines. These results show that nuclear T3 receptors similar to those 
found in vivo are present in primary cultures of both astrocytes and neurons."
3758628,"Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in 
one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed 
incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) 
a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the 
Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder 
training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation 
period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the 
patients. Cure was achieved on a long-term basis in 76%. Failure of conservative 
therapy was due especially to severe neurogenic bladder disorders, followed by 
urethral obstructive insufficiency that cannot be influenced. The superimposed 
psychic cause of urge incontinence that should not be underestimated and often 
presents as a transference of unresolved emotional needs (51% of our group are 
psychologically unstable), is discussed. With these facts in mind, our therapy 
concept is translated into reality. Hospitalisation brings about a change in 
surroundings, making the supervision of bladder training and adjustment to 
medication easier, thus supplying the basis for patient compliance and success 
of follow-up therapy subsequent to hospitalisation and discharge from hospital."
3760036,"The histogenesis of Ewing sarcoma, the second most frequent bone tumor in 
humans, remains controversial. Four Ewing cell lines were analyzed by 
immunological methods. A panel of antibodies directed to T, B, and 
myelomonocytic markers gave negative results. Surface antigens recognized on 
Ewing cells were found to be related to the neuroectoderm lineage. Ganglioside 
GD2, a marker of neuroectodermal tissues and tumors, was present on all lines. 
These were also stained by the mouse monoclonal antibody HNK-1, which detects a 
carbohydrate epitope present on several glycoconjugates of the nervous system, 
including two glycoproteins, the myelin-associated glycoprotein and the neural 
cell-adhesion molecule (N-CAM), and an acidic glycolipid of the peripheral 
nervous system. The P61 monoclonal antibody, which reacts with a peptide moiety 
of N-CAM, and a rabbit antiserum, raised to purified mouse N-CAM and not 
recognizing the HNK-1-defined epitope, were also reactive. By contrast, all 
antibodies specific for hematopoietic cell surface antigens were totally 
negative. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are 
characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in 
neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary 
related origin. The recent finding that the human N-CAM gene is located at the 
vicinity of the breakpoint on chromosome 11 indicates that it might be involved 
in genetic rearrangements occurring in this region."
3804022,"Twenty one children with dermatitis herpetiformis were studied in an attempt to 
evaluate the response in the skin, in jejunal morphology, and in jejunal 
immunoglobulin containing cell counts to gluten elimination and subsequent 
gluten challenge. In all of the 15 patients whose jejunal biopsy was studied 
after the eventual gluten challenge the jejunal lesion had returned in 2.4 to 28 
months. The numbers of IgA- and IgM-containing cells were similarly raised in 
primary and postchallenge biopsies. In the 13 patients whose skin improved 
during a gluten free diet and who were challenged with gluten the rash worsened 
and the dapsone/sulphapyridine requirement increased. The jejunal deterioration 
was equally marked in the six patients whose gluten challenge was stopped 
because of an intractable rash as it was in those who completed the preplanned 
challenge. The specimens of the former, however, had significantly more 
IgA-containing cells than specimens of the latter. The number of intraepithelial 
lymphocytes clearly reflected the degree of intestinal damage. IgA-containing 
cells proved to be the most sensitive indicator of an immune reaction taking 
place in the gut of these patients. Even in the two children with initially 
normal or nearly normal jejunal mucosa, the IgA cell counts in the jejunal 
lamina propria were markedly raised."
3806684,"The spinal cord of two tetraodontiform fishes, the Japanese file fish (Navodon 
modestus) and the panther puffer (Takifugu pardalis), are unusual among 
vertebrates in having a markedly abbreviated spinal cord with a long and 
flattened filum terminale. Only the rostral short part of the cord of both 
species is cylindrical; the greater part of the cord is markedly flat. The 
majority of the spinal nerve roots leave the short cylindrical part. The 
flattened part of the cord contains the central canal, myelinated nerve fibers, 
and a few motoneurons surrounding the cauda equina, and it is histologically 
similar to the filum terminale of amphibians and mammals. The spinal cords of 
other teleosts, the sun-fish and angler, also are abbreviated and possess a 
filum terminale and cauda equina. These orders possess an enormous head and 
short trunk. However, the correlation between this body form and an abbreviated 
cord is not causal, since the tetraodontiform species described here show 
ordinary body proportions. The spinal cord may be abbreviated in tetraodontiform 
fishes in general."
3810219,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is transmitted as an 
X-linked recessive disorder, and thus female infants are expected to be only 
rarely affected. Review of the records of 1,478 jaundiced newborn infants (728 
boys and 750 girls) screened for G6PD deficiency at the Foothills Provincial 
Hospital in Calgary showed 41 (5.6%) boys and 17 (2.2%) girls with this 
disorder. In view of the unexpected and unexplained high frequency of G6PD 
deficiency in female infants, I recommend that screening for this disorder be 
done in selected jaundiced infants regardless of sex."

3819049,"A 55-year-old white man born in Canada presented with all the clinical features 
of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex. He showed the characteristic 
violaceous erythema and scaling of the nose and face, the aural helices, and the 
palmoplantar regions with severe nail dystrophy. Extensive examinations failed 
to reveal any associated malignancy up to 5 months after the onset of the skin 
eruption. While the skin was improving, and although the patient was still 
asymptomatic except for a weight loss of 5 kg, evidence of metastatic squamous 
cell carcinoma of the cervical region was obtained. Only palliative treatment 
could be undertaken. The bizarre clinical aspects of the syndrome are reviewed."
3819235,"To evaluate the effect on longevity of a diet that is concurrent with common 
dietary guidelines, a simple diet scoring system was developed and applied in a 
follow-up study of 2,820 middle-aged Dutch civil servants and their spouses. In 
the early 1950s those civil servants were seen for a health examination that 
included a dietary survey. Consumption frequency data of the quantitatively most 
important food items at that time were used for the diet scoring. Overall 
survival after 25 years was 46.8% among men and 68.6% among women. In men, a 
significant positive association between prudent diet score and 25-year, 
age-adjusted survival could be demonstrated. Of the 10 food items that 
constituted the diet score, a higher intake of brown bread, porridge and/or 
yogurt, vegetables, fish, and fruit was associated with a slightly better 
survival. In a separate analysis we had found a significant inverse relationship 
between coffee consumption and survival. A similar trend, which, however, was 
not significant, was observed for alcohol intake. In women, the results for the 
separate food items were inconsistent, and no effect of a prudent diet score on 
longevity was observed. The proposed diet scoring system provides a means for 
evaluating the effects of the individual's food choice behavior on subsequent 
health and longevity."
3826875,"Crib-biting in horses is a repetitive behavior pattern which may involve the 
activation of both narcotic receptors and dopamine receptors in the CNS. 
Crib-biting frequency, determined in 7 nontreated horses under controlled 
conditions, was usually linear for many hours and ranged from 0.3 to 14.9 
bites/min. Intravenous or IM injections of narcotic antagonists decreased these 
rates to almost zero by about 20 minutes after the injection was given. The 
duration of the response to a single injection ranged from 20 minutes for 
naloxone to 4 hours or more for nalmefene and diprenorphine. Effective doses 
were 0.02 to 0.04 mg of naloxone/kg, 0.04 mg of naltrexone/kg, 0.08 mg of 
nalmefene/kg, and 0.02 to 0.03 mg of diprenorphine/kg. Crib-biting could be 
prevented completely for up to a week by continuous infusion of 5 to 10 mg of 
nalmefene/hr. Crib-biting resumed when the infusion was discontinued, and plasma 
nalmefene concentrations decreased to below 5 ng/ml. Doses of nalmefene as large 
as 0.4 mg/kg, IV, produced only minor side effects. These side effects included 
some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and 
mild sedation. Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained 
their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden. Sedation wore off 
during the course of prolonged infusions. Narcotic antagonists may provide a 
novel and effective treatment of stereotypic behavior disorders."
3827356,"Carney's Triad comprises a triad of neoplasms: gastric stromal tumor, 
extra-adrenal paraganglioma (usually functional), and pulmonary chondroma. At 
least two of these are needed for the presumptive diagnosis of the Triad. This 
report presents a patient who had resected a gastric tumor and nonfunctional 
extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The gastric tumor resembled a gastric 
leiomyosarcoma by light microscopy, but electron microscopy revealed it to be a 
gastric autonomic nerve (GAN) tumor. Based on this evidence it appears that both 
the gastric lesions and the paragangliomata of Carney's Triad are tumors of the 
autonomic nervous system. Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic 
nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple 
hamartoma syndrome."

3850773,"The use of insulin by diabetics has largely removed the threat of death from 
ketotic coma but cardiovascular dysfunction remains a major cause of death in 
patients with diabetes. Recent research has indicated a generalized membrane 
defect, which may cause abnormalities of calcium metabolism in nerves, cardiac 
and smooth muscle as well as endothelial cells and thus may lead respectively to 
the development of neuropathy, primary cardiomyopathy, microangiopathy and 
atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes, 
which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with 
others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the 
sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have 
been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump 
failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane 
defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in 
diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the 
metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular 
calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic 
cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to 
understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac 
dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of 
clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular 
problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic 
population."
3855899,"Complaints of enamel defects in American Indian children residing on the St. 
Regis reservation in New York State prompted an epidemiological study. The 
results of that study, reported earlier (Rebich et al., 1983), indicated that 
over one-fifth of the American Indian children had discoloration of the 
dentition due to ingestion of tetracycline during the years of tooth formation. 
These data also provided an ideal opportunity to examine the link between 
tetracycline staining and caries which has been postulated by previous authors. 
American Indian children, ages 7-18, were found to have a higher caries 
experience than other children and a lower rate of dental service utilization, 
as evidenced by the filled component of the DMFS index (FS/DMFS). Within the 
American Indian population, however, no indication was found of any association 
between tetracycline staining and dental caries."
3860809,"On the basis of sequence homology a model is proposed for five structural and 
functional domains in viroids. These domains include (i) a conserved central 
region capable of forming two alternative structures that may regulate two 
phases of the viroid replication cycle, (ii) a region associated with 
pathogenicity, (iii) a domain with high sequence variability, (iv and v) two 
terminal domains that are interchangeable between viroids. That the evolution of 
viroids has involved RNA rearrangements of domains is supported by the partial 
duplication of coconut cadang cadang viroid, which arises de novo during each 
infection. Similar RNA rearrangements have been established for animal viral 
defective interfering RNAs, which arise by some form of discontinuous 
transcription. This mechanism could account for the origin of viroids and also 
RNA viruses, whereby modules of genetic information may have undergone repeated 
exchange between RNA pathogens and the RNA of their hosts."
3863118,"In order to maximize the mutagenic effectiveness of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in 
mouse stem-cell spermatogonia, advantage was taken of the fact that these cells 
can accumulate mutations from repeated doses given over relatively long time 
periods. Repeated doses (100 mg/kg) of ethylnitrosourea injected 
intraperitoneally into male mice at weekly intervals were found to allow 
adequate survival and fertility with total dosages of 300 and 400 mg/kg. The 
specific-locus mutation frequencies at these dosages were, respectively, 1.8 and 
2.2 times that obtained with the maximal practicable single dose of 250 mg/kg. 
The mutation frequency induced by a 400 mg/kg dosage of ethylnitrosourea is 12 
times the maximal mutation frequency achievable with a single exposure to x-rays 
and 36 times that reported for procarbazine, the most effective chemical mutagen 
previously known for mouse stem-cell spermatogonia. Ethylnitrosourea is already 
the mutagen of choice in deliberate attempts to create mouse models for human 
disease and in any experiments in which a maximal mutation rate is desired. 
Repeated-dose regimens similar to the ones reported here should increase the 
efficiency of such studies."
3871127,"Although adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is a common clinical syndrome, 
adhesive capsulitis in other joints has rarely been reported. Four patients who 
developed adhesive capsulitis of the hip joint after trauma and two patients 
with adhesive capsulitis of the ankle, also precipitated by trauma, are 
described. The diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is easily made during 
arthrography when a joint of low volume and high intracapsular pressure is 
encountered."
3872103,"Thyroid hormone alterations (known as the ""sick-euthyroid syndrome"") are common 
following major surgery, but the time course for appearance and recovery from 
these alterations has not previously been longitudinally studied in a large 
group of surgical patients. The authors prospectively studied 59 patients 
undergoing major surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, pneumonectomy, or 
subtotal colectomy). Compared with preoperative values, the mean serum T4, T3, 
free T3, and TSH concentrations decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) 
following surgery. Serum reverse T3 and T3 resin uptake index increased, while 
free T4 levels remained unchanged. These changes were seen within 6 hours of 
surgery and normalized by 1 week after surgery. Although the serum TSH response 
to TRH was normal before and after surgery in 56 of the 59 patients, the maximal 
TRH-induced increase in serum TSH and the integrated serum TSH response to TRH 
were suppressed in the early perioperative period. This postoperative TSH 
suppression correlated with elevated postoperative plasma dopamine 
concentrations (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05). Three patients with compensated 
primary hypothyroidism were detected in the study and represent the first 
documentation of serial thyroid hormone and TSH levels in hypothyroid patients 
undergoing major surgery. These patients had similar changes in thyroid hormone 
values compared with euthyroid patients. The serum TSH response to TRH was 
suppressed into the normal range in two of these patients on the day following 
surgery. The authors conclude that the sick-euthyroid syndrome occurs within a 
few hours of major surgery and remits with convalescence. Postoperative 
decreases in serum TSH may mask the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Surgical 
consultants should be aware of these rapid postoperative changes so that thyroid 
function tests are properly interpreted in patients who have undergone major 
surgery."
3886611,"Risk factor status for cardiovascular disease is affected by life style. 
Adolescence is a time during which long term life-style habits, including 
dietary habits, are established. Physicians who treat adolescent patients have a 
responsibility to be aware of the scientific evidence on the diet-heart question 
so that they can provide their patients with sound dietary advice. The American 
Heart Association has recommended that Americans consume a ""prudent diet"" in 
which daily consumption of cholesterol is no more than 300 mg with up to 30-35% 
of calories derived from fat, and less than 10% of calories derived from 
saturated fat and less than 10% from polyunsaturated fat. This paper reviews 
this recommendation with particular reference to studies of adolescents. This 
review centers around four main issues: 1) the estimated effect on serum 
cholesterol levels of a switch from the usual American diet to the prudent diet; 
2) the effect of a predicted decrease in serum cholesterol on the risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease; 3) evaluation of the evidence of possible 
adverse effects of the prudent diet; 4) feasibility of the prudent diet. Based 
on a review of these four issues, the authors feel that the American Heart 
Association's prudent diet should be strongly recommended for all healthy 
adolescents."
3887409,"The inducible resistance to alkylation mutagenesis and killing in Escherichia 
coli (the adaptive response) is controlled by the ada gene. The Ada protein acts 
both as a positive regulator of the response and as a DNA repair enzyme, 
correcting premutagenic O6-alkylguanine in DNA by suicidal transfer of the alkyl 
group to one of its own cysteine residues. We have determined the DNA sequence 
of the cloned ada+ gene and its regulatory region. The data reveal potential 
sites of ada autoregulation. Amino acid sequence determinations show that the 
active center for the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is located close to 
the polypeptide COOH terminus and has the unusual sequence -Pro-Cys-His-, 
preceded by a very hydrophobic region. These same structural features are 
present at the active site of thymidylate synthase, suggesting a common chemical 
mechanism for activation of the cysteine."
3889351,"Coxsackie B viruses (types 1 to 5) are the most frequent reported cause of acute 
viral myocarditis. To study the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular 
level, we simulated an infectious situation by infecting cultured human foetal 
heart cells with Coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus. Successful replication of this virus 
could be demonstrated by the presence of virus particles inside cultivated 
foetal myocytes together with high titres of progeny virus of 10(8) 
plaque-forming units (PFU) per millilitre culture medium. Within 9 h of 
infection networks of myocytes lost their ability to contract spontaneously 
followed by disintegration and replacement by overgrowing fibroblasts which 
survived the infection. These cells produced CB3 virus continuously over several 
months, indicating carrier state infection of human myocardial fibroblasts. 
Human fibroblasts interferon (IFN-beta) was found to act as a potent inhibitor 
of the replication of this virus. Virus yields could be reduced from 1.2 x 1.8 x 
10(5) PFU/ml culture medium when human heart cells were incubated with IFN-beta 
20 h prior to challenge with a high input multiplicity of 50 PFU of CB3 virus 
per cell, demonstrating the major protective role of IFN-beta in CB3 viral 
infection. It thus appear that IFN-beta might become useful as an antiviral 
agent in the treatment of Coxsackie myocarditis."
3890003,"Exencephaly is a rare precursor of anencephaly in which a large amount of brain 
tissue is present despite the absence of the calvaria. It was discovered 
together with hydramnios in a near-term fetus. Sonographic, angiographic, and 
pathologic findings are discussed."
3891280,"The use of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis is reviewed. Methotrexate, a 
folic acid antagonist, is sometimes employed in an attempt to symptomatically 
control patients whose disease does not respond adequately to conventional 
therapies. Systemic administration of 7.5-15 mg/wk in a ""pulse"" fashion appears 
to be effective without precipitating severe adverse effects. However, concern 
over potentially serious side effects and a lack of well-controlled clinical 
trials have limited its use to severe, refractory disease. Further studies are 
needed before its role in rheumatoid arthritis can justifiably be expanded."
3892050,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy has been found by a number of 
investigators to be effective in the treatment and prevention of superficial 
bladder cancer. While the optimal protocol for bacillus Calmette-Guerin remains 
to be determined, experience with 92 randomized and 30 nonrandomized (high risk) 
patients followed for up to 5 years provides information that may improve future 
protocols. Side effects of bacillus Calmette-Guerin are observed to increase 
with increasing frequency and duration of treatment. The protection from tumor 
recurrence has persisted: only 6 of 30 patients (20 per cent) treated with 
bacillus Calmette-Guerin have had recurrent tumor compared to 14 of 27 controls 
(52 per cent, p equals 0.008, chi-square test), and mean time to recurrence 
increased from 24 to 48 months (p less than 0.005, Savage). Skin test reactivity 
to purified protein derivative is particularly useful in predicting response to 
bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. Currently, 60 patients have been 
randomized to receive bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy and only 1 of 22 
patients (4.5 per cent) in whom the purified protein derivative skin test 
results converted from negative to positive has had recurrent tumor, compared to 
12 recurrences (32 per cent) in patients whose skin tests were positive before 
treatment or failed to convert following treatment (p equals 0.014, chi-square). 
Seven recurrences (33 per cent) developed in 21 patients whose skin tests 
remained negative (p equals 0.015) and 5 recurrences (29 per cent) developed in 
17 patients whose tests previously were positive (p equals 0.068, Fisher's test, 
not significant). The benefit of percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin is 
suggested by the observations that the recurrence rate in patients treated with 
intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin alone is 40 per cent, and all 7 patients 
whose purified protein derivative skin tests were negative continued to have 
negative results when percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin was omitted (p 
equals 0.003). Among high risk patients a marked decrease in or complete 
prevention of recurrent tumor was observed in 82 per cent of 22 patients treated 
previously with chemotherapy and 11 of 14 (78 per cent) with carcinoma in situ 
have had a complete response."
3892051,"We treated 40 patients with superficial bladder cancer via intravesical bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin for 1) prophylaxis against tumor recurrence, 2) residual 
carcinoma or 3) flat carcinoma in situ. A single course of intravesical bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin therapy was successful in 6 of 11 patients (55 per cent) treated 
for residual carcinoma and 6 of 12 (50 per cent) treated for carcinoma in situ. 
Of 17 patients receiving a single course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin for 
prophylaxis 11 remained free of tumor during short-term followup. A second 
course of therapy was administered to failures in each treatment category, which 
resulted in favorable responses in 5 of 6 patients treated for prophylaxis, 2 of 
5 treated for residual tumor and 3 of 6 treated for carcinoma in situ. Over-all 
complete responses were achieved in 16 of 17 patients (94 per cent) treated for 
prophylaxis, 8 of 11 (73 per cent) for residual carcinoma and 8 of 12 (66 per 
cent) for carcinoma in situ, with a mean followup from the final treatment of 
9.3, 12.3 and 7.9 months, respectively. Favorable results occurred more 
frequently among patients who exhibited a granulomatous inflammatory response in 
the bladder and delayed hypersensitivity skin test response to purified protein 
derivative. Marked variability in viability of bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
organisms was observed among different lots of bacillus Calmette-Guerin, and a 
direct relationship was observed between bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine 
viability and therapeutic efficacy. Most patients who failed initial therapy 
with a low viability lot of bacillus Calmette-Guerin responded favorably to 
re-treatment with a higher viability lot. The results suggest that the level of 
viability of each lot of bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine should be verified 
before clinical use."
3939491,"A case control study on the association between maternal epilepsy, 
anticonvulsants use during pregnancy and birth defects was carried out in the 
Italian Multicentric Registry of Birth Defects (IPIMC). In the period 1980-1983, 
7,607 malformed babies out of 439,717 total births (still + live) were 
registered. Fourty-one malformed babies with maternal epilepsy were identified 
(5.39 X 1,000). The overall relative risk of having a malformed baby among 
pregnant epileptic women was 1.87. Spina Bifida, Congenital Heart Defects, 
Clefts, Diaphragmatic Hernia and Trisomy 18 were more frequent than expected 
among babies with maternal epilepsy. The different therapeutic regimens were 
also tested to identify the possible independent teratogenic effect of 
anticonvulsants. A statistically significant association between Spina Bifida 
and Valproic Acid (odds ratio 22.7; Fisher p value = 0.0364) was observed: no 
other anticonvulsant tested showed any association with any type of 
malformation."
3943269,"In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study we evaluated the safety and kinetics 
of a new narcotic antagonist, nalmefene, after 2, 6, 12, and 24 mg intravenous 
doses to healthy men. At each dose level four subjects received active drug and 
two received placebo. The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only 
mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness. 
The plasma concentration-time data were best fit with a triexponential equation, 
and the terminal elimination phase had a harmonic mean t1/2 of 8 to 9 hours. 
Only about 5% of the dose was excreted in the urine as intact nalmefene, with up 
to 60% excreted as nalmefene glucuronide. Although intersubject differences were 
noted, mean or dose-normalized mean kinetic parameters such as clearance, 
steady-state volume of distribution, terminal t1/2, and AUC showed no consistent 
trends related to increasing doses, indicating that nalmefene has linear 
pharmacokinetics."
3947104,"A Phase II clinical trial of a new anthracycline, 
(2''R)-4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (THP), was performed in 137 patients 
with urological malignancies. Out of them, 111 patients were evaluated for tumor 
responses and 125 patients were evaluated for adverse effects. In cases of 
intravenous administration, overall response rate was 18.5% (22.2% for bladder 
cancer, 30.0% for tumors of the renal pelvis and ureter, and 6.7% for prostatic 
cancer). In the case of intra-arterial administration, overall response rate was 
42.9% (50.0% for bladder cancer). For 50 patients with superficial bladder 
cancer intravesical chemotherapy with THP was performed. Sixteen patients showed 
complete disappearance of the tumor, 2 patients showed more than 90% tumor 
regression and 12 patients showed more than 50% tumor regression, respectively. 
Overall response rate was 60%. Cardiotoxicity was minimal. Alopecia was noted in 
a total of 16 patients, but this was minimal. Leukocytopenia was the major 
adverse effect among patients undergoing systemic THP administration. In 
conclusion, THP was most effective against transitional cell carcinoma of the 
urinary tract."
3957897,"The phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of the high molecular weight form of 
phospholamban (24,500 daltons) in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum produced on 
3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation with 5 mM ATP was resolved 
into five clear steps on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and on Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation 
into ten steps. The mobility shift of the low molecular weight form of 
phospholamban (less than 14,400 daltons) in these reactions occurred in one step 
and two steps, respectively. With the two protein kinase activities, the 
electrophoretic pattern of the mobility shifts of the high and low molecular 
weight forms of phospholamban was similar to that obtained with 
Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase alone. The results of pulse-chase 
experiments involving the centrifuge column method suggested that the site(s) of 
phosphorylation by cAMP- and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activities 
are on the same phospholamban molecule. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of 
phosphorylated phospholamban indicated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase 
phosphorylates at a single site, A, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
phosphorylates at sites C1 and C2 in the low molecular weight form, where A is 
different from C1 but may be the same as C2. The high molecular weight form of 
phospholamban is suggested to be a pentamer of identical monomers (low molecular 
weight form) having one phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase 
and two for Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
3961454,"Iatrogenic diseases are defined as illnesses due to diagnostic or therapeutic 
procedures. The authors explore the possibility of recording iatrogenic diseases 
by a physician self-monitoring system. The responsible physician himself records 
his/her patients' iatrogenic complications on hospital discharge, after which 
the authors examine retrospectively all charts of the patients involved and a 
random sample of patients not included. The results show that in one year 208 of 
1618 patients were recorded as having an iatrogenic disease which was severe in 
88. 7.1% of these cases were not confirmed retrospectively (false positives). On 
the other hand, about one third of iatrogenic illnesses were not recorded (false 
negatives), though these were less severe cases only. We calculated that 17% of 
our patients had iatrogenic diseases, 22% of these were predictable. About a 
third of the patients had iatrogenic disease before hospital admission, and 
these patients had more severe, and other, iatrogenic diseases than those who 
acquired them during hospitalization. Iatrogenic complications affect other 
organ systems than non-iatrogenic acquired diseases. On average, patients with 
iatrogenic diseases were 6 years older and hospitalized 10 days longer than 
other patients. Although not all cases may be recorded, we believe that 
physician self-monitoring is preferable to other systems for recording 
iatrogenic diseases, since it may have a direct teaching effect on those who 
cause the illness."
3963054,"Recently it has been shown that most cases of the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) 
are caused by deletion 17p13.3. All familial cases have been associated with a 
balanced reciprocal translocation in a carrier parent and unbalanced 
translocations in their affected offspring. We report a new case of familial MDS 
in whom the mother carries a pericentric inversion of chromosome 17. She has had 
two children with MDS, one of whom was shown to carry a recombinant 17 
consisting of dup(17q) and del(17p). The high frequency of familial MDS and its 
consistent association with balanced chromosomal rearrangements in one of the 
parents makes it important to do high-resolution chromosome analysis on all 
patients with MDS and possibly all patients with lissencephaly. Finding a 
familial balanced rearrangement makes prenatal diagnosis of this condition 
feasible."
3965026,"Infective embolic retinopathy as a sequela of bacterial endocarditis is 
described in a 31-year-old woman with mitral valve prolapse. The infective 
organism, Corynebacterium minutissimum, has not been previously found to cause 
ocular or multisystem diseases. It is a common mucocutaneous inhabitant which 
causes erythrasma. In our case report both ocular involvement and septicaemia 
were present. The infection was confirmed by positive serial blood cultures. 
Mitral valve prolapse was confirmed by echocardiography. On clinical examination 
the retinopathy consisted of white intraretinal lesions which resolved with 
antibiotic therapy. By fluorescein angiography focal areas of hypofluorescence 
corresponding to the white fundus lesions were present. Optic disc oedema was 
also seen."
3967429,"Threaded compression rods were placed between the posterior-superior spines as a 
means of posterior stabilization of pelvic fractures. To document the increase 
in sacroiliac stability afforded by this technique, biomechanical testing was 
performed. Malgaigne-type fractures with sacroiliac disruptions were created in 
four cadaver pelvises. The fractures were stabilized with anterior frames of the 
Slatis or Pittsburgh type and subjected to longitudinal and torsional loading 
patterns on an Instron machine. The anterior fixation was then augmented with 
threaded compression rods placed between the posterior-superior spines to 
compress the disrupted sacroiliac joints, and repeat testing was conducted. 
Anterior frames alone were found to provide little stabilization of the 
disrupted sacroiliac joints with either longitudinal or torsional loading. 
Markedly improved stabilization in both loading modes was achieved with 
posterior augmentation. Two typical cases are presented to demonstrate that 
posterior stabilization is as efficacious in clinical practice as in the 
biomechanics laboratory."
3968944,"140 patients with various forms of sensorineural hearing loss were examined via 
the glycerol test (Klockhoff). In 66% of the cases with Menière's disease, a 
typical temporary threshold shift could be seen. 17 patients with fluctuating 
hearing loss of unknown etiology without vestibular symptoms showed a similar 
effect; they were classified as belonging to the group of the cochlear type of 
Menière's disease. In 34% of cases with clinically assured diagnosis of 
Ménière's disease, glycerol did not induce improvement in hearing. Repeated 
glycerol tests revealed varying results; shortly after a Menière attack, the 
glycerol test was usually negative, whereas shortly before the next attack the 
glycerol test changed to positive. These data support the specificity of the 
glycerol test: The results depend on the presence of endolymphatic hydrops at 
the time of examination. Positive results of the glycerol test were also seen in 
the cases of reduced sensorineural hearing associated with syphilis, as well as 
in cases of cerebrospinal pressure changing synchronously with fluctuating 
hearing loss (Lindsay and Zajtschuk). In all other cases of sensorineural 
hearing losses, no positive effect of the glycerol test has been found."
3991250,"Vancomycin pharmacokinetics were studied in nine premature infants. Infants 
weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug 
distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature 
infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. These differences alter the 
vancomycin dosing recommendations in these two groups of premature infants. We 
recommend initial dosage regimens consisting of a loading dose of vancomycin of 
25 mg/kg followed by doses of 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for infants with weights 
less than 1,000 gm. Infants weighing over 1,000 gm should receive 10 mg/kg every 
12 hours, with a loading dose of 12.5 mg/kg. Serum vancomycin concentration 
should be monitored, however, for final optimization of therapy."
3993677,"We studied after death a 3-month-old girl whose karyotype was 
45,XX,-15,-17,+der(17),t(15;17)(q13;p13.3) and thus combines abnormalities of 
chromosome 15 associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome and of chromosome 17 
associated with the Miller-Dieker syndrome. This infant had several 
manifestations of the Prader-Willi syndrome in infancy but none of the 
Miller-Dieker syndrome. We propose that essentially no loss of 17p material has 
occurred and confirm previous reports that the critical region for the 
production of the Miller-Dieker phenotype is located subterminally in the 
17p13.3 region."
3996596,"Prokaryotic, eukaryotic and mitochondrial DNA sequences of total Length 300 000 
nucleotides have been analyzed to find out whether stretches of alternating 
purines and pyrimidines are unusual in terms of occurrence, composition and base 
sequence. Alternating runs longer than 5 nucleotides are significantly 
under-represented in the natural sequences as compared to random ones. 
Octanucleotides are the most deficient, occurring at only 60% of the frequency 
expected in random sequences. An unexpectedly high proportion of these octamers 
consists of alternating tetramers with the repeat structure (PuPyPuPy)2 or 
(PyPuPyPu)2. DNA stretches containing such sequences can potentially form a S1 
nuclease sensitive slippage (staggered loop) structure, which might serve as a 
locally unstacked intermediate in the B- to Z-DNA conformational transition."
4022362,"A woman with early-onset, slowly progressive, humeroperoneal muscle weakness had 
marked restriction of neck flexion with contracture at the elbows. She developed 
exertional dyspnea at age 25, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate was 
discovered, and a cardiac pacemaker was implanted. Her father had a similar 
disorder. There is at least one other report of autosomal dominant transmission 
of this clinical picture, which had previously only been reported as 
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with X-linked recessive inheritance. Thus, 
more than one mode of inheritance is possible for this unusual and distinctive 
form of muscular dystrophy."
4072955,"The differential effect of two diets, taken in synchrony with the menstrual 
cycles for 2 wk each, on serum and bile lipids was investigated in young healthy 
women. The ""normal"" diet was high in cholesterol and total fat, and low in 
polyunsaturated fat and fiber; the ""prudent"" diet contained a high proportion of 
polyunsaturated fat and fiber, but was low in cholesterol and total fat; there 
was little difference in energy content. Both in whole serum and in low-density 
lipoprotein the concentrations of cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were almost 
30% lower with the ""prudent"" than with the ""normal"" diet; HDL-cholesterol was 
16.3% lower. Triglycerides were increased, only in the very-low-density 
lipoproteins while cholesterol and apolipoprotein B did not change much in this 
fraction. The risk to acquire cholesterol gallstones was not less with the use 
of the ""prudent"" diet as originally expected. While using the ""prudent"" diet 
five of the women had slightly higher lithogenic indices, in two there were much 
higher values (greater than 25%), and only in three the lithogenic index was 
unchanged or slightly lower than with the ""normal"" diet."
4074709,"The first human tumor derived protein with in vivo angiogenic activity to be 
obtained in pure form has been isolated from serum-free supernatants of an 
established human adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) and named angiogenin. It was 
purified by cation-exchange and reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography; the yield was approximately 0.5 microgram/L of medium. 
Biological activity of angiogenin was monitored throughout purification by using 
the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. Statistical evaluation 
demonstrates that it displays activity in this system with as little as 35 fmol 
per egg. Moreover, only 3.5 pmol is required to induce extensive blood vessel 
growth in the rabbit cornea. The amino acid composition of this basic 
(isoelectric point greater than 9.5), single-chain protein of molecular weight 
approximately 14 400 has been determined. The amino terminus is blocked, and the 
carboxyl-terminal residue is proline."
4076189,"The crystal structure of the protein postsynaptic neurotoxin, erabutoxin b, has 
been refined at 0.140-nm resolution (R = 0.22) by restrained least-squares and

identity of the two sea-snake venom toxins, erabutoxin b and neurotoxin b, 
isolated from Laticauda semifasciata snakes taken in different Pacific Ocean 
waters. Two chemical-sequence inversion errors in erabutoxin b have been 
discovered during refinement, corrected and subsequently confirmed in both 
erabutoxin b and erabutoxin a by chemical analysis. The correct sequences are 
His6-Gln7, hitherto unsuspected, and Ser18-Pro19. The sequence correction 
His6-Gln7 explains the anomalous results of 1H NMR solution studies and those of 
early chemical modification experiments, which were in conflict with the 
previously published three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b. On refinement, 
the five-stranded beta sheet described earlier is now shown to be discontinuous,

[(3)H]monoacetyl-alpha-bungarotoxin block the endplate acetylcholine receptors, 
each binding to the same extent. The effect of bungarotoxin is partially 
reversible. These electrophysiological results, together with the effects of 
perhydrohistrionicotoxin and/or d-tubocurarine on the binding of 
[(3)H]monoacetyl-alpha-bungarotoxin at endplates of murine diaphragm muscle and 
on the bungarotoxin-elicited irreversible blockade of neuromuscular 
transmission, suggest that at least two types of sites participate in the 
synaptic excitation by acetylcholine. One site, competitively blocked by 
bungarotoxin and by curare, is presumably the acetylcholine receptor. Binding of 
bungarotoxin at this site is responsible for an irreversible blockade of 
neuromuscular transmission. The second site, competitively blocked by 
bungarotoxin and perhydrohistrionicotoxin, is proposed to be part of the 
cholinergic ion conductance modulator. Binding of bungarotoxin to this site does 
not result in an irreversible blockade."
4412271,"Over the past 7 years, 151 patients with malignant melanoma have been treated 
with BCG immunotherapy alone or as an adjunct to surgical therapy. Direct 
injection of metastatic melanoma lesions limited to skin resulted in 90% 
regression of injected lesions and 17% regression of uninjected lesions in 
immunocompetent patients. Approximately 25% of these patients remained free of 
disease for 1 to 6 years. Direct injections of BCG into nodules of patients with 
subcutaneous or visceral metastases resulted in a lower incidence of local 
control and no long term survivors. Attempts to improve the results of 
immunotherapy in these patients by palliative surgical resection of large 
metastatic lesions to lower tumor burden followed by BCG immunotherapy 
significantly improved the results although many patients still developed 
recurrent disease. Early results of a clinical trial combining BCG immunotherapy 
with regional lymphadenectomy in patients with melanoma metastatic to lymph 
nodes have been encouraging and promising. Further controlled clinical trials 
are necessary to elucidate the role of BCG in immunotherapy. However, since BCG 
is but one of a number of potential immunologic adjuvants, even more effective 
immunotherapy will be possible as further knowledge of the interactions of 
cellular and humoral immunity is acquired."
4624352,"The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized clinically by choreoathetosis, 
spasticity, selfmutilation, and mental and growth retardation. Biochemically, 
there is a striking reduction of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 
(HGPRT) activity in affected individuals. We have examined erythrocytes from 14 
patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome for the presence of hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase activity and enzyme protein. In contrast to the usual 
finding of no detectable hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 
activity, we have found low levels (0.002-0.79 nmoles/mg protein per hr) of 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in erythrocyte lysates 
from five of these patients. In three of the five patients, hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase activity appeared to be substantially more labile in 
vivo than normal using erythrocytes which had been separated according to their 
density (age). Immunochemical studies using a monospecific antiserum prepared 
from a homogeneous preparation of normal human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase revealed immunoreactive protein (CRM) in hemolysate 
from all 14 patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The immunoreactive protein 
from each patient gave a reaction of complete identity with normal erythrocyte 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and was present in quantities 
equal to those observed in normal erythrocytes. In addition, a constant amount 
of CRM was found in erythrocytes of increasing density (age) from patients with 
the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome despite the decreasing hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase activity. These studies confirm previous data which 
indicate that the mutations leading to the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are usually, if 
not always on the structural gene coding for hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase. In addition, although the mutant proteins appear to 
be present in normal amounts, they are often very labile in vivo with respect to 
enzymatic activity. These observations suggest that therapy directed at 
stabilization or activation of enzyme activity in vivo may be of potential 
benefit."
4625625,"The growth of a strain of Bacillus megaterium was prevented by a minimal 
inhibitory concentration of primaquine of 52 mug/ml or 2 x 10(-4)m. When 
exponentially growing cultures received the drug at 6 x 10(-4)m, the rate of 
growth was drastically reduced and no further growth occurred after 15 min of 
exposure. At this concentration, primaquine was bactericidal, causing a 50% 
reduction in the viable population after one doubling time of 45 min. Supplying 
primaquine to cultures 30 min after adding radioactive-labeled phenylalanine, 
thymidine, uracil, or diaminopimelic acid produced an immediate and complete 
inhibition of protein biosynthesis but no inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid 
biosynthesis for at least 15 min, and caused the formation of ribonucleic acid 
and cell wall polymer to proceed linearly at rates similar to those established 
prior to the addition of drug. This pattern of inhibition of macromolecular 
biosyntheses suggests that the major in vivo action of primaquine in B. 
megaterium is to block protein synthesis."
4664580,"Erabutoxin c, a minor neurotoxic component of the venom of a sea snake Laticauda 
semifasciata, was isolated in pure form by repeated column chromatography on 
CM-cellulose columns. The toxin was crystallizable and monodisperse in 
rechromatography, disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (isoelectric 
point, pH9.23-9.25). The molecular weight of the toxin, as estimated by gel 
filtration, was 7000. The toxin showed the same lethal activity to mice 
(0.13mug/g body wt., intramuscular injection) and the same effect on isolated 
frog muscle as erabutoxins a and b, the main toxic components of the venom. The 
toxin inhibited the acetylcholine contracture but not the potassium chloride 
contracture of muscle. Erabutoxin c consisted of 62 amino acid residues, 
containing one fewer lysine and one more histidine than erabutoxin a and one 
fewer lysine and one more aspartic acid (or asparagine) than erabutoxin b. 
Erabutoxin c was reduced, S-carboxymethylated and hydrolysed with trypsin. The 
only fragment different from the corresponding fragments from erabutoxin b was 
hydrolysed further with pepsin. One of the peptic fragments, which was assumed 
to have the aspartic acid (or asparagine) residue in question at the C-terminal 
end, was treated with carboxypeptidase A. The C-terminal residue was found to be 
an asparagine. It was therefore concluded that erabutoxin c was 
[51-asparagine]-erabutoxin b."

4992370,"Parallel studies were performed with methionineless derivatives of Escherichia 
coli 15 T(-) and Bacillus megaterium KM: T(-). Methylated bases are present in 
the total cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) of B. megaterium. The level of RNA 
methylation in E. coli is about 60% greater than that in B. megaterium. Although 
E. coli deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was found to contain 0.12% 5-methylcytosine 
(5-MC) and 0.24% 6-methylaminopurine (6-MA), methylated bases were not detected 
in the DNA of B. megaterium. Assuming a molecular weight of 7 x 10(9) daltons 
for B. megaterium DNA, it was calculated that this organism could not contain 
more than one molecule of 5-MC or 6-MA per genome, and that possibly no 
methylated bases were present. Methylated bases were also not detected in the 
DNA of thymine-starved B. megaterium. Crude extracts of this organism possess 
RNA methylase activity but no detectable DNA methylase activity."
5262992,"Intracellular potentials of brown fat cells in lightly anesthetized 
cold-acclimated rats were measured in vivo. The effects of adrenergic agonists 
and antagonists on these potentials were examined in an attempt to relate the 
electrical activity of the cells to the adrenergic-induced stimulation of brown 
fat thermogenesis.Norepinephrine, the physiological mediator of brown fat heat 
production, significantly depolarized the membrane of these cells in vivo. This 
was effected either upon norepinephrine administration (3-100 mug/kg body wt) or 
excitation of the transsected nerve trunk to the interscapular fat pad and 
appreciably inhibited (55%) by doses of propranolol (1 mg/kg) sufficient to 
abolish the temperature increase of the tissue. Since theophylline (325 mum/kg) 
did not depolarize the cells, although it stimulated thermogenesis in the 
tissue, the depolarizing effect of norepinephrine is interpreted as being at 
least partially associated with biochemical events terminating in the activation 
of adenylate cyclase. However, the norepinephrine-induced electrical changes and 
the ensuing increase in brown fat thermogenesis appear to be causally 
independent and experimentally separable. On the other hand, our data do not 
preclude the speculation that the membrane phenomenon, if accompanied by 
increased Na(+), may serve partially to regulate the metabolic rate of brown fat 
during long-term physiological stimulation (e.g., cold stress) by increasing the 
rate of ATP utilization via the Na(+)/K(+) pump."
5447715,"In this investigation an attempt has been made to determine the relationship 
between the staining of permanent teeth by tetracycline administered during the 
period of tooth formation with the dosage of the drug and the duration of 
therapy. Of 238 subjects whose hospital records indicated ingestion of stated 
doses of tetracycline, some 49 were seen to have staining which was confirmed by 
fluorescence, and a further six had staining which did not fluoresce and hence 
could not be confirmed. A definite relationship between total dosage and 
staining and duration of administration and staining was established; the 
condition occurred with greater frequency (in more than one-third of the 
children) when the total dosage exceeded 3 g. or the duration of treatment was 
longer than 10 days. However, as staining was seen at all dosage levels, 
whatever the duration, physicians should continue to follow previous advice and 
prescribe other antibiotics where possible for children under 8 years of age or 
for women in the last trimester of pregnancy."
5776549,"A case of leptomeningeal melanoma in an African child of 7 years is presented 
together with a survey of pigmentation in the normal African brain. There is a 
direct relationship between the depth of pigment of the leptomeninges and the 
skin in Ugandan Africans, suggesting that similar factors operate in the control 
of melanocytes in these two sites."
5964959,"1. The toxic principles in the venom of the sea-snake Laticauda semifasciata 
were separated into two components by CM-cellulose chromatography and obtained 
in crystalline forms. They were named ;erabutoxins a and b'. 2. The homogeneity 
of each toxin was shown by rechromatography, by disk electrophoresis, by 
ultracentrifuging, by toxicity measurements before and after repeated 
crystallizations and by N-terminal analysis. 3. They had molecular weights of 
about 7000. Both of them contained 61 (or 62) amino acid residues/molecule. The 
only difference between erabutoxins a and b was that one of the aspartic acid 
(or asparagine) residues in erabutoxin a was replaced by a histidine residue in 
erabutoxin b. 4. Both of the toxins had LD(50) values of 0.15mug./g. body wt. 
for mice and 0.07mug./g. for rats. It was shown with frog-muscle preparations 
that they acted on postsynaptic membrane to block neuromuscular transmission."
6065875,"Flow through the sphincter of Oddi was studied by a constant-pressure perfusion 
apparatus, and by using a constant rate of infusion and measuring pressure 
changes just proximal to the sphincter. Pressure changes from balloons placed in 
the gastric antrum and duodenum were recorded. Despite considerable variation in 
activity and behaviour, the following conclusions were reached.1. The sphincter 
of Oddi appears to be partially autonomous but is readily affected by changes in 
duodenal tone.2. Reflex inhibition of the sphincter of Oddi is seen on 
electrical and mechanical stimulation of the gall-bladder but not with passive 
pressure changes within the gall-bladder.3. This reflex is relayed through the 
coeliac ganglion.4. There is a definite relationship between gastric antral 
activity and flow through the sphincter of Oddi. This is more obvious when food 
is present in the stomach.5. Mechanical or electrical stimulation of the 
stomach, duodenum, or upper small bowel influences the tone of the sphincter of 
Oddi."
6090122,"We have isolated mutants defective in DNA topoisomerases and an endonuclease 
from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by screening individual 
extracts of mutagenized cells. Two type I topoisomerase mutants (top1) and three 
endonuclease mutants (end1) were all viable. The double mutant top1 end1 was 
also viable and, in its extract, Mg2+- and ATP- dependent type II activity could 
be detected. Three temperature-sensitive (ts-) mutants having heat-sensitive 
(hs-) type II enzymes were isolated, and the ts- marker cosegregated with the 
hs- type II activity. All the ts- mutations fell in one gene (top2) tightly 
linked to leul in chromosome II. The nuclear division of single top2 mutants was 
blocked at the restrictive temperature, but the formation of a septum was not 
inhibited so that the nucleus was cut across with the cell plate. In contrast, 
the double top1 top2 mutants were rapidly arrested at various stages of the cell 
cycle, showing a strikingly altered nuclear chromatin region. The type II 
topoisomerase may have an essential role in the compaction and/or segregation of 
chromosomes during the nuclear division but also complement the defect of the 
type I enzyme whose major function is the maintenance of chromatin organization 
throughout the cell cycle."
6093898,"The in vivo translocation of thyroxine-binding blood serum prealbumin (TBPA) was 
studied. It was found that the TBPA-hormone complex penetrates-through the 
plasma membrane into the cytoplasm of target cells. Electron microscopic 
autoradiography revealed that blood serum TBPA is localized in ribosomes of 
target cells as well as in mitochondria, lipid droplets and Golgi complex. 
Negligible amounts of the translocated TBPA is localized in lysosomes of the 
cells insensitive to thyroid hormones (spleen macrophages). Study of T4- and 
T3-binding proteins from rat liver cytoplasm demonstrated that one of them has 
the antigenic determinants common with those of TBPA. It was shown 
autoimmunoradiographically that the structure of TBPA is not altered during its 
translocation."
6094171,"The thyroid hormone decarboxylation product, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM), 
has been shown to inhibit the cAMP production stimulated by isoproterenol in 
turkey erythrocytes. This adrenergic receptor binding inhibition was not shown 
by the thyroid hormones nor by tyramine, but was observed for 
3,5-diiodotyramine, 3,5-diiodothyronamine, and thyronamine. T3AM also inhibits 
prolactin secretion in cultured pituitary cells as well as domperidon binding in 
rat corpora striata membranes. T3AM has no thyromimetic activity at the nuclear 
level. The molecular structure of T3AM, determined as a borosalicylate salt by 
X-ray diffraction techniques, is the first report of a decarboxylated thyroid 
hormone analogue."
6099579,"Restriction endonucleases play a very important role in genetic engineering and 
DNA mapping. Among hundreds of restriction endonucleases, the Eco R1 enzyme is 
the most useful and widely investigated enzyme. After sonication and 
ultracentrifugation, crude extracts of E. coli RY 13 were purified by employing 
the polyethyleneimine precipitate, ammonium sulfate precipitate and heparin 
Sepharose-4B affinity column chromatography. The Eco R1 enzyme were purified at 
about 42 folds and the specific activity was about 100,000 U/mg of protein. The 
whole purification procedure was finished within two days. The recovery was 
about 42%. The enzyme was sufficiently concentrated for direct specific DNA 
hydrolysis."
6109943,"Wilson's disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism, characterised by 
raised liver-copper concentrations and low serum levels of copper and 
caeruloplasmin. The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance strongly suggests 
that mutation of a single gene causes the impairment of both caeruloplasmin 
synthesis and biliary copper excretion. The normal infant is born with the 
biochemical features of Wilson's disease (very high liver-copper levels and low 
serum copper and caeruloplasmin). Induction of normal copper metabolism after 
birth results in a fall in liver-copper concentrations and rise in serum 
caeruloplasmin. The repression of normal copper metabolism in the fetus and its 
induction after birth is probably regulated by a controller gene. It is 
suggested that mutation of a controller rather than a structural gene underlies 
the pathogenesis of Wilson's disease and that the disease results from failure 
to switch from the positive copper balance of the fetus to the normal copper 
balance of the child."
6119179,"1. We sought to determine if catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes of spontaneously 
hypertensive rats (SHR) differed from those of normotensive Wistar--Kyoto (WKY) 
and Sprague--Dawley (SD) control rats before birth. 2. By immunocytochemical and 
biochemical methods we compared strains for the time of appearance and 
maturation of the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase 
(DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in sympathetic ganglia 
and adrenals. 3. The time of appearance of enzymes was identical in all three 
strains: TH and DBH first appeared in sympathetic ganglia on embryonic day 11 
(E11) and in adrenal medulla on E16. PNMT, restricted to adrenal medulla, 
appeared later on E18. 4. The activity of adrenal TH prenatally on E18 and E21 
and at day of birth (P1) in SHR was approximately two fold that in WKY or SD 
rats. In contrast PNMT was lower in SHR but only on E18. 5. Thus, although the 
timing of the first expression of adrenergic phenotypes is similar in SHR and 
normotensive controls, the differences in TH activity in adrenals suggest an 
enhanced biosynthetic capacity for catecholamines in this strain before birth. 
6. We conclude that SHR differ from normotensive rats from the first expression 
of some of the genes controlling catecholamine biosynthesis."
6163355,"Satellite III DNA has been located by in situ hybridization in chromosomes 1, 
3--5, 7, 9, 10, 13--18, 20--22, and Y and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in the 
acrocentric chromosomes 13--15, 21, and 22. In the acrocentric chromosomes, the 
satellite DNA is located in the short arm. Here we report comparisons by in situ 
hybridization of the amount of satellite DNA in Robertsonian translocation and 
""normal variant"" chromosomes with that in their homologs. In almost all 
dicentric Robertsonian translocations, the amount of satellite DNA is less than 
that in the normal homologs, but it is rarely completely absent, indicating that 
satellite DNA is located between the centromere and the nucleolus organizer 
region (NOR) and that the breakpoints are within the satellite DNA. The amount 
of satellite DNA shows a range of variation in ""normal"" chromosomes, and this is 
still more extreme in ""normal variant"" chromosomes, those with large short arm 
(p+ or ph+) generally having more satellite DNA than those with small short arms 
(p- or ph-). The cytological satellites are heterogeneous in DNA content; some 
contain satellite DNA, others apparently do not, and the satellite DNA content 
is not related to the size or intensity of fluorescence of the satellites. The 
significance of these variations for the putative functions of satellite DNA is 
discussed."
6164221,"Dopa, catecholamines, and dopac were determined in superior cervical ganglia of 
albino rats. The average amount of dopa in ganglia of control animals was 
1.1--1.6 micrograms/g. The concentrations of catecholamines and dopac were 
similar to values reported by others. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor 
alpha-methylparatyrosine methyl ester caused marked decrease in the dopa 
concentration in the ganglia. The effect of reserpine was less pronounced. The 
aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa 
concentration."
6164769,"The activities of the red blood cell enzymes transketolase, glutathione 
reductase, and glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase were measured with and without 
in vitro addition of their respective coenzyme components thiamine, riboflavin, 
and pyridoxine in a group of patients with neurological disorders which may have 
been caused by malnutrition, intestinal malabsorption, hepatic failure or 
neoplasms arising outside the nervous system. The incidence of thiamine 
deficiency was 31%, of riboflavin deficiency 22% and of pyridoxine deficiency 
6%. Alcoholics in particular suffered from deficiencies of vitamin B 1, and B 2. 
There was a correlation of vitamin B 1 and B 2 deficiency and signs of a 
cerebellar and/or brainstem lesion. The most frequent symptoms in this 
connection were gait disturbances and oculomotor signs like spontaneous and gaze 
nystagmus, disturbed eye tracking, diminished optokinetic nystagmus, decreased 
ability to suppress vestibular nystagmus by fixation. These signs hardly ever 
occurred in alcoholic patients who showed no deficiency of vitamin B 1, B 2 or B 
6. Whenever they do appear, a vitamin B supplementation has to be performed in 
order to prevent the manifestation of Wernicke's encephalopathy, cerebral or 
cerebellar atrophy. Alcoholics showed the same incidence of polyneuropathy, 
whether they suffered from a deficiency of B vitamins or not. Deficiencies of 
vitamin B 1, B 2 or B 6 were also found in patients with intestinal 
malabsorption and polyneuropathy, diabetic polyneuropathy, optic atrophy, 
myelopathy and cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology, neurological 
manifestations of neoplasms arising outside the nervous system, B 12 
myeloencephalopathy and Thévenard's syndrome."
6165468,"The comparative pulmonary toxicity induced by bleomycin and talisomycin (former 
trivial name: tallysomycin A) was evaluated by measuring lung hydroxyproline 
content. Based on published subacute toxicity data, in which talisomycin was 
found to be four times as toxic as bleomycin, the following doses of each drug 
were given sc to BDF1 male mice twice weekly for 4 weeks: 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg 
of bleomycin and 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 mg/kg of talisomycin. Equivalent 
dose-related effects in body weight were produced by bleomycin and talisomycin 
at a respective dose ratio of 4:1. Similarly, equivalent dose-dependent 
increases in lung hydroxyproline content, an index of collagen, were produced by 
bleomycin and talisomycin. Neither drug caused deaths at the doses used."
6165649,"Cloned DNA fragments form the human beta-like globin genomic region can be 
transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III. We have investigated the structure 
of two templates and their transcripts by DNA sequencing, size fractionation of 
ribonuclease T1 generated oligonucleotides, and ribonuclease H digestion of RNA 
: DNA duplexes. The data indicate the repetitive DNA sequences, members of the 
Alu family of interpersed 300 bp reiterated DNA, are imbedded in both templates. 
The RNAs transcribed from them are composed of an entire Alu family sequence at 
their 5' ends linked to 3' ends of non-repetitive sequence."
6167758,"To apply safely an aggressive chemotherapy regimen like CESS 81 requires 
intensive supportive care. Bleomycin is evaluated as part of the protocol for 
treatment of primary Ewing's sarcoma. Bleomycin might cause pulmonary fibrosis 
at higher cumulative doses as toxic effect directly to the lungs or most likely 
in addition by the formation of vascular microthrombi. A randomized study is 
designed to evaluate if pulmonary changes due to Bleomycin can be prevented 
using heparin. As severe bone marrow depression is anticipated the effect of 
lithium on the leucocyte nadir is also subject of a randomized study."
6173130,"We previously demonstrated that pseudogenes complementary to the small nuclear 
RNAs U1, U2 and U3 are dispersed and abundant in the human genome. Here we 
report that three pseudogenes (U1.101, U2.13 and U3.5) are flanked by perfect 
short direct repeats of 16 to 19 base pairs. In all three pseudogenes. the 
upstream direct repeat abuts a DNA sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the 
mature snRNA; in U2.13 and U3.5, the downstream direct repeat immediately 
follows the truncated 3' end of the snRNA sequence, whereas in U1.101, the 
downstream direct repeat is separated from the 3, end of the full-length snRNA 
sequence by a short A-rich region. We consider the direct repeats to be an 
indication that these three pseudogenes were created by insertion of snRNA 
information into a new chromosomal locus. To explain why the upstream repeat 
abuts a DNA sequence complementary to the 5' end of the mature snRNA, we propose 
a model for insertion that uses a reverse transcript of the snRNA as an 
intermediate. Furthermore, we note similarities between the structure of all 
three pseudogene loci and the Alu family of middle repetitive DNA sequences. 
These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic 
elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a 
cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase 
III."
6177004,"We have assigned the gene (B2m) coding for murine beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) to 
mouse chromosome 2 by using a novel panel of Chinese hamster-mouse somatic cell 
hybrid clones. Because of 35 independent primary hybrids used in this study were 
derived from two types of feral mice, each with a different combination of 
Robertsonian translocation chromosomes, as well as from mice with a normal 
complement of acrocentric chromosomes, analysis of 16 selected mouse enzyme 
markers provided data on the segregation of all 20 mouse chromosomes in these 
hybrids. Mouse B2M was identified in cell hybrids by immunoprecipitation with a 
species-specific anti-mouse B2M antiserum followed by two-dimensional 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated polypeptides. 
Enzyme analysis of the segregant clones excluded all chromosomes for B2m 
assignment except mouse chromosome 2, and karyotype analysis of nine informative 
hybrid clones confirmed the assignment of B2m to this chromosome. These results 
demonstrate that, in the mouse, as in man, B2m is not linked to the major 
histocompatibility or immunoglobulin loci."
6178494,"A case of Klinefelter's syndrome with the development of a mediastinal 
teratocarcinoma is reported suggesting that the association of a 
gonadotropin-secreting tumor with the XXY chromosomal abnormality may be more 
than coincidental. Whereas this child appeared to survive the effects of the 
teratocarcinoma, he succumbed to acute leukemia two years later. This prompted a 
review of secondary leukemias in children following chemotherapy/radiotherapy 
for another primary malignancy. These patients responded poorly to treatment of 
the secondary leukemia with a median survival of about four months. The 
incidence of secondary leukemias might be expected to be on the rise as 
increasing numbers of pediatric cancer patients are surviving longer after 
treatment with agents that are potentially leukemogenic or carcinogenic 
themselves. Children who have survived cancer and its therapy present special 
problems and it will be necessary for the pediatrician and practitioner to 
monitor these children."
6178551,"The mast cell is the cellular basis for immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction is attributable to 
IgE molecules fixed to specific membrane receptors which, when stimulated by 
specific antigen, initiates the process of degranulation of the mast cell. The 
granules provide three separate sources of biologic activity: performed or 
primary mediators, newly generated or secondary mediators, and activities 
associated with the granular matrix. A number of biologic consequences are 
generated in response to these mediators and these include: increased vascular 
permeability, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm, polymorphonuclear leukocyte 
chemotaxis, stimulation of adenylate and guanylate cyclase, superoxide radical 
generation, prostaglandin formation, mucous and gastric acid secretion, 
hypotension, tissue destruction, and mononuclear leukocyte infiltration. This 
pharmacopia of activities accounts for the clinical aspects of allergic 
diseases, suggests that the mast cell granule may be involved in the host's 
defense against parasitic infections, and is compatible with a suggested role of 
the mast cell as a widely distributed, monocellular endocrine system."
6179111,"While the health of the general population is not adversely affected by the 
exposure the pesticides in food and environment, workers, who have during their 
occupation been intensely exposed to pesticides, exhibit a higher prevalence of 
slight neurotoxic symptoms. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 
of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, 
show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman 
demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who 
exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy."
6180691,"Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, defined as the rapid alternation of the 
QRS complexes with successive opposing axial deviation, is a rare arrhythmia. In 
the rare cases which have undergone endocavitary investigations, an infrahisian 
origin has generally been proved. However, the mechanism of these tachycardias 
remains poorly understood and is discussed with respect to a new case. 
Bidirectional tachycardia occurred in a 79 year old woman with previous 
diaphragmatic and anterior wall infarction. It was a wide QRS tachycardia at 
180/min with a succession of ventriculogrammes of opposing axis in the frontal 
plane and permanent right bundle branch block over the right precordium. The two 
types of tachycardia were observed, monomorphic type A or Type B or a 
combination of the two realising an A-B bidirectional tachycardia. The origin of 
these episodes, which occurred on a background of atrial tachycardia at about 
100/min, was ventricular as shown by the absence of a His potential before the 
ventricular complexes in tachycardia. The presence of ventricular extrasystoles 
with relatively fixed coupling intervals, and the results of endocavitary 
investigation were suggestive of a reentry phenomenon ventricular extrastimuli 
were capable of transforming the bidirectional into monomorphic tachycardia and 
vice versa; this suggests that A was at times the origin of a reentry B, but 
protected by A, tachycardia B could be sustained. In the light of previously 
reported cases with documented endocavitary investigation and this new case, it 
seems possible to talk in terms of true ""bidirectional ventricular tachycardia"", 
a tachycardia whose mechanism is obscure but certainly not univocal."
6192740,"In order to see if exposure to cold temperature affects the development of 
bleomycin lung toxicity in mammals, 14 rats received endotracheal injections of 
bleomycin, while another 14 rats received saline. Half of the saline-treated 
animals were then exposed to room temperature for 7 days (SRT), and half were 
exposed to 4 degrees C for 7 days (SC). The bleomycin-treated animals similarly 
yielded groups kept at room temperature (BRT) and in the cold (BC). After 1 wk 
the rats were killed and the lungs were sectioned for assessment of histologic 
changes. All the bleomycin-treated animals had evidence of lung toxicity but 
this was much less marked in group BC than in group BRT. The lungs in group SC 
remained normal. These results were confirmed by morphometric methods, which 
showed significantly increased volume proportions of alveolar walls in groups 
BRT and BC compared with that in groups SRT and SC (p less than 0.001), with BRT 
being greater than BC (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that exposure of 
bleomycin-treated rats to low ambient temperature significantly reduces lung 
toxicity."
6194440,"A single U leads to G transversion in the 3' consensus sequence AAUAAA of the 
adenovirus early region 1A gene was constructed and the effect of this mutation 
on processing of the 3' end of the nuclear early region 1A RNAs was analysed. 
The results demonstrate that the intact AAUAAA is not required for RNA 
polyadenylation but is required for the cleavage step preceding polyadenylation 
to occur efficiently."
6205617,"The effect of hypoxia on the development of bleomycin lung toxicity was studied 
in 26 rats. Thirteen rats received an endotracheal injection of saline, and 13 
rats received a similar injection of 1.5 units of bleomycin in saline. Six 
saline-treated and 6 bleomycin-treated rats were exposed to 10% oxygen for 2 
days prior and 2 days subsequent to the injections, and then breathed air for a 
further 5 days before being killed. The other rats breathed air continuously, 
and were also killed 7 days after the injections. Although all bleomycin-treated 
animals had some evidence of lung toxicity, histologic examination of the lungs 
revealed markedly reduced bleomycin toxicity in the rats exposed to hypoxia. 
This was confirmed by morphometry, which demonstrated that the volume density of 
alveolar walls (mean +/- SEM) was significantly lower in the bleomycin-hypoxia 
group (11.8 +/- 0.8%) than in the bleomycin-air group (18.8 +/- 1.1%) (p less 
than 0.001). It is concluded that hypoxia offers protection against bleomycin 
lung toxicity in the rat."
6214719,"A systematic review of the more than 2,000 genetic loci of man cataloged by 
McKusick indicated that approximately 7% may play a role in modulating the rates 
of development of various aspects of the senescent phenotype. Assuming an upper 
limit of about 100,000 loci in man, numerous alleles at approximately 7,000 loci 
could be contributing to characteristic patterns of aging in individual human 
beings. Point mutations or chromosomal aberrations involving such loci may 
result in various progeroid syndromes. These have been classified into two 
categories: segmental progeroid syndromes, which involve multiple aspects of the 
senescent phenotype, and unimodal progeroid syndromes, in which predominantly 
one aspect of the phenotype is involved. Two different examples of segmental 
progeroid syndromes were discussed: the Werner syndrome (an autosomal recessive) 
and the Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Examples of unimodal progeroid syndromes 
included familial hypercholesterolemia (accelerated atherogenesis), xeroderma 
pigmentosum (acceleration of skin aging, including age-related neoplasms), and 
certain forms of intestinal polyposis (acceleration of adenocarcinoma of the 
colon). It is remarkable and encouraging that the biochemical genetic basis of 
many progeroid syndromes, including all of those mentioned above, may be 
amenable to investigation with cultured mesenchymal somatic cells from 
individual subjects. For example, cells from patients with the Werner's syndrome 
have a striking limitation of their in vitro replicative life-spans and undergo 
extensive chromosomal rearrangements. These abnormalities are presumably related 
to an enzyme deficiency which, in principle, could be identified by biochemical 
studies of cultured cells."
6225397,"Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex' syndrome) is a rare but clinically 
distinctive dermatosis that has been associated in all reported cases, to our 
knowledge, with either a primary malignant neoplasm of the upper aerodigestive 
tract or metastatic cancer to the lymph nodes of the neck. Acrokeratosis 
paraneoplastica was found in a 53-year-old black man with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the tonsil. A distinctive series of changes was found on 
histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens taken from his skin lesions, and 
direct immunofluorescence microscopy of both lesional and nonlesional skin 
specimens showed immunoglobulin and complement deposition on the epidermal 
basement membrane. The skin lesions largely resolved following radiation therapy 
of the neoplasm and of the presumably involved lymph nodes."
6226660,"The effects of inhibiting histone deacetylation on the maturation of newly 
replicated chromatin have been examined. HeLa cells were labeled with 
[3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; control experiments 
demonstrated that butyrate did not significantly inhibit DNA replication for at 
least 70 min. Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods 
(0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with 
DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin 
replicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead 
retained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation 
of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: 
therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to 
preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, 
sodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated 
chromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the 
following criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to 
mononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. 
Consistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal 
nuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of 
chromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin 
replication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses 
normal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and 
histone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while 
deacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation 
apparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core 
particle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure."
6249092,"The ergot alkaloids studied do exert selective effects on monoamine receptor 
systems. Lisuride acts as a very potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase in 
cortical brain regions, and may function as a mixed agonist-antagonist at high 
concentrations. It is most likely that in cortex, lisuride effects both dopamine 
and serotonin receptors, but predominantly serotonin receptors coupled to 
adenylate cyclase. The antagonist molindone exhibits selectivity for cortical 
serotonin-stimulated cyclase versus dopamine-stimulated cyclase and may prove 
useful for further elucidating the sites of lisuride action. LSD interacts with 
serotonin-stimulated cortical adenylate cyclase at higher concentrations than 
are needed for lisuride stimulation but, nevertheless, at lower concentrations 
than for serotonin itself (2-4). Bromocriptine, lergotrile and ergonovine may 
also act as agonists in stimulating adenylate cyclase, but with considerably 
less potency, and with differences in regional specificity for this stimulation, 
from lisuride and LSD. Each of these ergots may act as a mixed 
agonist-antagonist at high concentrations. With respect to the regions studied, 
antagonist effects on cyclase appear to be more prominent in striatum than in 
the cortical regions. The greater specificity of lisuride for serotonergic 
cortical receptors should make this compound useful in further studies of this 
system."
6294066,"From the cells of an Escherichia coli K-12 strain, a 22,000-dalton protein which 
has an affinity for the superhelical DNA molecule was purified to apparent 
homogeneity by monitoring the DNA-binding activity using the filter binding 
assay. In the sedimentation analysis of the DNA-protein complex, the protein has 
an affinity for the superhelical or single-stranded DNA molecule but neither for 
the open-circular nor for the linear DNA molecule. The amino acid composition of 
the protein resembled those of the other prokaryotic histone-like proteins and 
also to eukaryotic histones H2A and H2B. The protein precipitated upon heating, 
which is in contrast to the heat-stable feature of the other histone-like 
proteins. Furthermore, DNA and RNA syntheses in vitro were not affected by the 
presence of the protein. In view of these characteristics, this protein may play 
a role in maintaining the bacterial nucleoid structure."
6300765,"A 9.3 kb transposable element of the roo family has been found inserted 3' to 
the Sgs-4 glue protein gene of Drosophila. The X chromosome which carries this 
insert also carries wDZL, a dominant, unstable allele of the white locus caused 
by the insertion of the 13 kb wDZL element. Three deletions isolated from the 
wDZL strain have molecular breakpoints 3' to Sgs-4 that are associated with the 
roo element. Though the deletions eliminate much of the DNA between white and 
Sgs-4, none of the distal breakpoints fall at or near the wDZL element. The 
results suggest that this copia-like element, which is structurally similar to 
an integrated retrovirus, is capable of promoting chromosomal deletions."
6301966,"Thirteen children, aged 10 months to 20 years, presenting with chronic 
cholestasis from the first month of life and with low serum levels of vitamins A 
and/or E, have been investigated for neurological and ophthalmological symptoms. 
Clinical findings consisted of 4 types: peripheral neuropathy; cerebellar 
dysfunction; abnormalities of eye movement, and retinal degenerative changes. 
The results of electrophysiological and morphological studies of muscle and 
nerves were consistent with neurono-axonal degeneration. Electrical 
abnormalities of the retina, especially a decrease of the b wave of 
electroretinogram, appear to be the first sign of the syndrome, allowing early 
detection. Evidence for vitamin deficiency (E or E+A) suggests substitutive 
parenteral treatment in such patients."
6302256,"We report five patients with ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly associated with 
syndactyly or cleft hand or both, and, in addition, macular dystrophy which was 
presumed to be progressive, in an isolated population on a remote island in 
Japan. The heredity of this syndrome was thought to be autosomal recessive. 
Three cases have been reported so far with a combination of the same 
abnormalities. The parents in these cases were consanguineous."
6307612,"Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old 
woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and 
glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe. Previously documented cases 
are reviewed. Discussion focuses on the occurrence of other extracolonic 
abnormalities observed with the Turcot syndrome."
6308151,"The mode of action of curare, a well-known competitive antagonist of 
acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor, was examined with the single channel 
recording technique. Curare can open cholinergic channels in rat myotubes, as 
suggested by Ziskind and Dennis (1978). Moreover another curare molecule can 
then block the curare-activated open channel, in line with previous results 
concerning such a mode of action. In adult rat muscle, the partial agonist 
activity of curare can also be demonstrated, though it is much weaker than in 
embryonic muscle. It is also shown that in adult muscle cell, the conductance of 
the channel (activated either by ACh or by curare) is 50-60 pS, i.e., higher 
than in the myotubes (35 pS)."
6308196,"Vitamin E malabsorption and deficiency during chronic childhood cholestasis has 
been associated with a progressive ataxic neurologic syndrome. Hyporeflexia, the 
first sign of neurologic dysfunction, may begin prior to age 2 years, but severe 
symptoms do not develop until age 5 to 10 years. To establish the age of onset 
of neuropathologic lesions, we prospectively evaluated four young children with 
severe cholestasis. Malabsorption and deficiency of vitamin E were documented by 
low serum vitamin E concentrations, low serum vitamin E to total serum lipids 
ratios, elevated hydrogen peroxide hemolysis, and impaired absorption of a 
pharmacologic dose of alpha-tocopherol. Abnormal neurologic findings in two 
patients were limited to areflexia, ptosis, mild truncal ataxia, and hypotonia; 
two patients had minimal signs of neurologic dysfunction. Sural nerve histology 
at age 6 to 25 months revealed a degenerative axonopathy involving large-caliber 
myelinated fibers, but without quantitative axonal loss. Muscle histology and 
histochemistry tests yielded normal results. Our study suggests that neurologic 
injury may occur during the first two years of life in vitamin E-deficient 
children with cholestatic hepatobiliary disease, obligating aggressive attempts 
at correcting this deficiency state at a very young age."
6310495,"We have detected a DNAseI hypersensitive site in the ribosomal DNA spacer of 
Xenopus laevis and Xenopus borealis. The site is present in blood and embryonic 
nuclei of each species. In interspecies hybrids, however, the site is absent in 
unexpressed borealis rDNA, but is present normally in expressed laevis rDNA. 
Hypersensitive sites are located well upstream (over lkb) of the pre-ribosomal 
RNA promoter. Sequencing of the hypersensitive region in borealis rDNA, however, 
shows extensive homology with the promoter sequence, and with the hypersensitive 
region in X. laevis. Of two promoter-like duplications in each spacer, only the 
most upstream copy is associated with hypersensitivity to DNAaseI. Unlike 
DNAaseI, Endo R. MspI digests the rDNA of laevis blood nuclei at a domain 
extending downstream from the hypersensitive site to near the 40S promoter. 
Since the organisation of conserved sequence elements within this ""proximal 
domain"" is similar in three Xenopus species whose spacers have otherwise evolved 
rapidly, we conclude that this domain plays an important role in rDNA function."
6310570,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes 
from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles 
termed receptosomes (or endosomes). These vesicles have now been purified more 
than 37-fold based on their content of newly internalized epidermal growth 
factor. 125I-labeled EGF was bound to human KB carcinoma cells at 4 degrees C, 
and then the cells were warmed to 37 degrees C for 8 min and disrupted. The 
purification scheme involved density gradient centrifugation on colloidal silica 
and sucrose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-1000. Relative to homogenate, 
receptosomes are enriched 4.3-fold in their cholesterol content and depleted in 
enzyme markers for plasma membranes (2- to 3-fold) and lysosomes (9-fold). 
Receptosomes have a polypeptide composition that is different from plasma 
membrane, lysosome, and other homogenate fractions. They are enriched in 
transferrin receptors (30-fold) and in unidentified Mr 70,000-75,000 
glycoprotein(s); they contain phosphomannosyl receptors. They do not contain 
detectable amounts of clathrin."
6310991,"Sickle-cell anemia results from an A leads to T transversion in the second 
nucleotide of codon 6 of the beta-globin gene. We now report an uncommon 
beta-thalassemia gene that contains a deletion of this nucleotide. Thus, one 
mutation (GAG leads to GTG) produces sickle-cell anemia, while the other (GAG 
leads to GG) eliminates beta-globin production. These data establish that 
different alterations affecting one specific nucleotide can produce either an 
abnormal hemoglobin or beta-thalassemia. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence 
comprising codons 6-8 of the beta-globin gene appears to be particularly 
susceptible to mutations affecting nucleotide number."
6312037,"The binding characteristics of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and 
reverse T3 (rT3) to rat liver plasma membranes (RLPM) were examined to explore 
the interactions of thyroid hormones with cell surface receptors. Scatchard 
analysis suggested that all three ligands bound to two classes of binding sites. 
The high affinity rT3 binding sites appeared to be distinct from the high 
affinity T4 sites, on the basis of differing optimum physicochemical conditions 
for binding, and analog displacement studies. The higher affinity constant for 
T4 was 1.7 +/- 0.2 X 10(9) M-1 (mean +/- SEM) and binding capacity was 3.1 +/- 
0.3 pmol mg-1 protein whereas for rT3 binding the Ka was 2.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(8) M-1 
and capacity was 6.2 +/- 0.9 pmol mg-1. (125I) T3 bound with lower affinity and 
T3 tracer was readily displaced by T4. Moreover, comparatively higher 
concentrations of T3 were needed to displace either radiolabeled T4 or rT3, 
suggesting that T3 was binding to both the T4 and rT3 sites with lower affinity. 
Marker enzyme studies on RLPM, of varying purity prepared by different methods, 
showed a positive correlation between the activity of the plasma membrane enzyme 
magnesium-stimulated ATPase and high affinity rT3 and T4 binding. Column 
chromatography of the radioligands, after dissociation from membrane binding 
sites, confirmed that the integrity of the hormones was not altered during 
association or dissociation. Our results raise the possibility that the high 
affinity T4 and rT3 binding sites on RLPM may be hormone receptors mediating 
biological actions at the membrane level."
6315457,"The ability of cells from the stromal-vascular fraction of rat brown adipose 
tissue to develop into adipocytes in primary cell cultures was investigated. 
Comparison was made with precursor cells isolated by the same procedure from the 
white adipose tissue of the same animals and cultured in parallel under 
identical conditions. The culture procedure used allowed the cells isolated from 
both tissues to rapidly proliferate and differentiate. During the first week in 
culture the brown fat cells grew to confluence and accumulated fat in a 
multilocular way. During the second week, further fat was accumulated, but the 
cells remained multilocular. Analysis of the parallel white fat cell cultures 
revealed clear differences between the two adipocyte types, although the rates 
of cell growth were identical. Measurement of the size of the cellular lipid 
inclusions as a function of the time in culture indicated a much higher number 
of fat droplets larger than 30 micron in the white adipocytes. Moreover, after 
isolation of pelleting fractions of both cultured cell types, comparative 
functional analysis of their mitochondria by oxygen consumption measurement, as 
well as direct cytochrome-c-oxidase determinations, showed a significantly 
higher amount of mitochondria in the brown fat cell fractions than in the white 
fat cell fractions. It was concluded that mature brown fat contains precursor 
cells which can proliferate and develop into adipocytes in monolayer cell 
culture and which have inherent characteristics distinct from those of white fat 
precursor cells."
6318439,"Cycloleucine, a competitive inhibitor of methionine transferase was used to 
generate in vivo partially methylated mRNA in SV40-infected BSC-1 cells. 
Cycloleucine at 0.5 mg/ml causes more than a 30% decrease in internal m6As of 
late SV40 mRNA with only minor effect on the dimethyladenosine of the 5' caps 
m7GpppmAm. After treatment with 2 and 5 mg/ml of cycloleucine, internal m6As 
were reduced by 10- and 100-fold, respectively. The inhibition of BSC-1 mRNA 
methylations paralleled that observed for late SV40 mRNAs. In cells exposed to 2 
mg/ml cycloleucine production of late SV40 mRNA was inhibited by 80% whereas the 
amount of SV40 nuclear RNA was only slightly reduced. Size fractionation of SV40 
nuclear RNA from cycloleucine-treated cells revealed a loss of SV40 19 S RNA 
with a corresponding increase of fragmented RNA sedimenting between 11 to 5 S, 
so that the total amount of SV40 RNA in the nucleus was almost unchanged. 
Analysis of viral transcription complexes from cells treated with cycloleucine 
indicated that SV40 transcription was not affected by cycloleucine. 
SV40-transformed cells, in contrast to BSC-1 cells, were able to process and 
transport undermethylated RNA. When transformed cells were treated with 2 mg/ml 
cycloleucine no changes in quantities or size of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA 
were detected. The data argues for a role of internal m6A moieties in modulating 
the processing-linked transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of 
nontransformed cells. Transformed cells may escape these controls due to 
structural alterations in their perinuclear regions."
6323017,"The gene TOP2 encoding yeast topoisomerase II has been cloned by immunological 
screening of a yeast genomic library constructed in the phage lambda expression 
vector, lambda gt11. The ends of the message encoded by the cloned DNA fragment 
were delimited by the Berk and Sharp procedure (S1 nuclease mapping) for the 5' 
end and mapping of the polyA tail portion of a cDNA fragment for the 3' end. The 
predicted size of the message agrees with the length of the message as 
determined by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The identity of the gene was 
confirmed by expressing the gene in E. coli from the E. coli promoter lac UV5 to 
give catalytically active yeast DNA topoisomerase II. Disruption of one copy of 
the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that 
the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function."
6327972,"The effects on ventricular myosin isoenzyme expression of naturally occurring 
and synthetic thyroid analogs (3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine, 
3,5,3'-D-triiodothyronine, 3,3',5'-L- triiodothyronine , 
3,5,3'-L-triiodothyroacetic acid and 3,5-L-diiodothyronine), catecholamines and 
high carbohydrate diets have been studied in thyroidectomized and 
hypophysectomized rats. Also, the effects on myosin isoenzyme expression of 
adrenalectomy and hydrocortisone replacement have been studied in euthyroid 
animals. Myocardial CO2 production and hepatic alpha-glycerolphosphate 
dehydrogenase activity were measured to monitor the effects of these 
interventions on tissue respiration. The results indicate that there was no 
significant separation between the actions of thyroid analogs on metabolic 
parameters and myosin isoenzyme patterns. However, high carbohydrate feeding in 
hypophysectomized rats increased the isoenzyme V1 from 12% to about 36% of total 
myosin; partial replacement with 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine and fructose feeding 
had synergistic actions. In thyroidectomized rats, feeding a high carbohydrate 
diet increased the V1 form from undetectable levels to about 28% of total 
myosin; partial 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine replacement had an additive effect. 
Beta adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol and blockade with propranolol did 
not affect myosin isoenzyme expression. Adrenalectomy in euthyroid rats caused a 
33% decrease in the V1 form and a corresponding increase in the V3 isoenzyme, 
which could be reversed by treatment with hydrocortisone. Thus, thyroid analogs 
do not selectively stimulate myosin isoenzyme expression as compared with their 
effects on energy production. Furthermore, the results suggest that the 
mechanism for regulation of cardiac myosin isoenzymes may involve a primary 
signal related to dietary carbohydrate, which is modulated by thyroid hormone, 
and possibly glucocorticoids."
6328061,"We studied the effects of increased-dose radiation therapy in terms of survival 
time and improvement in the quality of life in 50 glioblastoma patients with 
minimal residual tumors. 1) Intraoperative radiotherapy ( IOR , 1,000-2,000 rad) 
was applied in 13 cases; the 2-year survival was 41.6%. However, in 9 patients 
who had undergone macroscopic total removal the 2-year survival rate was 68.6%. 
2) Wide resection with necrotomy after conventional external irradiation was 
used in 9 cases and conformation irradiation was added; their 2-year survival 
was 44.4%. 3) In 22 patients who received only conventional irradiation 
following surgery, the 2-year survival was 7.5%."
6328745,"Influenza virus gene 8 codes for two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) which 
are translated, respectively, from a colinear and an interrupted mRNA. To 
investigate the mechanism of transcription processing by splicing, cloned 
full-length NS DNA was inserted into the late region of an SV40 vector. In this 
manner, transcription of NS RNA from the recombinant initiates and terminates 
using SV40 control sequences. RNA mapping and sequence analysis showed that the 
RNA transcripts are processed to produce both the spliced and unspliced NS mRNAs 
in approximately equal abundance. The junction sequence of the spliced mRNA is 
identical to that of NS2 mRNA found in influenza virus-infected cells. In 
addition, another mRNA species was found to contain a chimera splice between 
SV40 and NS sequences. Both NS1 and NS2 polypeptides are produced in the 
recombinant-infected cells as predicted from sequence analysis. These studies 
establish that during influenza virus infections processing of the NS1 mRNA 
transcript undergoes a mechanism of splicing similar to that occurring with 
DNA-directed RNA transcription."
6329444,"The effect of cerebral ischemia and subsequent recirculation on the nuclear 
thyroid hormone receptors was investigated. Ischemia was produced by occlusion 
of the right common carotid artery in the Mongolian gerbil. The thyroid hormone 
receptors were measured in vitro by a [125I]triiodothyrorine (T3) binding assay 
with isolated nuclei and Scatchard analysis. A rapid increase of the total 
number of binding sites for T3 appeared within 30 min of ischemia and reached 
over 40% by 3 h. During the same 3-h period, the relative binding affinity was 
reduced by 25%. Upon recirculation after 30 min or 3 h of ischemia, a rapid 
reversal of measured T3 binding sites occurred, which progressed to 20-30% below 
the control value by the recirculation period of 3 h. If the ischemic period was 
only 30 min, the nuclear T3 binding capacity recovered toward the control level 
and the affinity constant returned normal after recirculation for 24 h. When the 
ischemic period was extended to 3 h, there was progressive loss of receptor 
sites, and no tendency for recovery of the affinity constant was observed. These 
results demonstrated a prompt alteration of a specific nuclear regulatory 
component in cerebral ischemia, which may indicate the importance of such 
changes within the nuclear regulatory mechanism for reversibility of cerebral 
function following ischemic insult."
6342420,"Despite the increased attention that the syndrome of pseudodementia is 
receiving, several important questions regarding diagnostic criteria and 
accuracy, etiology, and even the appropriateness of the term itself remain 
unanswered. The author reviews the literature on this topic, including published 
case reports. On the basis of the available data, it appears that there may be 
at least two categories of pseudodementia and that the cognitive impairment 
associated with depressive illness is more appropriately viewed as a 
depression-induced organic mental disorder. Directions for future research are 
suggested."
6342739,"Initial adjuvant immunotherapy trials have demonstrated a greater disease-free 
interval in patients treated with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) compared with 
historical controls. In this study 149 patients at high risk of recurrence after 
surgical treatment of local or regional malignant melanoma were given BCG for 2 
years and were followed up for a median of 28 months from the start of 
immunotherapy. The 36 patients in the comparison group had a higher rate of 
recurrence than the patients treated with BCG, and the rate in the treatment 
group was close to that reported from a similar study at the University of 
California at Los Angeles. The relatively long disease-free interval for the 
high-risk comparison patients in this study suggests that the control groups at 
other centres may have included patients with unrecognized additional risk. The 
rates of survival in the Canadian treatment group were also comparable to those 
reported by other centres. However, reports of a favourable BCG-mediated pattern 
of recurrence could not be confirmed. Therefore, the routine use of adjuvant BCG 
immunotherapy is not recommended."
6347619,"Drugs may interact with warfarin through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms. Examples of the former include alteration of the bioavailability of 
vitamin K by antibiotics, mineral oils or cholestyramine; oestrogens, diuretics 
and hypolipidaemic agents such as clofibrate may influence vitamin K-dependent 
clotting factor synthesis, and drugs which affect haemostasis, e.g. via platelet 
function, will enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Pharmacokinetic 
interactions are better understood. Few drugs have been shown to alter warfarin 
absorption, the importance of protein binding displacement has been exaggerated, 
and since warfarin is not eliminated to any extent unchanged by the kidney, the 
most important kinetic interactions are those due to inhibition or induction of 
its hepatic metabolism. Isomeric differences in metabolism form an important 
basis for stereoselective metabolic interactions, especially inhibition; this 
has been demonstrated with phenylbutazone, metronidazole and co-trimoxazole. 
Enzyme induction, although recognised for many years, may still pose problems in 
therapeutics, usually on withdrawal of the inducing agent."
6350992,"This is a report about a 9 year old turkish boy suffering from recurrent 
episodes of high fever caused by Plasmodium vivax-infection (Malaria tertiana), 
12 months after returning from his malarious homeland. After a 3-day course of 
Chloroquin, we administrated Primaquin to eliminate residual extraerythrocyte 
forms of Plasmodium vivax. On the 7th day of treatment acute haemolysis 
developped. This was caused by Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency, 
which could be demonstrated by a red-cell-enzyme analysis. The investigation of 
the patient's whole family showed the typical recessive X-linked inheritance of 
this enzyme-defect. Frequency and clinical manifestations of this defect are 
discussed."
6378042,"The world's first human-to-human heart transplant was performed at Groote Schuur 
Hospital on the 2nd December 1967. Between 1967 and 1973, 10 patients underwent 
orthotopic heart transplantation. Four lived for more than 1 year. The longest 
survivor died after 12 1/2 years, and one patient remains alive and fully 
employed 11 1/2 years after transplantation. Since 1974, 44 patients have 
undergone heterotopic heart transplantation, whereby the donor heart is inserted 
in parallel with the recipient's own heart. Four of these patients have 
undergone retransplantation for acute or chronic rejection. Survival has been 
almost 60% for 1 year, falling to 21% by 5 years. The major complications of 
heart transplantation have been early acute and late chronic rejection; 
immunosuppression has been complicated by a high incidence of infection, 
particularly during the first year, and by a 10% incidence of the development of 
malignant tumors. A portable hypothermic perfusion system has been developed to 
store and transport donor hearts for periods of up to 24 hours."
6381762,"Despite effective treatment of existing tumors, patients with bladder cancer 
remain at risk of developing new tumors. Effective immunotherapy may lower that 
risk. To test this hypothesis, mice that had survived transitional cell 
carcinoma (MBT2) transplantation with the aid of bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
immunotherapy were randomized and tested for long term protective immunity 
against bladder carcinoma. Fifty-one tumor-free mice that had survived tumor 
challenge 10 to 15 months previously were randomized into 3 groups to receive 
intradermal tumor .noculation and intraperitoneal levamisole, intralesional Tice 
strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or intralesional saline. Fifteen previously 
unchallenged animals also received tumor and intralesional saline. All 3 groups 
of survivors had less tumor growth (p less than 0.01) than nonsurviving 
controls. Even among survivors, additional bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
immunization, but not levamisole treatment, significantly inhibited tumor growth 
(p less than 0.01). A 2nd experiment compared 22 nonimmune mice, 21 mice 
preimmunized intravenously with 300 micrograms of bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell 
walls, and 18 mice that had survived MBT2 by 8 months after live bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin treatment. Nonimmune and survivor groups were randomly 
subdivided into saline or treatment groups. Cell wall-preimmunized mice were 
divided into matching groups according to footpad response to purified protein 
derivative. The cell-wall preimmunized and nonimmune mice received the 
immunostimulant P3+Re-glycolipid or the carrier solution alone. The group of 
survivors received either intralesional saline or live bacillus Calmette-Guerin. 
Both bacillus Calmette-Guerin and saline-treated groups had significantly less 
tumor growth (p less than 0.001) than nonsurviving controls. Animals treated 
with P3-Re-glycolipid (with or without preimmunization with cell wall) did not 
differ from nonsurviving control. Footpad response to purified protein 
derivative did not correlate with tumor growth in these mice. Our results 
suggest that intralesional bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy can afford 
long term protection from transplanted bladder cancer, and that live bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin is superior to levamisole and P3 + Re-glycolipid + bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin cell walls in the treatment of bladder cancer."
6422832,"The effect of a surgical stress on serum TSH, T4, free T4, T3, rT3 and TBG was 
measured before, during and after a coronary bypass operation. Precautions were 
taken to age, sex, pre-operative nutritional state, anamnestic illness, pre- and 
post-operative medication. Compared to the pre-operative period TSH increased 
during operation and normalized at the first post-operative day, while only 
minor alterations for total and free serum T4 were observed. T3 and rT3 declined 
at the start of extracorporal circulation, T3 remained reduced during the 
post-operative period, while rT3 reached its pre-operative value at the first 
post-operative day. It is concluded that the coronary bypass operation evokes a 
rapid decline in T3, which is not normalized by the TSH induced response of the 
thyroid gland, while the post-operative period is characterized by a ""low T3 
state"". The clinical relevance of this finding is discussed with respect to the 
cardiovascular and the nutritional state of the patients in the post-operative 
period."
6431778,"Five cases are presented to demonstrate the computed tomographic (CT) spectrum 
of holoprosencephaly. The classifications of alobar, semilobar, and lobar types 
A and B holoprosencephaly are each represented, with an additional case of 
semilobar holoprosencephaly complicated by a subdural effusion."
6432557,"The ability of bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, to enhance dopamine (DA) 
synthesis in retinas of rats 1, 4, 7, 15 and 60 days after eye opening was 
assessed and compared to the time course of postnatal development of the 
light-induced increase in DA synthesis. The accumulation of 
dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino 
acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. In 
dark-adapted rats, neither bicuculline nor light enhanced DOPA accumulation 1 
day after eye opening, but on the remaining days either treatment significantly 
augmented DA synthesis, and by day 15 the effects were as great as those 
observed in adult retinas. At each time point, the magnitude of the drug effect 
on DA synthesis in the dark was similar to that observed following light 
exposure. These results suggest that an endogenous GABAergic input to the DA 
neurons appears at the same time as the acquisition of the dopaminergic response 
to light. The effect of bicuculline treatment on DA synthesis in light-exposed 
animals was also assessed. At 4 and 7 days the drug significantly enhanced DOPA 
accumulation over that produced by exposure to light alone, but on later days 
bicuculline exerted no such additive effect. These data imply that early in the 
maturation of the light response mechanisms other than removal of an inhibitory 
GABAergic tone may be partially responsible for excitation of the DA neurons."
6437857,"Basic aspects and recent advances in the understanding of the pharmacological 
mechanism of action of the clinically most used antiparkinson drugs are 
reviewed. Recent human and animal biochemical investigations clearly confirm and 
extend previous findings indicating that benserazide is much more potent than 
carbidopa as peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. L-DOPA in combination with 
benserazide or carbidopa constitutes the best available therapy for Parkinson's 
disease (PD). To reduce peaks and rapid fluctuations of L-DOPA plasma levels 
(possibly responsible for peak-dose dyskinesias and end-of-dose deterioration) a 
slow-release formulation of L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or with 
benserazide plus catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors should be developed. In 
parkinsonian patients under long-term L-DOPA therapy monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors type B (MAO-B) e.g. (-)deprenyl and direct dopamine receptor agonists 
(bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide etc.), due to their L-DOPA-sparing effects, 
alleviate in some cases L-DOPA-induced side-effects e.g. dyskinesias and on-off 
phenomena. However, since (-)deprenyl, due to its metabolism to 
(-)methamphetamine and (-)amphetamine, seem to have indirect sympathomimetic 
activity, new selective MAO-B inhibitors devoid of indirect sympathomimetic 
effects should be tested clinically to assess the functional role of pure MAO-B 
inhibition in the therapy of PD. The auxiliary therapy with direct dopamine 
receptor agonists of the D-2 subtype represents another valid approach which 
should be further investigated in order to find novel dopamine agonists, less 
expensive than bromocriptine, and strictly selective for D-2 receptor sites."
6439824,"A double-blind crossover trial was conducted of thyrotropin releasing hormone 
treatment in six patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Patients received 
4 mg of thyrotropin releasing hormone intramuscularly daily during the two-week 
treatment period. Although three patients reported subjective improvement, 
objective evaluation failed to demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness of 
thyrotropin releasing hormone in this dosage."
6442343,"The nature of mutant acid alpha-glucosidase (AAG) in muscle was studied in 6 
patients with Pompe disease, consisting of 2 each of the infantile, childhood 
and adult types. Anti-human liver AAG rabbit antibody prepared in the present 
study was confirmed to be monospecific by immunodiffusion, immunotitration and 
immunohistochemical methods. It was found by the immunodiffusion and enzyme 
immunoassay methods using this antibody that the mutation produced a normal 
amount of enzyme protein but the latter was an inactive form, suggesting 
structural gene mutation in 5 of the 6 cases. In the remaining childhood type 
case there was no detectable amount of enzyme protein, suggesting that the 
mutation causes a reduction in the amount of the enzyme protein or synthesis of 
unstable enzyme protein. Similarly, the enzyme activity of AAG was markedly 
reduced in all patients, but that of neutral alpha-glucosidase was the least 
reduced in the adult type, medium in the childhood type, and the most reduced in 
the infantile type."
6445538,"Gamma-ray irradiation introduces single and/or double strand breaks into the DNA 
molecule of the cells. In the case of mammalian cells, these breaks are being 
repaired in general during the first hr following exposure to ionizing 
radiation. The article reports on the results obtained from testing the ability 
of cultured lymphocytes from patients with Down's syndrome to repair 
radiation-induced DNA single-strand breaks. The ability to repair was deduced 
from the study of the DNA sedimentation profiles in alkaline sucrose gradients. 
It was found that lymphocytes from Down's syndrome patients are less efficient 
in repairing single-strand DNA breaks than are lymphocytes from normal 
individuals. This significantly increased fraction of unrepaired DNA strand 
breaks might be associated with the unusually high level of radiation-induced 
chromosome aberrations as compared with normals."
6446987,"The causes of sudden and unexpected death in 29 highly conditioned, competitive 
athletes, ages 13-30 years, are summarized. Sudden death occurred during or just 
after severe exertion on the athletic field in 22 of the 29 athletes. Structural 
cardiovascular abnormalities were identified at necropsy in 28 of the 29 
athletes (97%), and in 22 (76%) were almost certainly the cause of death. The 
most common cause of death in this series was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which 
was present in 14 athletes. Other cardiovascular abnormalities that occurred in 
more than one athlete were anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the 
right (anterior) sinus of Valsalva, idiopathic concentric left ventricular 
hypertrophy, coronary heart disease and ruptured aorta. Cardiac disease was 
suspected during life in only seven of the 29 patients, and in only two of the 
seven was the correct diagnosis made clinically. Hence, in this series of young 
athletes, sudden death was usually due to structural cardiovascular disease, and 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was a frequent cause of sudden death; 
atherosclerotic coronary heart disease was relatively uncommon."
6453959,"Coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a preventable occupational disorder of the 
respiratory system resulting from exposure to and retention of respirable coal 
dust. It exists in two distinguishable forms: simple, which is seldom if ever 
disabling, and complicated, also known as progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), 
which is sometimes totally disabling and is associated with a high mortality 
rate. The disease affects a small proportion of active U.S. miners, and only a 
very small number develop PMF. In its more advanced stages, the disorder is 
characterized by shortness of breath. Scientific criteria for diagnosis are well 
established but are not followed in the U.S. because of Federal law and 
regulation. However, an acceptable scheme for classification of chest 
radiographs exists. Black lung benefits payable to miners, their survivors and 
dependents are approaching $2 billion annually, and regulations concerning 
eligibility for such benefits are intentionally slanted to make it possible for 
claimants to receive benefits in a manner not consistent with regulations 
governing similar payments to other occupationally employed persons or in 
accordance with established medical criteria."
6458983,"The authors examined the soluble proteins of the brain frontal lobes in the 
newborn with trisomias of the 13th, 18th, and 21st chromosomes (Down's, Patau's, 
and Edwards' syndromes). The examinations were carried out on autopsy material 
(the post-mortem period not exceeding 24 hours) by the method of disc 
electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The brain tissue was taken from 17 
newborn infants with Down's syndrome; 9 infants with Patau's syndrome; and 7 
infants with Edwards' syndrome. For the control the brain of 21 newborn infants 
without defects of the CNS development (the death cause being analogous) was 
taken. In all the syndromes studied diversely directed but relatively specific 
shifts were revealed on the proteinograms. It was the albumin section which 
appeared to be the most sensitive to the chromosomal pathology: in cases of 
Down's and Patau's syndromes the protein content in it was reduced, whereas in 
cases of Edwards' syndrome it was increased. In the latter syndrome the relative 
amount of neuronines S-5 and S-6, and in Patau's syndrome the amount of 
neuronine S-6 were lowered, this lowering being statistically significantly. In 
all the trisomias a tendency to a diminution of the zone of the acidic 
neurospecific cerebral proteins was noted. This is, possibly, due to the lower 
level of the CNS functional activity in chromosomal pathologies."
6461592,"Ankylosing spondylitis is a disease with clinically and radiologically very 
variable features. It is the intention to direct the attention from the old by 
orthopedists' influenced association of the stiff back to the polymorphism of 
the disease especially to the early stages which still frequently are recognized 
too late. The paper deals with the nosology, the various states of the clinical 
course with the numerous radiological criteria including therapeutical 
approaches."
6465810,"Benign hypertrophy of the masseter muscle is an uncommon entity important in the 
differential diagnosis of head and neck masses, particularly a unilateral mass

summarized."
6475068,"The association of optic nerve hypoplasia and deficiency of the septum 
pellucidum and hypopituitarism is known as the De Morsier syndrome or 
septo-optic dysplasia. Four children with blindness and growth retardation due 
to growth hormone deficiency are described. Frequent recurrent episodes of 
severe hypoglycaemia, starting in the newborn period, were observed in three of 
them. Although visual impairment was noted during the first year and growth 
failure was detected between the first and sixth year of life in all four 
patients, the diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia was delayed for two to six 
years. Early diagnosis and treatment with growth hormone should prevent attacks 
of hypoglycaemia and their sequelae and bring about normal growth."
6478055,"The translation of polyadenylated and of non-polyadenylated RNA obtained from 
lactating rat mammary gland was almost totally inhibited by 0.5 mM 
7-methylguanosine-5'-phosphate in the wheat-germ cell-free system. This 
inhibition was maintained during the preparation of the 9S whey-protein mRNA and 
of the 12S and 15S casein mRNAs. Chemical decapping of these mRNAs caused a 
similar reduction of their activity. Although a large fraction of milk-protein 
mRNAs have been reported to lack 3'-polyadenylation, these results show that the 
mRNAs in the mammary gland do contain a 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine cap."
6481730,"Marfan's syndrome is a hereditary disorder of connective tissue, involving the 
ophthalmic, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. Two cases are described 
in which protrusio acetabuli was a major problem. Otto pelvis should be

6488562,"An acute illness (Jamaican vomiting sickness) which affected two adults after 
eating unripe ackee fruit was investigated. Analyses of serum and urine samples 
were performed to compare the patterns of organic acidaemia and aciduria with

that the toxic ackee constitutent, hypoglycin, produces essentially the same 
metabolic effects in adults as in children."

6495304,"The McKusick-Dungy-Kaufman syndrome is characterized by hydrometrocolpos, 
polydactyly and congenital heart disease. Two of these 3 main symptoms should be 
present for the diagnosis. Associated anomalies are mainly found in the 
urogenital tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the skeletal system. On the 
basis of 2 patients and the literature the clinical features and the genetic 
aspects of this syndrome are reviewed. The clinical variability and the severity 
of the syndrome are stressed. Evidence for an autosomal recessive inheritance is 
given. Because of the clinical variability it seems preferable to use the term 
complex rather than syndrome."
6496438,"Nonpenetrating cardiac injuries due to direct precordial blunt impacts are a 
commonly encountered phenomenon in medicolegal offices. These injuries vary from 
contusions to valvular lacerations, or papillary muscle rupture to coronary 
arterial injury with resulting infarction. A less commonly occurring 
manifestation of nonpenetrating injury is a concussion of the heart (commotio 
cordis), often with dramatic physiological consequences but no morphologic 
cardiac injury. We describe four case reports of this entity. The cases were 
collected over a 5-year period (1978-1983) from the Wayne County Medical 
Examiner's Office in Detroit, Michigan."
6499637,"Because onset of autonomic neural dysfunction in the diabetic syndrome has not 
been well established, sensitive and quantitative measures of autonomic nervous 
system (ANS) function were made in 19 non-insulin-dependent (NIDD) and 14 
insulin-dependent (IDD) recent-onset diabetic subjects. The known duration of 
diabetes mellitus in the NIDD subjects was less than or equal to 12 mo. The 
duration in the IDD subjects was less than or equal to 24 mo. RR-variation 
during beta adrenergic blockade (an index of an ANS reflex involving the cardiac 
parasympathetic nervous system [PNS] pathway) was smaller than that of control 
subjects in both NIDD (P less than 0.001) and IDD subjects (P less than 0.01). 
This PNS abnormality was not likely to be due to volume depletion since acute 
volume depletion induced by furosemide in six normal subjects (1608 +/- 105 ml, 
mean +/- SEM) did not change RR-variation. Dark-adapted pupil size after topical 
PNS blockade (an index of iris sympathetic nervous system [SNS] activity) was 
also smaller in both groups of diabetic subjects (NIDD, P less than 0.01; IDD, P 
less than 0.05). Pupillary latency time (an index of an ANS reflex involving 
iris PNS pathway) was prolonged in the NIDD subjects (P less than 0.005) but was 
not significantly altered in the IDD subjects. Thus, it would appear that the 
ANS is impaired soon after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. We hypothesize 
that early impairment of the ANS is common in IDD and NIDD subjects. This 
finding is consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal carbohydrate metabolism 
is an important factor in the etiology of diabetic autonomic neuropathy."
6502174,"Twenty-three children (aged less than 18 years) and 17 adults with severe 
widespread dystonia were treated with high doses of benzhexol (up to 130 mg 
daily introduced slowly over many weeks). Children tolerated higher doses 
(median 30 mg/day) than adults (median 20 mg/day). 52% of the children gained 
useful benefit, many (43%) without unwanted side effects. Such an approach was 
less successful in adults; 41% gained benefit, but only 35% had no side effects. 
Twelve adults with severe axial dystonia, and two children with life-threatening 
generalised dystonia were treated with a combination of a low constant dose of 
tetrabenazine to which were added pimozide and benzhexol as necessary. The dose 
of tetrabenazine was aimed at 75 mg daily; pimozide was increased (6 to 25 
mg/day) until the dystonia was relieved or Parkinsonism and other side-effects 
prevented further increments; if necessary benzhexol (6 to 30 mg/day) then was 
added to control side-effects and to provide additional benefit. 75% of the 
adults with severe axial dystonia, and one of the two children with life 
threatening generalised dystonia gained useful benefit from this regime. It is 
concluded that high dose benzhexol is the present first treatment of choice for 
children with severe dystonia, and is worth a try in adults but with less 
expectation of success. When benzhexol treatment alone fails in adults with 
severe disabling axial dystonia, or in children with life-threatening 
generalised dystonia, combined therapy with tetrabenazine, pimozide and 
benzhexol may give valuable symptomatic relief."
6502196,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant cerebellar tumor seen primarily in the pediatric 
age group that has a known ability to metastasize extraneurally. The skeleton is 
the most common site of extraneural metastases, but metastases to the bone 
marrow can also occur. Four cases of medulloblastoma metastatic to the marrow 
are reported. In addition, 31 cases from the medical literature are reviewed. 
Clinical features include bone tenderness, cytopenias and elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Skeletal involvement, 
especially of the pelvic bones, is frequently seen radiographically. Weight 
loss, soft tissue masses and a requirement for blood transfusion are also 
associated features. Marrow biopsy specimens are characterized by the presence 
of a small cell tumor often with fibrosis, necrosis and osteoblastic activity. 
The symptomatic response to chemotherapy is rapid, but chemotherapy resistance 
appears quickly. Only 1 in 4 cases diagnosed antemortem in this review lived for 
more than a year. We conclude that marrow aspiration and biopsy are indicated in 
the evaluation of patients with medulloblastoma and may serve to diagnose the 
cause of cytopenias, to verify extraneural spread and to provide prognostic 
information."
6504703,"The interaction of two water-soluble furocoumarins, 8-(omega-diethyl 
aminopropyloxy)psoralen hydrochloride (I) and its 5-isomer (II), with DNA has 
been investigated by spectroscopic, equilibrium dialysis, hydrodynamic and 
chiroptical techniques. Both compounds intercalate into the polynucleotide 
double helix. From the dependence of the binding on ionic strength, ion release 
and binding free energy corrected for counterion release have been 
quantitatively estimated. It is shown that the differences in DNA-affinity 
observed for compounds I and II arise primarily from non electrostatic 
contributions. The binding process is exothermic, with slightly different van't 
Hoff enthalpies for the examined furocoumarins. Helix lengthening and dichroic 
effects indicate different intercalation geometries for the isomeric compounds. 
These studies allow a possible explanation for the finding that isomer I 
exhibits largely better DNA-photobinding properties, while isomer II is by far 
more effective as an antiviral agent."
6509920,"Homogenates of the placental tissue of near term sheep were separated by 
differential centrifugation into mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosolic 
fractions. The relative proportions of the major neutral lipids and 
phospholipids, together with their fatty acid compositions, were determined in 
the homogenates and in each subcellular fraction. The cytosolic fraction 
contained the highest proportion of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and these possessed 
a fatty acid composition markedly different from the total CEs extracted from 
the homogenate. Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained 
significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the 
mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition 
characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the 
microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. These results are compared with 
those obtained from other mammalian tissues, both ruminant and non-ruminant, and 
discussed in terms of the function of the components of the subcellular 
fractions."
6572942,"We investigated the genomic distribution of mouse and human repeated sequences 
by assessing their relative amounts in the four major components into which 
these genomes can be resolved by density gradient centrifugation techniques. 
These components are families of fragments that account for most or all of 
main-band DNAs, range in dG + dC content from 37% to 49%, and are derived by 
preparative breakage from long DNA segments (greater than 300 kb) of fairly 
homogeneous composition, the isochores. The results indicate that the short 
repeats of the B1 family of mouse and of the Alu I family of man are most 
frequent in the heavy components, whereas the long repeats of the BamHI family 
of mouse and of the Kpn I family of man are mainly present in the two light 
components. These results show that the genomic distribution of repeated 
sequences is nonuniform and conserved in two mammalian species. In addition, we 
observed that the base composition of two classes of repeats (60% dG + dC for 
short repeats; 39% dG + dC for long repeats) is correlated with the composition 
of the major components in which they are embedded. Finally, we obtained 
evidence that not only the short repeats but also the long repeats are 
transcribed, these transcripts having been found in mouse poly(A)+ mRNA."
6575436,"Ameloblastoma is a locally invasive, histologically nonmalignant tumor that may 
on very rare occasions give rise to metastases. A patient with a mandibular 
ameloblastoma presenting typical histologic appearances developed a pulmonary 
metastasis confirmed by histology as arising from the primary tumor. Two groups 
of these extremely rare malignant ameloblastomas can be distinguished: those 
without histologic signs of degeneration that give rise to metastases identical 
to the primary lesion, and those with degenerative signs provoking metastases 
with the histologic appearance of undifferentiated carcinoma. No relation 
appears to exist between size of primary tumor, histologic type of 
ameloblastoma, or its course and tendency to produce metastases."
6578216,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is associated with plasma lipoproteins and is important 
in modulating the catabolism of remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. ApoE 
is a polymorphic protein, and homozygosity for the E2 allele is associated with 
type III hyperlipoproteinemia. A variant of apoE, apoEBethesda, was found that 
migrates in the E1 position on isoelectric focusing. Evaluation of the proband 
and her family showed that both individuals with apoEBethesda had type III 
hyperlipoproteinemia, and the analysis was consistent with the concept that 
apoEBethesda was coded by a new E allele and that this allele was expressed in a 
codominant fashion. The discovery of apoEBethesda and its association with type 
III hyperlipoproteinemia provides additional evidence for the genetic 
heterogeneity of the E allele and suggests that a number of different structural 
mutations of the E apolipoprotein may be associated with the type III phenotype."
6583309,"Three patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and Parkinson's disease are 
reported. The recognition of this association is important because these two 
entities require specific therapeutic approaches. The presence of Parkinson's 
disease does not preclude an excellent response of the hydrocephalus to a 
shunting procedure. Although several reports of cases with the characteristic 
clinical manifestations of normal pressure hydrocephalus--progressive dementia, 
gait difficulty and urinary incontinence--have been published earlier, it was 
Adams and Hakim who emphasized the clinical triad and the effect of shunting the 
cerebrospinal fluid as a means of treatment. Messert and Baker stressed that the 
gait disturbance had a close resemblance to the freezing gait of parkinsonism. 
We are reporting three patients who had both conditions. Recognition of the 
existence of both disorders in the same patients is important since appropriate 
treatment of each of them led to marked improvement of their symptoms."
6589575,"The burning mouth complaint of each of fifty-seven patients was thoroughly 
studied. Psychogenesis was found to be the most frequent cause, followed by 
geographic tongue and moniliasis. Multiple causative factors, such as 
psychogenesis and moniliasis and psychogenesis and geographic tongue, were found 
in some patients. The purely psychogenic group was composed mostly of 
postmenopausal women. The tongue and palate were the most frequently affected 
sites. There were some similarities among patients in the geographic tongue and 
psychogenesis groups. A diagnostic protocol for patients with burning mouth is 
described."
6592581,"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) residues, which are found internally in viral and 
cellular mRNA populations at the sequences Apm6ApC and Gpm6ApC, have been 
proposed to play a role in mRNA processing and transport. We have developed a 
sensitive approach to analyze the level and location of m6A in specific purified 
cellular mRNAs in an attempt to correlate m6A location with function. 
Polyadenylylated mRNA is hybridized to cDNA clones representing the full size 
mRNA under study or fragments of it, and the protected RNA is digested and 
labeled with polynucleotide kinase in vitro. After enrichment for m6A with 
anti-m6A antibody, the [32P]-pm6A is separated on TLC plates, and compared with 
the total amount of radiolabeled nucleotides. Using this combination of in vitro 
RNA labeling and antibody selection, we were able to detect m6A in purified 
stable mRNAs that cannot be readily labeled in cells with greater sensitivity 
than was possible by previous techniques. We applied this technique to bovine 
prolactin mRNA and showed that this mRNA contains m6A. Moreover, all of the m6A 
residues in this message are found within the 3' two-thirds of the molecule and 
are highly concentrated (61%) within a sequence of 108 nucleotides at the 3' 
noncoding region of the message. The nonrandom distribution of m6A in a specific 
cellular mRNA, as demonstrated for bovine prolactin, will have to be taken into 
account when designing a model for m6A function."
6600702,"Vision screening tests within the limits of industrial medicine examinations, 
together with physical examinations, were done on human individuals by means of 
pseudo-isochromatic charts in order to detect ""red-green blindness"". The tests 
were carried out on 1589 individuals (males and females) from 10 medium-scale 
plants of the Saarbrücken area (Federal Republic of Germany). The results 
obtained from male individuals by 919 Ishihara-tests were only considered, 
categorized and graphically represented according to their age groups. The data 
have been collected from the cases examined mostly between the years 1976 to 
1977. About 1500 cases were examined per year. Because the samples were not 
selected at random, one has to be cautious with regard to the statistical 
interpretations of the results. However, due to the large number of cases 
included in the study, it can be statistically represented. The histogram 
illustrating the distribution of colour-vision deficiency, according to each age 
group, shows the highest peak at an age range of 30 to 35 years. This indicates 
that a considerable number of cases with colour-vision deficiency was discovered 
late. The individuals have to be early examined by school physicians, house 
physicians, occupational physicians, internists or ophthalmologists with this 
colour-vision screening test, before they enter professional life. Some 
symptomatical complexes of internal diseases and human genetics, i.e. related to 
""colour-vision blindness"" are also emphasized hemophilia and hemolytic anemia 
due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency."
6605224,"The finding of peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding capacity, supposed to be a marker 
of immature lymphocytes, within the T-cell population of the human thymus (58%) 
and tonsil (10%) prompted the comparison of maturation stages of PNA binding 
(PNA+) and nonbinding (PNA-) T cells in both organs. The proliferative response 
after mitogenic stimulation of purified PNA+ fractions was significantly less 
than that of purified PNA- fractions. The results of mitogen dose-response 
experiments, of variation in time of culture harvest, and of addition of 
irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood non-T cells indicated the intrinsic 
mitogen unresponsiveness of cells in the PNA+ fractions. The mitogen response of 
tonsil fractions was higher than that of thymocyte fractions. Cells with an 
immature immunologic phenotype were enriched in the thymocyte PNA+ fraction, and 
almost absent in the tonsil fractions. Both tonsil fractions contained cells 
with the immunologic phenotype of mature T cells, and showed a purine 
interconversion enzyme makeup comparable to mature T lymphocytes. It is 
concluded that the tonsil PNA+ T cell is a functionally immature lymphocyte 
which is in a further maturation stage than PNA+ or PNA- thymocytes. The 
presence of PNA+ T cells outside the thymus is of relevance for the clinical 
evaluation of PNA binding assays and suggests the occurrence of T-cell 
maturation within the tonsil environment."
6612271,"The majority of viral meningitis cases is known to be due to ECHO virus 
infections on one hand, and mumps on the other. While the latter can be 
diagnosed by IgM antibody detection from one serum sample in the acute stage, 
diagnosis of enterovirus infections is by virus isolation and typing. An 
IgM-antibody test for ECHO 9 and 11 viruses is presented to evaluate the 
possibility of rapid serological diagnosis of ECHO virus meningitis cases. 36 
cases from five local outbreaks due to ECHO 6, 9, 11, and 30 viruses were 
characterized by virus isolation and serum neutralization tests. All sera (88 
samples) were assayed by a MACRIA (M-antibody capturing radioimmunoassay) to 
ECHO 9 and 11 viruses. While sera from all ECHO 9 and 11 cases, when taken at 
appropriate times, had IgM antibodies to the infecting type, a varying degree of 
cross-reactivity could be observed. Specificity problems are discussed in 
comparison with isolated cases of enteroviral infections due to different types, 
including Coxsackie B viruses."
6613471,"Mondor's disease is a superficial thrombophlebitis of the thoracic wall 
frequently affecting the female breast. In most cases the etiology is unknown, 
although operation, direct and indirect trauma, are known as causative factors. 
This material comprises five women, all with Mondor's disease of the breast. One 
patient did not return for follow-up, in one patient biopsy was performed after 
2 weeks. In the remaining three patients the lesion had disappeared after 9 and 
10 weeks. Mondor's disease has no relationship to cancer or systemic disease, 
and no treatment apart from observation is required."
6620327,"Two problems relating to segregation analysis for Wilson's disease are discussed 
and a practical solution is presented. A problem in the ascertainment of 
families with Wilson's disease is illustrated by comparing segregation ratios 
calculated by the single selection, complete truncate, and multiple incomplete 
selection methods. The effect on the segregation ratio of exclusion from the 
analysis of those sibs who had died of other diseases at a young age is also 
discussed and a method of adjustment of the number of the affected using the 
data on age at onset is proposed. The segregation ratio by multiple incomplete 
selection (Weinberg proband method) after adjustment for those sibs who had died 
of other diseases was 0.243, consistent with the theoretical value for autosomal 
recessive inheritance. The segregation ratio calculated by the single selection 
method tended to give a lower value, while that calculated by the complete 
truncate method was greater than the theoretical value. Recessive inheritance 
is, however, supported. The actual effect of exclusion of those sibs who had 
died of other diseases on gene frequency estimation is shown to be very small."
6620854,"The effects on growth, body composition, and metabolism of a protein-restricted 
diet supplemented with essential aminoacids, the calcium-ketoacids of valine, 
leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine, and the calcium-hydroxyacid of 
methionine, were investigated in seven growth-retarded children with chronic 
renal failure. During 0.4 to 1.0 years of treatment there were significant 
increases in growth velocity and upper arm circumference SD scores, body cell 
mass (intracellular water calculated as tritium space minus corrected sodium 
bromide space) and serum transferrin. Blood urea and urea:creatinine ratio fell 
in all children. Renal function assessed from plasma creatinine and 51Cr EDTA 
clearance did not change significantly. During treatment there was an increase 
in plasma calcium, high levels necessitating brief interruption of therapy in 
two children, and a decrease in plasma phosphate. Levels of serum parathormone 
fell in all children, and were correlated inversely with plasma calcium and 
positively with plasma phosphate. Abnormalities compared to control children in 
blood aminoacid and branched-chain ketoacid levels were unaffected by treatment. 
These results suggest that a protein-restricted diet supplemented with essential 
aminoacids and calcium-keto and hydroxyacids may be useful to improve linear 
growth and nutritional status in children with chronic renal failure, and that a 
reduction in hyperparathyroidism may be partly responsible for some of the 
beneficial effects observed."
6622345,"A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal 
stridor. Other than urinary frequency and urgency, not uncommon in this 
condition, and postoperative levodopa-sensitive postural hypotension, there were 
no features of generalized autonomic failure. The laryngeal stridor responded to 
levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously."
6622440,"""Product sampling"" is an effective marketing strategy which lowers consumer 
buying resistance by providing a free sample of the product for the consumer to 
test. We used this strategy to demonstrate the palatability of the prudent diet 
(30-35% of calories from total fats, less than 10% from saturated fats, less 
than 3 g sodium, and increased fiber) to physicians attending a 5-day family 
practice continuing medical education conference. The effect of the intervention 
was evaluated with pre- and postintervention questionnaires and a 20% random 
sample of participants was surveyed 1 year later. The proportion of physicians 
who reported that they considered the diet to be ""very palatable"" rose from 26% 
before the demonstration to 64% after the demonstration. Only 5% of the 
physicians did not report a favorable response to the demonstration. Sixty-two 
percent of the physicians reported that the diet was better than expected, and 
82% reported that the demonstration encouraged them to recommend the diet to 
their patients. One year after the intervention 60% considered the diet ""very 
palatable"" and 55% reported that the demonstration stimulated them to increase 
their dietary intervention activities. These data suggest that serving the 
prudent diet at continuing medical education programs helps to remove prejudices 
about the diet and encourages physicians to recommend the diet to their 
patients."
6626051,"Injury is sustained by isolated hearts on repletion with calcium after a short 
period of perfusion with calcium-free medium at 37 degrees. A possible mechanism 
for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-fre medium removes 
extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On 
calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Since lanthanum 
is known to displace calcium from extracellular pools in heart, it was used in 
an attempt to modulate the injury of the calcium paradox. The presence of 10 
microM lanthanum in the calcium-free perfusion fluid was found to inhibit 
totally protein release normally produced by subsequent calcium exposure. When 
lanthanum was added after the calcium-free period and before calcium repletion, 
protein release was only partly prevented. This shows that a change in membrane 
properties occurred during the calcium-free perfusion period which could be 
prevented, but not reversed, by the addition of lanthanum."
6633857,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated 
extracranial, symptomatic abnormalities in only a minority of cases. The class 
of brain defects known as holoprosencephaly represents a continuum usually 
divided into three types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar. Each has both 
distinctive radiological characteristics and some similarities. Typical facial 
anomalies are found in the severe forms. Absent septum pellucidum and 
septo-optic dysplasia, possibly of similar embryological origin, have some 
resemblances to lobar holoprosencephaly, but are clinically and radiologically 
separate in most instances. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, which is 
superficially like holoprosencephaly, should not be confused with the 
prosencephalic defects."
6642091,"Available evidence indicates that poor metabolic control and raised blood 
pressure each accelerate the development of diabetic microangiopathy. 
Microangiopathy is associated with excess albumin deposition in capillary 
basement membranes and it has been suggested that increased extravasation of 
plasma constituents may lead to basement membrane thickening. We measured the 
transcapillary escape rate of albumin, an indicator of the rate of extravasation 
of intravascular albumin from the circulation per unit time, following 
intravenous injection of 125I-human serum albumin. We examined the independent 
effects on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin of non-ketotic poor 
metabolic control, hypertension and microangiopathy. We studied non-diabetic 
control subjects and diabetic patients, initially when in non-ketotic poor 
metabolic control and again when control had been improved. We also studied 
normotensive well-controlled diabetic patients without microangiopathy, 
normotensive well-controlled diabetic patients with microangiopathy, 
hypertensive well-controlled diabetic patients without microangiopathy and 
hypertensive well-controlled diabetic patients with microangiopathy. The 
transcapillary escape rate of albumin was similar in non-diabetic control 
subjects (5.5 +/- 0.7%/h) and in both Type 1 (5.3 +/- 1.2%/h) and Type 2 (5.1 
+/- 0.6%/h) normotensive diabetic patients without long-term complications. 
During poor metabolic control the transcapillary escape rate of albumin was 
significantly higher than in non-diabetic subjects (8.8 +/- 0.8%/h and 5.5 +/- 
0.7%/h respectively, p less than 0.01). With improved control values fell 
significantly to 6.3 +/- 0.9%/h (p less than 0.02), not significantly different 
from control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6685828,"Between the years 1968 and 1979, 87 cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis 
(SSPE) appeared among the Israeli-born population. The incidence of SSPE dropped 
sharply in 1977, 10 years (the median age at onset of SSPE) after introduction 
of mass antimeasles vaccination, and remained low in 1978 and 1979. Most of the 
SSPE cases reported measles at an age significantly younger than that of the 
general population. This pattern did not change after introduction of 
antimeasles vaccination. Incidence was significantly lower (p less than 10(-9) 
in the vaccinated population than in the unvaccinated population. Occurrence of 
SSPE in some children who were vaccinated against measles could be explained by 
incomplete vaccine efficacy, or by older age at vaccination, which allows the 
possibility of prior exposure to measles. There was no indication that measles 
vaccine can induce SSPE."
6686529,"The causes of sudden, unexpected death in highly-conditioned competitive 
athletes are summarized. In the vast majority of young athletes (less than 35 
years of age) sudden death is due to underlying structural cardiovascular 
disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appears to be the most common cause of such 
deaths and may account for about one-half of the sudden deaths in a youthful 
athletic population. Cardiovascular abnormalities that appear to be less 
frequent important causes of sudden death include anomalous origin of the left 
coronary artery from the anterior sinus of Valsalva, ruptured aorta (due to 
cystic medial necrosis), idiopathic concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and 
coronary artery atherosclerosis. Other diseases which are probably particularly 
uncommon causes of sudden death in the young athlete include mitral valve 
prolapse, aortic valvular stenosis, acute myocarditis, QT interval prolongation 
syndromes, hypoplasia of the coronary arteries or sarcoidosis. Cardiovascular 
disease in young athletes is usually unsuspected during life. In only about 25% 
of those competitive athletes who die suddenly is underlying disease identified 
prior to participation and rarely is the correct clinical diagnosis made. In 
contrast, when sudden death occurs in older competitive or recreational athletes 
(over 35 years of age) it is usually due to coronary artery disease."
6699695,"The fine structure of psammoma bodies was examined in four cases of fibroblastic 
meningioma. In general, large numbers of various-sized calcified bodies 
(psammoma bodies) were scattered among the interstitial fibers. In these bodies, 
the smallest calcific site was found in the extracellular membrane-bound matrix 
vesicles, which measured approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mu in diameter. In addition, 
extracellular ""matrix giant bodies,"" with or without hydroxyapatite aggregates 
and measuring up to 3 mu in diameter, were frequently encountered. These bodies 
were apparently invested with single, double, or multiple concentric walls 
averaging nearly 0.1 mu thick. The presumably originated from the neoplastic 
cells as a consequence of cytoplasmic residuals associated with cellular 
degeneration or necrotic cell processes. Hydroxyapatite crystals precipitated 
repeatedly within the bodies. The precipitate may gradually aggregate within the 
bodies, and gather in clusters, resulting in a large psammoma body. Finally, 
collagen fibers around the calcified giant bodies accrued deposits of apatite 
crystals to make a huge psammoma body. These findings suggest that both matrix 
giant bodies and matrix vesicles may serve as initial nidus of calcification of 
psammoma bodies in fibroblastic meningioma. Consequently, this mineralization 
process may represent a certain dystrophic calcification of meningocytic cells."
6717095,"Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) 
and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of 
cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, 
as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher 
cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and 
diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin); in fatty acids, variable changes, with a 
predominant increase in the 16:0 in most phospholipids except cardiolipin, and 
sporadic increase in the longer chain (20:0, 24:0) fatty acids in cardiolipin; 
decreased unsaturation index for most phospholipids but increased for 
cardiolipin. These results are tentatively interpreted as indicative of an 
aging-related decrease in fluidity and energy transduction of mitochondrial 
membrane in the heart of aged rats and may be responsible, in part, for the 
decrements in cardiac function with aging."
6726718,"A 9-year-old boy with systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) 
presented with fever and chest pain and rapidly developed pericarditis and 
cardiac tamponade. Despite corticosteroid treatment and pericardiocentesis, 
rapid deterioration necessitated the emergency placement of a pericardial 
window. This is the first reported instance of this type of emergency surgical 
intervention for JRA. Of 220 children with JRA followed for 12 years (7% 
systemic onset), 8 had evidence of acute pericarditis but no other had definite 
evidence of tamponade."
6727432,"Two cases of Haemophilus influenzae type B pericarditis are presented which 
demonstrate the major clinical features and sequelae of this serious illness. 
These cases are analyzed together with 77 others from the literature to 
characterize the clinical features, natural history, and optimal therapy. H. 
influenzae pericarditis is an increasingly frequent disease of young children. A 
mild prodromal illness is often followed by rapid progression of cardiac 
compromise until death ensues, unless pericarditis is diagnosed and treated 
appropriately. The development of cardiomegaly in a febrile patient with a 
Haemophilus infection is an indication for echocardiography, which is diagnostic 
of the pericardial effusion. Initial cultures of pericardial aspirates will be 
positive in 75% of cases even when antibiotic therapy has been initiated. Use of 
appropriate parenterally administered antibiotics, in combination with early 
surgical pericardial drainage or partial pericardiectomy, should minimize 
morbidity and mortality and prevent acute constrictive sequelae."

6728549,"The Currarino triad is a unique complex of congenital caudal anomalies including 
anorectal malformation, sacral bony abnormality, and presacral mass. The usual 
symptomatology is constipation due to anorectal stenosis. Contrast enema and 
computed tomographic myelography are the imaging modalities of choice for 
diagnostic confirmation and clarification of the anomalies. The clinical 
features, unique radiologic appearance, and importance of a correct diagnosis of 
the Currarino triad are reviewed."
6734434,"Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is an unquestionably effective anticancer agent for 
many types of tumors, including advanced breast cancer. However, cardiotoxic 
effects of the drug have limited its use. Methods of reducing or preventing 
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been suggested, including an 
investigational doxorubicin analog, mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ). Mitoxantrone 
was developed to reduce the cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin while 
maintaining effective antitumoral effects. Initial reports suggested that 
mitoxantrone might lack cardiotoxic potential; however, recent studies indicate 
that the drug can produce adverse cardiac effects (congestive heart failure), 
perhaps with similar frequency to that observed with doxorubicin. It is doubtful 
that mitoxantrone will be a significant advance over doxorubicin if direct 
comparative studies reveal a similar incidence of cardiomyopathy."
6739588,"Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare, generalized disorder of connective tissue 
manifested by short stature, brachymorphia, and spherophakia. Inheritance is 
autosomal recessive. In the less than 50 reported cases, joint stiffness in the

in which release of multiple trigger fingers and bilateral carpal tunnel 
syndrome in childhood has improved hand function in a brother and sister."
6742871,"Fifty seven children with dermatitis herpetiformis, 18 from Finland and 39 from 
Hungary, were studied. Diagnostic criteria included the finding of granular IgA 
deposits in the skin of all patients. The mean age at onset of the rash was 7 X 
2 years and favoured sites were the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Symptoms 
suggesting small intestinal disease were rare but in 35 (61%) of the children 
subtotal villous atrophy and in 16 (28%) partial villous atrophy were found on 
jejunal biopsy. Eighteen children underwent a second biopsy after a mean of 21 
months on a gluten free diet; villous height was found to be increased and the 
intraepithelial lymphocyte count decreased in all these patients. Gluten 
challenge caused a reversal in the two children who underwent a third biopsy. 
The effect of the gluten free diet on the rash was examined in Finnish children 
by observing the daily requirements of dapsone, a drug used to control the rash 
at the beginning of the diet. Eight (67%) of the 12 children were able to stop 
taking dapsone after a mean of 11 months on the diet and all three patients 
treated with diet alone became asymptomatic after three to 6 months on the diet. 
These results confirm that most children with dermatitis herpetiformis have 
jejunal villous atrophy, though they rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms. The 
central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the 
fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and 
controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal 
biopsy."
6743105,"The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare condition characterized by the 
triad of familial relapsing peripheral facial palsy, facial edema, and lingua 
plicata. Within a well-documented family aggregate of MRS, an index case 
simultaneously demonstrated all the elements of the triad, as well as gingival 
changes similar to those of cheilitis granulomatosa. When the incomplete or 
oligosymptomatic forms are considered, the MRS may be more common than 
previously thought."
6743144,"The distribution and number of Peyer's patches (5) in two species of marsupial 
mice, Antechinus swainsonii and Antechinus stuartii was found to be the same 
even though the length of the intestine in the latter species was half that of 
the former. Both species lack a caecum and appendix. The position of the Peyer's 
patches is unusual in that the first three Peyer's patches are on the right side 
of the small intestine whereas the penultimate and ultimate Peyer's patches are 
large, contain many lymphoid follicles and are in an anti-mesenteric position in 
the small intestine and sometimes in the large intestine (ultimate Peyer's 
patch). The number of Peyer's patches in eutherian mice of similar size, and 
intestinal length is greater (13) although the number of Peyer's patch lymphoid 
follicles per centimeter intestine is less (1.8) than in A. swainsonii (4) and 
A. stuartii (4.4). Marsupial mice have most of their lymphoid follicles confined 
to a few large Peyer's patches, whereas eutherian mice have fewer lymphoid 
follicles per unit intestinal length, more Peyer's patches (with fewer lymphoid 
follicles) evenly distributed along the intestine and more single lymphoid 
follicles interspersed between them."
6746835,"A new method using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical 
detection (HPLC-ED) for the simultaneous determination of monoamines, their 
precursor amino acids, and related major metabolites in small samples of brain 
tissue weighing from 0.5 to 50 mg is described. The method is based on the 
preliminary isolation of monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and 
serotonin), their precursor amino acids (tyrosine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, 
tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan), and their major metabolites 
(3-methoxytyramine, normetanephrine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 
homovanillic acid, vanillylmandelic acid, 
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) by 
chromatography on small columns of Amberlite CG-50 and Dowex 50W, and by ethyl 
acetate extraction. All the compounds in the four isolated fractions were 
measured by HPLC-ED on a reversed-phase column under four different conditions. 
The sensitivity was from 0.1 to 40 pmol, depending on the substances analysed. 
This newly established method was applied to the study of the effects of an 
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (NSD-1015) and a monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor (pargyline) on the levels of monoamines, their precursor amino acids 
and their major metabolites in brain regions of mice."
6752882,"Moschcowitz syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare disorder 
with a poor prognosis. This syndrome is characterized by a microangiopathic 
hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms and renal disease. 
The vascular lesion consists of disseminated hyaline thrombi in the 
microvasculature composed mainly of platelet aggregates. The mechanisms are 
still poorly understood and are probably multiple. Recent data focus on an 
abnormal endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin and the presence of a factor (or 
the reduction of its inhibitor) in plasma able to induce intravascular 
disseminated platelet aggregation. The most efficient therapy seems to be 
infusions of fresh plasma with or without plasma exchange."
6756339,"Clinicians commonly observe upper extremity signs and symptoms which result from 
median nerve entrapment and can develop at multiple sites along this nerve. 
Median nerve entrapment may occur at the distal humerus when the rarely present 
ligament of Struthers connects an anomalous bony spur of the humeral shaft to 
its medial epicondyle. The pronator syndrome refers to compromise of the median 
nerve in the proximal forearm region. This may result from entrapment between 
the 2 heads of the pronator teres, between the pronator teres and the flexor 
digitorum sublimis, or by the lacertus fibrosus extension from the biceps 
tendon. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve is subject to 
compromise near its origin. As a motor nerve it produces signs of weakness as 
indicators of anterior interosseous syndrome. This syndrome usually occurs 
spontaneously, but can be caused by fractures and fibrous bands. The carpal 
tunnel is a narrow fibro-osseous tunnel through which the median nerve passes 
with 9 tendons. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common of the median nerve 
entrapments. Its causes are many: anything which increases the volume of the 
tunnel contents or decreases the size of the tunnel. Electrodiagnostic 
abnormalities exist more frequently when this entrapment is present than for 
other median nerve entrapments. Anatomic variations of the median nerve occur 
frequently and may lead to diagnostic confusion if not recognized. Successful 
diagnosis and treatment of median nerve entrapment syndromes require awareness 
of possible involved sites and detailed knowledge of related anatomy."
6757467,"A randomized controlled prospective evaluation of intravesical and percutaneous 
bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy was done in 57 patients with transitional 
cell carcinoma of the bladder. In addition, 9 patients at high risk for tumor 
recurrence were treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin produced a self-limited 
cystitis and 1 complication (hydronephrosis) of immunotherapy was observed. Of 
the 57 randomized patients 54 were followed for 3 to 30 months. Tumor recurrence 
was documented in 13 of 26 controls (50 per cent) and only 6 of 28 patients (21 
per cent) treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (p equals 0.027, chi-square). 
The interval free of disease was prolonged significantly with bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin treatment (p equals 0.014, generalized Wilcoxon test). 
Importantly, a simple purified protein derivative skin test distinguished those 
patients who responded to bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy from those who 
did not. Only 1 of 17 treated patients (6 per cent) whose purified protein 
derivative test converted from negative to positive had tumor recurrence 
compared to 5 recurrences (38 per cent) among the 13 patients whose test 
remained negative or had been positive before treatment (p equals 0.022, 
chi-square). Bacillus Calmette-Guerin was given to 10 patients with stage B 
transitional cell carcinoma who were not candidates for cystectomy and 7 are 
free of disease. Of 5 patients with carcinoma in situ 3 remain free of tumor 
after bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment and 5 of 6 who had multiple recurrences

thrombocytopenia, neurological symptoms and renal involvement. The vascular 
lesions consist of hyaline microthrombi, predominantly made up of platelet 
aggregates, disseminated in the smaller vessels. The physiopathological 
mechanisms are still poorly understood and probably multiple. Recent studies 
have demonstrated abnormalities in the endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin,

intravascular disseminated platelet aggregation. The latest therapeutic attempts 
suggest that the most effective treatment probably is fresh plasma transfusions 
associated or not with plasma exchanges."
6760901,"High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of 
metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected 
with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria. 31P-NMR was used to 
quantitate levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in whole cells as a function of the 
degree of parasitemia and yielded good agreement with the results of enzymatic 
assays. The time-dependence of 31P metabolites was monitored in both normal and 
infected erythrocytes, greater rates of decay of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate being 
observed in malarial blood which correlate with the level of parasitemia. Very 
high metabolic rates of infected cells render measurement of intracellular pH 
unreliable on freshly drawn whole blood. When appropriate measures are taken to 
avoid this complication, no difference is observed in the intracellular pH of 
parasitized and non-parasitized erythrocytes from infected animals. In both 
normal and parasitized mice the intraerythrocytic pH is more acidic than that of 
the suspending medium by 0.15 pH unit at 25 degrees C. Unlike free-living 
protozoa, the parasitic protozoan Plasmodium does not contain detectable levels 
of phosphonates or polyphosphates, in either whole cells or perchloric acid 
extracts thereof."
6760914,"The RNA genome of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) is transcribed in vitro 
into complementary DNA and RNA by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA 
polymerase, respectively, from Escherichia coli. In vitro synthesis of 
complementary RNA produces distinct transcripts larger than unit length thus 
reflecting the in vivo mechanism of viroid replication. The influence of varying 
experimental conditions on the transcription process is studied; actinomycin D 
is found to drastically reduce complementary RNA synthesis from the PSTV RNA 
template by RNA polymerase."
6769152,"The Fitz-Hugh--Curtis syndrome is an extragenital manifestation of gonorrhea, 
characterized by fibrinous inflammation of the subphrenic area with 
violinstring-like adhesions between the liver surface and the parietal

differential diagnosis to other abdominal emergencies (cholecystitis, peptic 
ulcer disease etc.) may be difficult, because it will not always be possible to 
isolate the causative agent from the external genitals. In such cases only a 
laparoscopic approach will allow a correct diagnosis. Two case reports are

6775242,"Three cases with unusual manifestations of phakomatosis are reported. The first 
two had clinical symptoms of neurofibromatosis but CT disclosed nodular

6817377,"Small doses of apomorphine (AP, 31.25-125 micrograms/ kg IP) induced 
dose-dependent catalepsy in rats. However, unlike the stereotyped behavior 
induced by high doses of AP which has a rapid onset and is short-lasting, the 
cataleptic effect induced by small doses of AP was evident 30 min after AP 
injection and was unusually long-lasting. Further, AP (31.25-125 micrograms/kg) 
administered 60 min before methamphetamine was found to significantly antagonize 
the methamphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior. Pretreatment with molindone 
(0.45 and 0.8 mg/kg IP), in doses reported to selectively block the presynaptic 
DA receptors, not only decreased the cataleptic effect of AP but also reversed 
the AP antagonism of methamphetamine stereotypy. The results suggest that small 
doses of AP induce catalepsy and antagonize methamphetamine stereotypy probably 
by an action at presynaptic DA receptor sites."
6819159,"Thermogenin is the purine-nucleotide binding polypeptide in brown adipose tissue 
mitochondria (Mr 32 000) which confers upon these mitochondria the ability to 
produce heat. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to 
demonstrate and quantitate the occurrence of thermogenin antigen in small 
amounts of tissue, and thus to characterize different depots of fat tissue as 
white or brown. The extreme sensitivity of the method allows determination of 
thermogenin in samples equivalent to less than 1 mg tissue. The results indicate 
that thermogenin seems to be exclusively localised in brown fat mitochondria (as 
compared to white fat, liver or heart muscle mitochondria), and thermogenin 
antigen could only be found in brown adipocytes (as compared to white 
adipocytes). Thus, brown and white adipose tissue are probably ontogenetically 
different."
6823106,"Isolated perfusion of the heart with a Ca2+-free perfusate followed by a 
Ca2+-containing perfusate causes dramatic alterations in the physiology and 
biochemistry of the tissue, a phenomenon known as the calcium paradox. A similar 
paradoxical effect of Ca2+ has also been reported to occur in the kidney. In 
this study an attempt was made to reproduce the calcium paradox in canine 
kidneys and to characterize more fully its metabolic consequences. Canine 
kidneys were perfused with Krebs-Henseliet bicarbonate buffer free of Ca2+ for 
30 min followed by perfusion with Ca2+ (1.5 mM). Unlike previously reported 
results no sudden decrease in flow was there a Ca2+-related sharp rise in rate 
of release of lactic dehydrogenase. In addition, we found no significant change 
in the level of tissue adenine nucleotides or functionality of isolated 
mitochondria. It is concluded that there is no calcium paradox in canine kidney 
under these conditions and it is suggested that the Ca2+ paradox may be 
characteristics only of muscle tissue that can undergo Ca2+-dependent 
contraction."
6823113,"A case of heterochromia iridis and Horner's syndrome is reported in a 7-year old 
girl with paravertebral neurilemmoma. These clinical findings can be useful in 
the early diagnosis of mediastinal tumors in the paravertebral axis. While 
typically associated with neuroblastoma, these findings can be due to tumors 
which are inately benign--in this case neurilemmoma. The mechanism for 
heterochromia is briefly discussed."
6829791,"Male Wistar rats prelabeled with tetracycline to mark surfaces of bone and tooth 
formation-mineralization were placed into orbit for 18.5 days aboard the Soviet 
COSMOS-1129 Biosatellite. They were injected with tetracycline for a second and 
third time on the 6th and 27th days, respectively, after recovery of the 
Biosatellite. Spaceflight did not alter the rate of periosteal bone formation in 
the non-weight-bearing ribs and regions of the mandibles, which were covered by 
masticatory muscles. Bone formation-calcification rates were impaired at those 
sites in the jaw that had no contiguous muscle (molar region). The remodeling 
activity on the alveolar bone around the buccal roots of the molar teeth was 
significantly reduced but without creating a negative balance between formative 
and resorptive activities. Total Ca, P, and hydroxyproline concentrations in the 
jaws, incisors, and ribs were normal after spaceflight, but gravity density 
fractionation studies indicated that in the jaws alone, O-G conditions caused a 
delay in the maturation of bone mineral and matrix. A 29-day postflight recovery 
period at earth's gravity was sufficient to fully correct these anomalies. 
Relative to tooth formation, relatively normal circadian and infradian 
biorhythmic periodicities of Ca and P in dentin and enamel were maintained 
during spaceflight. We conclude that most of the non-weight-bearing bones of the 
rat skeleton are at risk to the effects of hypogravity."
6830166,"The results of cerebrospinal fluid agarose gel electrophoresis in 300 
consecutive patients were correlated with neurological examinations and 
diagnoses, other cerebrospinal fluid studies, and the results of evoked 
potential examinations. The presence of oligoclonal bands was the most sensitive 
test for multiple sclerosis (MS); bands were present in from 100% (11/11) of 
patients with definite MS to 82% (27/33) of those with possible MS (classified 
by McAlpine criteria). The visual evoked response was the next most sensitive 
study. Thirty-eight patients without MS or related disorders had bands in the 
IgG region. Three patients had plasma cell dyscrasias. Seven patients had thick 
single bands. Single bands did not correlate with chronic polyneuropathy but 
appeared to be an artifact of storage. Twenty-eight patients had active 
neurological disease, including cerebral infarction (in 5), viral infection (in 
4), remote effect of carcinoma (in 4), and acute and chronic polyneuropathies 
(in 6). In acute illnesses (i.e., vascular insults), repeat electrophoresis 
showed disappearance of bands. In continually active disease, bands persisted. 
These results indicate that the presence of oligoclonal bands provides sensitive 
supporting evidence for the diagnosis of MS but that bands may be present in 
other disorders, including those not directly related to infection or abnormal 
immune response. The data suggest that oligoclonal bands may represent an immune 
response to neurological injury that is prominent in disorders with a 
particularly intense or continuous antigenic stimulus."
6834189,"Miller-Dieker syndrome, which includes lissencephaly and a characteristic 
phenotypic appearance, has been reported to have an autosomal recessive pattern 
of inheritance. However, we have found abnormalities of chromosome 17 in two of 
three unrelated patients with this syndrome, one with a ring chromosome 17 and 
the other with an unbalanced translocation resulting in partial monosomy of 
17p13. A review of the literature revealed five additional patients in three 
families, who had Miller-Dieker syndrome and an abnormality of 17p. Thus, we 
propose that monosomy of distal 17p may be the cause of Miller-Dieker syndrome 
in some patients."
6841082,"Based on present publications we review indications of the therapy of dermatoses 
with thalidomide as well as possible mechanisms of action and side effects of 
this drug. In reactional states of leprosy the use of thalidomide is 
established. Further indications are chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, 
prurigo nodularis, and eventually recurrent aphthosis and certain 
photodermatoses not responding to usual treatment. Therapeutical trials of 
thalidomide in diseases in which such a treatment is only occasionally or not at 
all mentioned in the literature will be reported. Concerning the mechanisms of 
action emphasis is put on a possible immunosuppression by thalidomide. Among the 
side effects the thalidomide neuropathy is stressed."
6846512,"The growth of the masseter muscle in eight infant, juvenile, and adolescent 
female rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) was examined over a 2.5 year period using 
serial radiographic cephalometric techniques with the aid of radiopaque muscle 
markers. The radiopaque markers, which are composed of small pieces of root 
canal broach inserted into the muscle belly, make it possible to determine 
longitudinal masseter muscle growth as well as migration of the masseter muscle 
relative to the mandible. It was found that the masseter muscle increased in 
length by 64% during the total growth period, most of which occurred between 6 
and 18 months of age. Relative to the cranium, the masseter muscle grew markedly 
inferiorly and only slightly posteriorly. Relative to the mandible, the masseter 
migrated in a posterior and slightly superior direction, keeping pace with the 
ramus and condyle as they grew posteriorly and posterosuperiorly throughout the 
study period. It was concluded that: 1) radiopaque muscle markers are a valuable 
tool for analysis of muscle growth and alteration of muscle location; 2) the 
masseter muscle in the rhesus monkey undergoes elongation, probably due to 
addition of sarcomeres at the fiber-tendon junctions; and 3) posterior migration 
of the masseter muscle relative to the corpus of the mandible, probably due to 
the nature of its periosteal attachment, results in a stability of the 
anteroposterior position of the masseter muscle despite the anterior 
displacement of the mandible."
6853107,"Experimental amblyopia in animal models causes a reduction of cell sizes in 
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) laminae connected with the amblyopic eye. 
However, direct evidence that the human amblyopic visual system is affected in a 
similar manner has been lacking. Histologic study of the LGNs from a patient 
with ophthalmologically confirmed anisometropic amblyopia shows a decrease of 
cell sizes in the parvocellular layers innervated by the amblyopic eye. This 
decrease was more pronounced in laminae receiving crossed fibers. To our 
knowledge this is the first report about structural alterations in the afferent 
visual pathway of a human amblyope and the data reaffirm the validity of the 
monkey model for further study of the basic mechanisms in amblyopia."
6853716,"We have investigated the molecular basis of hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency in a patient who presented with the 
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A catalytically incompetent form of HPRT has been isolated 
from this patient's erythrocytes and lymphoblasts. This enzyme variant, which we 
have termed HPRTKinston, is indistinguishable from the normal enzyme in terms of 
its intracellular concentration and maximal velocity, but differs with respect 
to its isoelectric point (more basic) and Michaelis constants for both 
substrates (markedly elevated). The tryptic peptides of HPRTKinston were mapped 
by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an attempt to define the 
precise abnormality in its primary structure. Sequence analysis of the single 
aberrant tryptic peptide in HPRTKinston revealed an aspartic acid to asparagine 
amino acid substitution at position 193. Electrophoretic analysis of the CNBr 
peptides of HPRTKinston confirmed the location of the proposed mutation. This 
amino acid substitution can be explained by a single nucleotide change in the 
codon for aspartic acid 193 (GAC leads to AAC). This is the first specific 
mutation described at the molecular level in a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan 
syndrome."
6855804,"Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive 
interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by 
acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled 
trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had 
a moderate but definite effect in the third. Muscle groups graded 4/5 (MRC 
scale)returned to normal; very weak (0-3/5) atrophic muscles, improved to a 
minor degree. In one patient with acetazolamide-resistant paralytic attacks, 
dichlorophenamide also diminished the frequency and severity of the acute 
attacks. Dichlorophenamide had, in the present study, less effect than 
acetazolamide in reducing serum HCO3(-) and elevating Cl-. Its effectiveness may 
be related to the degree of sensitivity of certain HOPP patients to alterations 
of Cl- and/or HCO3(-) serum levels or to a different action of the drug 
unrelated to carbonic anhydrase inhibition or acidosis. Dichlorophenamide should 
be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with 
HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or 
worsened by acetazolamide."
6859058,"Stiff-man syndrome is characterized clinically by fluctuating muscular stiffness 
and spasm, and electromyographically by continuous motor unit activity at rest, 
which is abolished by sleep, general anesthesia, nerve block, curare, and 
several centrally-acting medications. A spinal or supraspinal origin has been 
proposed for this disorder. Some clinical and electrophysiologic features, along 
with an occasional association with encephalopathy, may support a proposed 
supraspinal cause. An elderly man with progressive dementia and concomitant 
development of stiff-man syndrome is described. He had not had stiff-man 
syndrome one year earlier, when he had only mild dementia. An association 
between stiff-man syndrome and dementia has not been previously described. 
Increased muscle tone and muscular rigidity is frequently encountered in 
patients with dementia, however, and pathologic reflexes involving neck and 
proximal musculature have been described in dementia. It is possible that this 
patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, 
and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be 
present with increased incidence in patients with dementia."
6859802,"Bacterial skin infections are important to recognize because we have the means 
to eradicate almost all of them. Primary skin infections are mainly caused by 
staphylococci or streptococci. Staphylococci infections present as furuncles and 
carbuncles, superficial folliculitis, impetigo or rarely the Scalded Skin 
Syndrome. Streptococcal infections present as impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas or 
cellulitis. Corynebacteria causes erythrasma, trichomycosis or pitted 
keratolysis. Gram-negative primary skin infections, although uncommon, may 
occur; bacterial cultures are generally necessary for diagnosis. Secondary 
bacterial infections of pre-existing wounds, burns, dermatitic skin, or 
retention cysts are common events."
6863354,"We used biochemical and clinical variables to develop a method to predict the 
expected duration of independent walking following surgery and bracing in 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Data from the records of fifty 
patients were analyzed by linear and multiple regression. The most useful 
factors, applied in combination, in predicting the duration of walking ability 
after bracing were: percentage of residual muscle strength, vital capacity, 
creatinine coefficient, motivation of the patient at the time of bracing, and 
decrease in creatinine coefficient in the two years prior to bracing. This 
system uses readily available variables to predict the response to bracing in 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Improvement in the criteria for the 
selection of patients for surgery and bracing is important in view of the 
economic cost as well as the demands on the time and energy of these children 
and their parents."
6868876,"Infertility caused by hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea may be complicated by 
pituitary adenoma. In a group of 36 women with 
amenorrhoea-hyperprolactinemia-syndrome were 15 infertility-patients. 10 of them 
had prolactin levels above 100 ng/ml. In 6 patients a prolactinoma was removed 
microsurgically. In every case further treatment was necessary to get normal 
cycles. 8 of these 10 infertility-patients became pregnant."
6879001,"Measles can persist in the central nervous system and cause subacute sclerosing 
panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive disease that is almost always fatal. The 
clinical findings of SSPE include behavioral changes, ataxia, seizures, and 
mental-motor deterioration that begins several years after natural infection 
with the virus. Measles antibody is found in the spinal fluid, and its presence 
is particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis. The mechanisms of 
pathogenesis of SSPE apparently involves the selection of clones of virus, which 
do not replicate to become complete virus particles. These ""suppressed"" viruses 
are able to multiply and spread from cell to cell. The immune system of the 
patient is unable to clear this infection. Several hypotheses are advanced to 
explain these events. Further studies are needed, however, to develop a complete 
understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. Fortunately, SSPE is 
disappearing in the United States. This apparently is related to the widespread 
use of measles vaccines and to the resulting low frequency of natural measles 
infections."
6881176,"To assess the relationship between aging and autonomic nervous system function, 
cardiovascular and pupillary autonomic nervous system reflexes were measured in 
subgroups of 103 normal male subjects ranging in age from 19 to 82 years (mean 
age = 39 years). Both the plasma norepinephrine level, a measure of 
cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system activity, and the mean arterial blood 
pressure increased with age (r = 0.68 and 0.67, respectively, both p less than 
0.001). In contrast, the plasma epinephrine level, a measure of adrenomedullary 
sympathetic nervous system activity, was unrelated to age (r = 0.08, p = NS). 
Respiratory variation of heart rate during beta-adrenergic blockade, an index of 
cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity, was reduced in older subjects 
(r = -0.54, p less than 0.001). Thus, there was evidence of an age-related 
increase of cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system activity and a reduction 
of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity. These findings are 
consistent with the hypothesis that there is sympathetic nervous system and 
parasympathetic nervous system compensation of cardiovascular function in 
response to an age-related decrease in baroreceptor sensitivity. However, 
dark-adapted pupil size during parasympathetic nervous system blockade, an index 
of iris sympathetic nervous system activity, declined with age (r = -0.81, p 
less than 0.001). The latency time for the pupillary response to a light 
stimulus, an index of iris parasympathetic nervous system activity, was 
prolonged in older subjects (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001). Thus, both 
sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the iris 
were diminished in older subjects, findings consistent with the generalized 
decrease of peripheral somatic nerve function that has been reported with aging 
in man. It is concluded that autonomic nervous system function also declines 
with aging, but that other age-related changes such as a decline of baroreceptor 
sensitivity may lead to compensatory autonomic nervous system response, which 
could mask underlying functional defects."
6884360,"A DNA methyltransferase was partially purified from bovine thymus heavy cells. 
The enzyme has Mr 130 000, and introduces methyl groups from 
S-adenosylmethionine into the 5 position of cytosines in DNA. Sequence 
specificity analysis revealed that about 60% of the total methylation occurred 
in the 5'd(C-G)3' doublet. Single-stranded and hemi-methylated DNAs were 
methylated at an elevated rate by the enzyme. The kinetic analysis showed that 
the reaction obeys a random sequential mechanism. These results suggest that the 
enzyme serves primarily as a maintenance DNA methyltransferase."
6887404,"Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients 
with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence. Significant improvement 
or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men 
and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function. The clinical results 
correlated with cystometric reversion to stable bladder function. Patients who 
obtained good results showed improvement in the tested level of psychological 
adjustment, suggesting that psychological factors are not causes of the 
urological problem."
6888541,"When many ligands bind to cell-surface receptors, ligand-receptor complexes are 
internalized via clathrin coated pits by a process called receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. The cytoplasmic fate of ligands internalized within endocytic 
vesicles or endosomes is variable. For example, maternal immunoglobulins are 
transported through the cytoplasm of neonatal intestinal epithelial cells and 
are exocytosed at the basolateral surface. However, other ligands are degraded 
as a result of their delivery to the lysosomal compartment of cells. Although 
the translocation of endosomes to the Golgi region in the cell centre seems to 
be a general phenomenon presumably coupled to ligand degradation by lysosomes 
and endosomes and lysosomes undergo saltatory movements within the cytoplasm, 
the spatial control of interaction between the two structures is not understood. 
To address this problem we have begun to examine the spatial and temporal 
intracellular distribution of endosomes and lysosomes. Utilizing a new 
fluorescent microscopic approach, we have now been able simultaneously to 
visualize endosome and lysosome populations in living cells. Our results suggest 
that a specific relocation of lysosomes is rapidly induced upon binding of 
different types of ligands to the cell surface; this migration of lysosomes to 
the Golgi region of the cell precedes the translocation of endosomes into the 
same area."
6889706,"Myoglobinuria may follow extreme muscular exertion or disorders that cause 
muscle necrosis. Dystonia has not been implicated previously. We studied an 
8-year-old boy of non-Jewish, Mexican-American descent with autosomal-dominant 
dystonia musculorum deformans who developed rapidly progressive and severe 
generalized dystonia, hyperpyrexia, myoglobinuria, and renal failure. 
Curarization was required. Transient improvement was achieved with tetrabenazine 
and baclofen, but bilateral thalamotomy was then performed. Patients with severe 
dystonia should be observed for evidence of myoglobinuria."
6896006,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato plant tissue accepts potato 
spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) RNA as a template for the in vitro synthesis of 
full-length RNA copies of the PSTV genome. Viroid transcription requires the 
presence of Mn2+ and /or Mg2+ ions and is not inhibited by concentrations of 
10(-5) M alpha-amanitin. This is the first report of a well-defined product 
synthesized in vitro by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy plants."
6957649,"Incidence of second primary cancers was evaluated in 7,127 women with invasive 
cancer of the cervix uteri, diagnosed between 1935 and 1978, and followed up to 
38 years (average, 8.9 yr) in Connecticut. Among 5,997 women treated with 
radiation, 449 developed second primary cancers compared with 313 expected 
(relative risk = 1.4) on the basis of rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. 
Excess incidence was noticeable 15 years or more after radiotherapy and 
attributed mostly to cancers of sites in or near the radiation field, especially 
the bladder, kidneys, rectum, corpus uteri, and ovaries. No excess was found for 
these sites among the 1,130 nonirradiated women. The ratio of observed to 
expected cancers for these sites did not vary appreciably by age at irradiation. 
The data suggested that high-dose pelvic irradiation was associated with 
increase in cancers of the bladder, kidneys, rectum, ovaries, corpus uteri, and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but, apparently, not leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, breast 
cancer, or colon cancer."
6966005,"Acute purulent pericarditis is a well-recognized, though infrequently seen, 
manifestation of systemic Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. We recently 
studied two pediatric patients who developed signs of this septic complication 
during appropriate antibiotic treatment for bacteremia. These case reports 
should alert physicians to the possibility that pericarditis may become 
clinically evident in patients with systemic H. influenzae infections many days 
after initiation of appropriate therapy. The pathophysiology, diagnostic 
modalities and therapy are briefly reviewed."
6973391,"Seventeen well-characterized human lung cancer cell lines were examined for the 
presence of specific membrane receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 
nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as for the production of diffusible factors 
capable of stimulating soft agar growth. These cell lines represented all four 
major histological types of human lung cancer including small cell carcinoma of 
the lung (SCCL) and the three types of non-SCCL (epidermoid, large cell, and 
adenocarcinoma). The SCCL lines included three lines referred to as ""converters"" 
because they had lost SCCL morphological and biochemical properties during 
prolonged passage in vitro. Specific receptors for EGF and NGF were detected by 
measuring the binding of 125I-radiolabeled growth factor to the cell surface. 
These assays revealed that EGF receptors are found on five of six non-SCCL cell 
lines and are not found on any of the SCCL lines. In contract, NGF binding was 
detected at low levels on three of eight SCCL lines and on all three SCCL 
converters but was not observed for non-SCCL lines. Thus, SCCL and SCCL 
converter cell lines are distinguished from non-SCCL by the pattern of membrane 
receptors for EGF and NGF. Such differences may ultimately prove useful as 
biological markers for the different histological types of lung cancer. 
Moreover, the majority of SCCL cells and all of the non-SCCL cells tested were 
found to produce diffusible growth factors which can stimulate soft agar growth 
of nontransformed normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Although some correlation 
between soft agar growth factor production and the absence of EGF receptors may 
exist for SCCL cells, the production of transforming growth factors appears to 
be a general property of human lung cancer cells in vitro and is independent of 
EGF receptor expression."
6983935,"One hundred and twenty-two consecutive patients hospitalized for ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) were reexamined. The frequency of clinical signs and results of 
tests for associations are presented. Psoriasis was associated with a distal 
pattern of peripheral arthropathy. Spinal rigidity was predominantly seen in 
males. Males with phalangeal arthropathy exhibited preserved spinal mobility. 
This was the case also when HLA B27 positives and patients who did not have 
psoriasis were considered separately. HLA B27 positive patients in this group 
had frequently experienced acute anterior uveitis. It seems possible that the 
disease in such males is the result of combined predisposition to ankylosing 
spondylitis and psoriatic arthropathy. Hip arthropathy was frequently present in 
males with spinal rigidity. The associations observed confirm that AS is a 
heterogenous group of diseases. The term ""syndrome"" may be suitable for such a 
heterogenous group, and we prefer the term ""Bechterew's syndrome"" as the name of 
this group. When these new findings are added to the previous observations that 
acute anterior uveitis probably is a clinical, sex-influenced characteristic of 
HLA B27 positive Bechterew's syndrome, that HLA B27 negative patients with 
Bechterew's syndrome frequently had psoriasis and were HLA B13 and B17 negative, 
and that psoriasis was frequent in HLA B27 positive patients as well, we 
tentatively conclude that different and interacting genetic mechanisms may be 
involved in the etiology of Bechterew's syndrome."
6984375,"Ear, nose and throat symptoms and signs were studied in 15 patients with 
Kartagener's syndrome: a triad consisting of chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic 
bronchitis with bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. The triad is caused by 
primary ciliary dyskinesia and characterized by absent or considerably reduced 
mucociliary transport. Daily accumulation of secretions in the nose, chronic 
recurrent secretory otitis media and sinusitis occurred in all subjects. 
Characteristically, nasal discharge started at birth or was first detected in 
early childhood. Apparently, the frequency of common colds and of acute purulent 
otitis media was not increased. As primary ciliary dyskinesia can occur without 
situs inversus, knowledge of the typical ENT symptoms is essential for making an 
early diagnosis, which is important for the correct management of the disease. 
While a conservative surgical approach to treatment of the ENT symptoms is 
recommended, early and active treatment of the bronchial symptoms is probably 
important for prevention of further lung damage and development of 
bronchiectasis."
7003354,"The regulation of gene expression was studied, for the Escherichia coli rpoBC 
operon, which includes the genes, rpoB and rpoC, for the beta and beta subunits 
of RNA polymerase, and rplJ and rplL, for the two proteins, L10 and L7/12, of 
the 50S ribosome. The gene organization agrees well with the accumulated 
observations indicating the coordinate synthesis of RNA polymerase and ribosomes 
under various growth conditions for wild-type E. coli cells. On the other hand, 
the differential regulation of the two essential components observed under 
restrictive growth conditions, after addition of various drugs or with certain 
mutants, in particular those carrying mutations in the RNA polymerase genes, was 
found to take place through two novel regulation systems: The transcriptional 
termination at an internal attenuation site and the two autogenous and 
posttranscriptional controls, being specific for the two ribosomal protein genes 
and the two RNA polymerase subunit genes, respectively. The majority of the 
transcription initiated from the promoter rpoP beta terminates at an attenuator 
site between the promoter-proximal rplJL and the promoter-distal rpoBC genes. 
The frequency of the attenuation seems to control the relative level of RNA 
polymerase synthesis to that of ribosomes. The expression of rpoBC genes is 
subject to an autogenous regulation, in which both RNA polymerase holoenzyme and 
alpha 2 beta complex function as regulatory molecules with repressor activity. 
The autogenous regulation was found to operate at post-transcriptional step(s), 
probably at the level of translation. During the study on the regulation of RNA 
polymerase synthesis, we noticed that the rpoBC operon contained another 
autogenous regulation circuit, in which the synthesis of L10 and L7/12 was 
specifically repressed by the L10-L7/12 complex. Molecular mechanisms and 
physiological meanings of the novel regulations are discussed."
7011307,"Though the roles of some specific DNA lesions in the production of chromosomal 
aberrations is clearly established, those of others remain unclear. While the 
study of aberration production in human genetic DNA repair deficiency diseases 
has been extremely rewarding already, eukaryotic repair systems are obviously 
complex, and one is tempted to feel that such studies may have raised as many 
questions as they have provided answers. For example, the ""standard"" sort of 
xeroderma pigmentosum is chromosomally sensitive to ultraviolet light and to 
those chemical agents inducing ultraviolet-type DNA repair. But both it and the 
variant form have been reported to also be sensitive to the crosslinking agent 
mitomycin C in one study [18], implying a common step or steps in the repair of 
pyrimidine cyclobutane dimers and DNA crosslinks. However, just to complicate 
matters, another study of chromosomal aberration production in xeroderma 
pigmentosum cells had found them no more sensitive to mitomycin C than normal 
cells [50]. Similarly, Fanconi's anemia cells, which are chromosomally sensitive 
to crosslinking agents, and appear to be defective in the ""unhooking"" of linked 
polynucleotide strands [15, 16, 49, 51], are reported to be chromosomally 
sensitive to ethyl methanesulfonate as well [29], and to be sensitive to 
ionizing radiation [7, 19, ]0], again implying overlapping repair systems. It 
seems certain that further study of chromosomal aberration production in repair 
deficient cells by agents inducing various DNA lesions will reveal even greater 
complexity in eukaryotic DNA repair systems and their role in chromosomal 
aberration production. Nevertheless, there seems hope, at least, that such 
studies may also ultimately lead to a complete understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms involved."
7013291,"At the beginning of this century the compulsory vaccination and revaccination 
which was legally founded after the introduction of the vaccination by Jenner 
(1796) led to the removal of the smallpox in Europe and Northern America. 
However, up to the sixties in the developing countries of Asia, Africa as well 
as of Southern America and Middle America still fell ill and died of small-pox 
millions of people. Between 1953 and 1973 importations into countries of Europe 
and Northern America took place in 51 cases. In 1959 on the motion of the USSR 
the WHO decided performance of a world-wide eradication programme of small-pox 
which could be led to success with comprehensive personal, material and 
financial support of many countries. Flanking scientific, technological and 
methodical measures were of essential importance. In May 1980 the World Health 
Assembly in Geneva announced in solemn form the world-wide eradication of the 
small-pox and gave recommendations to the member countries for concluding 
measures concerning the small-pox vaccination, the foundation of vaccine 
reserves and the control of the epidemiological situation in the world. Also in 
the GDR the small-pox vaccination in childhood could be abolished."
7015802,"Twenty human meningiomas were examined for IgG and IgM by the direct 
immunofluorescence of immunoperoxidase methods, or both. IgG was conspicuously 
found in and around the blood vessels, whorls, and psammoma bodies. It was also 
clearly present on the cytoplasmic membranes of the tumour cells. On the other 
hand, IgM was seen only within the blood vessels. Significance of these findings 
is briefly discussed including possible humoral immune reactions in regard to 
whorl and psammoma body formation in meningioma."
7016300,"Fifty-one patients with confirmed bladder cancer have enrolled in a prospective 
evaluation of BCG immunotherapy. Following resection of existing tumors, 
patients were stratified according to tumor grade and number of previous 
recurrences and randomly assigned to control or BCG treatment groups. 
Immunotherapy consisted of six weekly administrations of Pasteur strain BCG 
using 120 mg intravesically and 5 mg percutaneously. Immunotherapy side effects 
were minimal and no patient required postponement of BCG treatments. Eleven 
control (46%) compared with five (22%) BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence 
(P = 0.078, chi 2). Prolongation of the disease-free interval with BCG treatment 
was significantly at the P = 0.016 level by Wilcoxon analysis. Four control and 
two BCG-treated patients had multiple recurrences. Comparing total episodes of 
recurrence, nineteen of 79 (24%) control and eight of 85 (7%) BCG group 
cystoscopic examinations revealed tumor (P = 0.006, chi 2). Immunologic 
correlates of response to immunotherapy were not statistically significant since 
only five BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence. However, four of these five 
patients evidenced impaired LIF response to PPD at the time of tumor recurrence, 
and impairment of skin test reactivity and BCG humoral antibody response were 
more commonly seen in this subgroup of patients."
7029293,"A randomized study of 264 children and adults with previously untreated 
localized Ewing's sarcoma of bone was undertaken between 1973 and 1978 by 83 
institutions of three national study groups: Children's Cancer Study Group, 
Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The Intergroup Study 
was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral 
pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide 
(VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and 
metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival 
rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus 
ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of 
disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC 
plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to 
treatment with VAC alone. The addition of ADR or bilateral pulmonary RT to VAC 
was highly advantageous to patients with nonpelvic primaries. Bone and lung were 
the major sites of distant relapse, but the addition of bilateral pulmonary RT 
showed no advantage over that of ADR in reducing the occurrence of lung 
metastases. These recent results should eliminate some of the pessimism that has 
accompanied a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, although distant metastases 
continued to be a major reason for failure in the control of this tumor. 
Survival of these patients can be improved through well-controlled clinical 
trials designed to determine optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and treatment of the 
primary lesion."
7029300,"Marked dissimilarities in the epidemiology of osteosarcoma, Ewing's tumor, and 
rhabdomyosarcoma indicate differences in their origins. A major clue to the 
genesis of Ewing's tumor comes not from defining persons at high risk but from 
the observation that blacks are at unusually low risk. The neoplasm does not 
aggregate in families and is not part of any known syndrome. No environmental 
causes have been identified. By contrast, osteosarcoma may be caused by external 
or internal ionizing radiation, and it aggregated in families with the same 
tumor or with dissimilar tumors and in certain genetic disorders of bone. In man 
and in dogs, the frequency of the neoplasm is related to bone mass and growth. 
Rhabdomyosarcoma of the upper versus the lower limbs seems related to muscle 
mass. Age peaks in the occurrence of the tumor elsewhere vary with the anatomic 
site; head and neck tumors develop in early childhood and urogenital tumors both 
in early years and in adolescence. The sex ratio (male to female) also varies 
with the site affected. Rhabdomyosarcoma aggregates with certain other tumors in 
families and overlaps with osteosarcoma in some of these relationships but is 
distinguished from that tumor by its excessive occurrence in neurofibromatosis."
7084615,"The present study of metronidazole in perineal Crohn's disease includes 26 
patients, and is composed of 17 of 21 patients who were previously reported and 
9 additional consecutive patients. The course of these patients was evaluated to 
determine if the drug could be reduced or stopped, whether or not it continued 
to be effective for prolonged periods, and what long-term side effects were 
encountered. Dosage reduction was associated with exacerbation of disease 
activity in all patients, but in all, the perineal manifestations of disease 
healed promptly when the full dosage of metronidazole was reinstituted. The drug 
could be successfully discontinued in only 28% of those in whom cessation was 
attempted; in those patients whose perineal disease worsened with cessation of 
therapy, rapid healing was achieved if the drug was reintroduced. Sixteen 
patients received metronidazole for at least 12 mo including 7 for 18-36 mo. 
Eight of these 16 patients, including 4 on and 4 off the drug, remain healed; 
the other 8 patients had advanced healing. The only major side effect observed 
was paresthesias. These occurred in 50% of the patients and developed in the 
patients at a mean of 6.5 mo after the onset of treatment. They appeared to be 
dose related and nonprogressive but tended to persist for prolonged periods even 
after discontinuance of the drug."
7085815,"The carpal tunnel, a narrow space closed distally by the anterior annular 
ligament of the wrist, and containing flexor tendons and the median nerve, is 
the most frequent site of tunnel syndromes, compression in the canal leading to 
medium nerve lesion. The carpal tunnel syndrome usually affects women aged 
between 40 and 60 years, and presents typically as parasthesia of the fingers, 
mainly at night, in the regions served by the median nerve, sometimes associated 
with hypoesthesia and difficulty in movements. Motor disorders, particularly 
affecting the thumb, occur during the advanced stages. Electrical tests may 
confirm diagnosis and enable assessment of severity. More than half the cases 
are idiopathic in nature, presenting as hypertrophy of the annular ligament and 
fibrous thickening in the canal, but other forms may be observed including those 
due to wrist injuries, anatomical anomalies, rheumatic affections, or tumours. 
Associated disorders may be Dupuytren's disease, cubital nerve compression in 
Guyon's canal, or nodular tendinitis leading to a trigger finger. Surgical 
treatment is simple and should be employed when medical measures fail. The nerve 
should therefore be liberated if parasthesia persists after two or three local 
corticoid infiltrations. After a wide exploratory incision, the nerve is freed 
along the total length of the canal and up to the distal extremity of the 
forearm. Results are excellent, 98 p. cent of patients being relieved of their 
pain. Persistent motor disorders require surgical intervention before amyotrophy 
and muscle weakness develops."
7110736,"Besides the considerable differences in the intestinal absorption of the 
different antibiotic classes as described in part I of this paper galenic 
preparations and the administration in form of a capsule -- tablet or sirup play 
a major role too. The particle size of antimicrobial drugs in sirup form has to 
be carefully selected. It should not be too small to prevent a rapid decay of 
the substance by gastric acid; if it is too large the dissolution of the 
substance is not fast enough for maximal absorption in the upper intestinal 
tract. Enteric coating, soluble binders, the dissolution time of a tablet are 
other important variables in the absorption of orally administered antibiotics. 
The most important influence on the resorption of orally administered 
antibiotics comes from the patient. Individual variations in the absorption are 
exceptionally high with amoxycillin. Different age groups show considerable 
variations in intestinal absorption which can amount to an extent of a two to 
threefold increase or decrease over the mean. Simultaneous administration of 
food or drugs have significant influences on the absorption of certain 
antibiotics. The pharmacokinetic investigation and bioavailability studies are 
done on healthy young adults. Diseases of the intestinal tract like acute 
diarrhea or malabsorption syndromes influence the absorption of orally 
administered antibiotics to a considerable extent which even renders some drugs 
completely ineffective. In cystic fibrosis the enteral absorption is retarded 
and pharmakokinetic parameters sizably altered."
7110955,"Zieve's syndrome, characterized by jaundice, hyperlipaemia and haemolytic 
anaemia, usually develops in young, chronically alcoholic subjects with enlarged 
fatty liver. Hitherto, the course of the disease was considered favourable in 
most patients, with complete regression of clinical, biological and anatomical 
symptoms. However, the discovery of acute alcoholic hepatitis during repeat 
needle-biopsy of the liver confirms that in some cases steatosis may mask 
hyaline necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Zieve's syndrome therefore is not 
benign but precedes acute alcoholic hepatitis episodes on a normal, fibrotic or 
cirrhotic liver."
7112433,"The descriptive epidemiology of conjoined twinning in the United States was 
investigated using data from the Birth Defects Monitoring Program (BDMP), a 
nationwide congenital malformations surveillance system that monitors discharge 
diagnoses associated with a third of the births in the United States. This is 
the largest recorded series concerning conjoined twins; data were analyzed on 
7,903,000 births monitored by the BDMP in the period 1970-1977. The analysis 
identified 81 sets of conjoined twins, for a crude incidence of 10.25 per 
million births. The most common types of conjoined twins were 
thoracoomphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic 
twins (10%), and craniopagus (6%). Conjoined twins are more common among females 
than males, and in nonwhites than whites. No maternal age effect was found. 
There was no evidence of seasonal or temporal clustering of the cases. The large 
number of conjoined twins who had birth defects that are not obviously linked to 
the conjoining (particularly neural tube defects and orofacial clefts) may 
provide insights into the pathogenesis of birth defects resulting from 
disordered embryonic migration and fusion."
7113187,"Marfan's syndrome in its complete and incomplete forms takes very often a course 
with cardiac complications, predetermining the fate of such patients. The 
incomplete forms often present difficulties for the timely etiological 
elucidation of the cardiac changes leading to a retardation in the prescribing a 
rational regime to the patients and timeliness of the operation treatment. The 
authors' team own observations are reported on 10 patients with Marfan's 
syndrome, one with complete form and nine--incomplete forms, all of them with 
cardiac complications; two with mitral insufficiency, three with aortic 
insufficiency, four with aortic and mitral insufficiency and one with aortic, 
mitral and tricuspidal insufficiency; seven of the patients had aneurysm at the 
initial part of the aorta, manifested to various degrees and one--dysplasia of 
aorta. Rhythm disturbances were found in one of the patients. One of the 
patients underwent operation--prosthesis of mitral and aortic valve--with good 
results. Three of them died of severe total cardiac insufficiency."
7116934,"Cells from patients wtih Fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents 
which are capable of crosslinking DNA. This increased sensitivity can be 
detected both by cytogenetic and flow cytometric methods. An elevated frequency 
of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to 
DNA crosslinking agents, is a general feature of Fanconi's anemia. Information 
about the formation of sister chromatid exchanges in this disease is less 
consistent. Cytogenetic analysis of cells from patients with Fanconi's anemia 
can be compromised by a low mitotic index. This is reflected in an accumulation 
of cells In the G2 phase of the cycle, after exposure to the bifunctional 
alkylating agent, mitomycin C. New methods for differentiating individuals with 
Fanconi's anemia from unaffected individuals should be of empirical use and 
might also facilitate mechanistic studies of this disease."
7124837,"The amniotic band syndrome is a collection of fetal malformations associated 
with fibrous bands that appear to entangle or entrap various fetal parts in 
utero, leading to deformation, malformation, or disruption. This syndrome is 
given many names yet follows a clearly defined clinical pattern. Misdiagnosis 
and inappropriate family counseling are chronic features. This article reviews 
the clinical features of the amniotic band syndrome, its epidemiology, and the 
status of prenatal and neonatal diagnosis. The spectrum of malformations 
associated with amniotic bands is summarized and illustrated. Major etiologic 
theories are examined. It is recommended that the clinician involved in the 
delivery of any infant manifesting elements of this unusual combination of 
defects seek specialized consultation in the pursuit of an accurate and precise 
diagnosis and appropriate genetic counseling."
7125242,"Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. Possible 
correlation between testosterone and estradiol serum levels after 
testosterone-enanthate substitution, estrogen receptors in tumor tissue and 
clinical symptomatology are discussed. The various theories of etiology 
concerning breast cancer in this syndrome are reviewed. The increased conversion 
of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible 
for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. The current way 
of treatment is described."
7139628,"We questioned mothers of 209 young brain tumor patients and mothers of 209 
controls about experiences of possible etiological relevance which they had 
during pregnancy or which their children had while growing up. Long-suspected 
brain tumor risk factors such as head trauma and X-rays appeared to be factors 
for relatively few cases. Increased risk was associated with maternal contact 
with nitrosamine-containing substances such as burning incense (odds ratio, 3.3; 
p = 0.005), sidestream cigarette smoke (odds ratio, 1.5; p = 0.03), and face 
makeup (odds ratio, 1.6; p = 0.02); with maternal use of diuretics (odds ratio, 
2.0; p = 0.03) and antihistamines (odds ratio, 3.4; p = 0.002); and with the 
level of maternal consumption of cured meats (p = 0.008). These drugs contain 
nitrosatable amines and amides, and the cured meats contain nitrites, chemicals 
which are precursors of N-nitroso compounds. We propose a hypothesis that brain 
tumors in these young people are related to in utero exposure to N-nitroso 
compounds and their precursors, the most potent nervous system carcinogens known 
in experimental animals."
7161484,"Partial spinal cord ischaemia was induced in dogs, ranging from 1 to 3 years of 
age, by ligature of the abdominal aorta just below the arteria coeliaca. The 
changes of the lumbal sensitive ganglia neurons were studied. In addition to the 
most often occurring changes, e.g., the vacuolization of the mitochondria, the 
disaggregation of ribosomes, the dilatation of the Golgi complex, the 
microtubular formations in the dilated cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum 
were observed. Modified cisterns of the granulated endoplasmic reticulum (GER) 
occurred focally in relatively well preserved neurons. The individual 
microtubules measured about 24 nm in outer diameter, and their walls were formed 
by some subunits."
7214933,"A patient with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome had a lifelong history of spatial 
disorientation and visual-spatial cognitive defects demonstrated by 
psychological tests. We suggest that the abnormalities of behavior and test 
performance may be related atrophic lesions demonstrated by 
pneumoencephalography and computerized axial tomography. We consider several 
explanations to account for the lack of compensation for these cognitive 
defects."
7228031,"For three patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome the existence of normal amounts 
of catalytically inactive hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) 
protein was demonstrated by using antibodies against the normal enzyme subunits. 
The lack of enzyme activity is reverted in virus transformed cells. Individual 
revertant cell clones contain different HGPRT enzymes as demonstrated here by 
isoelectric focusing. The data strongly support the idea of a structural gene 
mutation as the cause of enzyme deficiency in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."
7231549,"DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II purified from healthy plant tissue is capable of 
synthesizing linear (-)-viroid RNA copies of full length from (+)-viroid RNA 
templates in vitro. Together with the specific alpha-amanitin sensitivity of 
viroid replication observed in vivo, these findings suggest that viroids 
replicate by an entirely novel mechanism in which infecting viroid RNA molecules 
are copied by the host enzyme which is normally responsible for the synthesis of 
nuclear precursors to messenger RNA."
7236050,"An observation of carcinoid syndrome in a woman of 47 suffering from malignant 
carcinoid of the ileum with metastases into the liver and right ovary is 
described. The clinical picture included diarrhea, heat waves, bronchospasms, 
hypertension, hyperserotoninemia, affection of the mitral valve and left atrium. 
""Carcinoid plaques"" in the endocardium formed due to excessive proliferation 
under the influence of serotonin and kinins of polypotent subendothelial cells 
followed by their differentiation into fibroblast-like and smooth-muscle 
elements and production of basophilic interstitial substance. The receding 
rheumatic affection of the mitral valve may be the cause of the predominant 
involvement of the left part of the heart."
7240694,"Fanconi's anemia, an inherited disorder characterized by bone marrow aplasia, 
peripheral pancytopenia, and multiple congenital defects, has a association with 
certain types of malignancies. These include acute myelomonocytic leukemia, 
benign and malignant liver tumors, and squamous carcinomas of various organs. We 
report a patient with esophageal carcinoma complicating Fanconi's anemia, 
summarize the various tumors associated to date with the syndrome, and discuss 
possible mechanisms of malignant transformation. This high incidence of 
malignancy must be appreciated for early diagnosis and appropriate therapy."
7243138,"Mondor disease, or superficial thrombophlebitis of the breast, is an uncommon 
disorder that occurs only rarely in pregnant women. One such case is presented 
here followed by a review of the clinicopathologic features of the disease. 
Accurate diagnosis of Mondor disease is based almost entirely on careful 
physical examination of the breast, and no specific treatment is required. Its 
major clinical significance lies in the need to distinguish it from malignancy 
of the breast."
7270517,"To investigate the etiology of spastic diplegia (SD) of prematurity, we compared 
the prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal course of 18 preterm infants with SD to 
that of a control group of preterm infants without SD. No significant 
differences between the group with SD and the control group were found in most 
of the perinatal and neonatal factors analyzed. Significant differences were 
found in birth weight, birth head circumference, and the one-minute Apgar score. 
Controlling for gestational age, infants with SD weighed less at birth, had 
smaller heads, and were more often briefly neurologically depressed. 
Intracranial hemorrhage and neonatal seizures occurred significantly more often 
in infants with SD. Fifteen infants with SD were believed to be neurologically 
normal at the time of nursery discharge. These findings suggest the importance 
of prenatal factors in optimally treated preterm infants in whom SD develops."
7282320,"Trauma, which accounts for a substantial part of the morbidity and mortality in 
industrial nations, is a natural area of interest for orthopaedic surgeons. 
Trauma, and trauma prevention, can be conveniently studied in emergency rooms 
and casualty units which are often run by hospital orthopaedic departments. In 
order to identify the most serious types of accidents and assign priorities as 
regards preventive measures it is necessary to be able to determine in an 
objective way the severity of different types of trauma. The Abbreviated Injury 
Scale is a system developed in the United States for ranking the severity of 
specific trauma lesions. This paper discusses general issues relating to injury 
scaling and accident epidemiology research."
7286205,"It has been shown in experiments on mice that sodium diclofenac and indomethacin 
inhibited antibody titers and the number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) in mice 
immunized with sheep red blood cells. Sodium salicylate in all test doses did 
not produce any shifts in rosette-formation but lowered the number of RFC. As 
regards the immunodepressant activity, sodium diclofenac compares very 
favourably with indomethacin and sodium salicylate. Enhancement of the 
immunoreactivity inhibition caused by the drugs was not proportional to the 
increase in their antiphlogistic effects determined by the Selye model of 
inflammation."
7296908,"Serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured before and during 6 months 
treatment with propranolol (160 mg/day) in eight patients with T3 
(triiodothyronine) toxicosis. Serum total T3 concentrations showed a significant 
(p less than 0.01) and sustained fall to approximately 80% of pre-treatment 
values. Six of the patients, however, remained clinically and biochemically 
hyperthyroid and our data do not support the use of propranolol as sole therapy 
in T3 toxicosis."
7360458,"A 23-year-old black woman was admitted to the hospital in premature labor with 
intact amniotic membranes. The patient was afebrile and did not have any obvious 
signs of infection. Gram stain of the amniotic fluid, obtained via 
transabdominal amniocentesis, revealed the presence of gram-negative rods. The 
bacterium was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the agent of rat-bite 
fever."
7366585,"Cartilage-Hair-Hypoplasia is a rare form of metaphyseal chondrodystrophia. Its 
clinical picture is characterized by dysproportionate deficient growth shift to 
length of upper part of the body. The hair diameter is reduced, and the eyebrows 
are defectly marked. After stimulation by insulin, the levels of somatotropic 
hormone are found in the acromegalic range. The bone structure is rarefied at 
the distal metaphyses of the metacarpals and the proximal metaphyses of the 
finger basal phalanges. The most important roentgenologic symptoms to be found 
are clowdy, cystic rarefactions at the distal femoral metaphyses. As to the 
pathophysiology, deficient proliferation of cartilaginous cells is mentioned in 
literature."
7375968,"Acute febrile juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) of adult onset is often 
diagnosed by ruling out other problems. The classification of JRA is primarily 
based on the distinct type of onset, of which there are usually three: (1) acute 
febrile or Still's type, (2) polyarticular, and (3) monoarticular pauciarticular 
arthritis. Fever of unknown cause is frequently the initial symptom. This type 
of arthritis may be characterized by any or all of the following: unexplained 
high fever, rash, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, pericarditis, 
pleurisy, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias, arthritis, sore 
throat, leukocytosis, anemia, circulating immune complexes, liver test 
abnormalities, and carpal-metacarpal and tarsal-metatarsal fusion. Patients 
often respond dramatically to anti-inflammatory agents. Corticosteroids, gold 
salts, penicillamine, and cytotoxic drugs have been effective for certain 
patients. The prognosis of the disease has been generally favorable. Although 
symptoms may recur, remission can be prolonged."
7378435,"Lipid changes in mitochondria isolated from rat kidney after various periods of 
ischemia were analysed by thin-layer chromatography and gas-liquid 
chromatography. Free fatty acids were increased at 30 min and more so 
thereafter. Total phospholipid fatty acids decreased steadily. The proportion of 
diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the total phospholipid fraction 
decreased at 30 min, but the proportion of phosphatidylcholine and 
phosphatidylethanolamine in the total phospholipid fraction did not change until 
the irreversible phase of ischemic injury. We have shown that decrease of 
cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only 
during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and 
phosphatidylcholine broken down. It is postulated that these phenomena are due 
to activation of phospholipase in the mitochondrial membrane."
7385804,"The authors studied the serum level of T3, T4 and TTH in 30 euthyroid patients 
with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), distributed in three groups of 10 
patients. I group includes patients with CRI II and III stage without dialysis 
treatment, patients with CRI are included in the II group, being under 
hemodialysis treatment from 5 to 12 months, and in III group--patients dialized 
three and more years. Low average values of T3--0.65 mg/ml were established only 
in the first group; in 8 patients, out of 10 examined, the values were under the 
lower limit of the norm. Though the T4 values in the first group were within the 
limits of the norm (5.87 mkg/100 ml), they were under the average normal values 
(8.5 mkg/100 ml) and lower, with a statistical significance (pt less than 0.025) 
as compared with those of the other two groups. The values of T3 and T4 in both 
groups dialyzed patients were within the limits of the norm regardless of the 
duration of dialysis. In none of the patients from the three groups examined, 
deviations in TTH level were found. The authors drew the conclusion that 
biochemical hypothyroidism, manifested with low T3 values, normal TTH level and 
a tendency of T4 decrease was observed in nondialyzed patients even with CRI II 
stage (creatine 6.8 mg%). Biochemical hypothyroidism abates with the adequate 
and effective hemodialysis treatment, suggesting that uremic toxins play and 
essential role in its development. It was stressed that abatement could be used 
as a criterion of adequate and effective dialysis programme and a reliable 
rehabilitation of the patients, under chronodialysis treatment."

fissues, malformed ears, cerebral, cardiac and intestinal malformation, and 
partial 6q25 leads to 6qter trisomy is presented. The baby is the second child 
of a mother with balanced translocation : 46,XX,t(2;6)(q37,q25). The first child

7407041,"The fluorescence increase on the deuterium oxide addition to the solvent medium 
was studied in various tryptophan- (or indole-) and/or tyrosine-containing model 
compounds. It was shown how the rates of the deuteration at the indole NH group 
of tryptophan and at the OH group of tyrosine could be followed independently of 
each other. The method was applied to a study of erabutoxin b molecule, a 
neurotoxic protein from a sea snake, to analyze the microenvironments of its 
single tryptophan and tyrosine residues. It was shown that the ""functionally 
invariant"" single tryptophan residue was exposed to the solvent in the surface 
of the molecule and that the ""structurally conserved"" single tyrosine residue 
was buried in the molecule. The rate of deuteration of the tyrosine residue (80 
s(-1) at pH 6.3 and 33 degrees C) was 1/20 of that of an exposed tyrosine. It 
was also found that the amino group of Lys-27 quenched the fluorescence of 
Trp-29 but its deuteration had no effect on the fluorescence."
7407830,"Caveolae or membrane vesicles are commonly observed in smooth and skeletal 
muscle as well as in working heart muscle. Using sections of fixed tissue and 
replicas of freeze-cleaved material, we show in this study that caveolae are 
also very numerous in sinus node cells of the rabbit, and to a lesser degree, in 
the atrial cells. Caveolae increase the plasma membrane surface area by 115% in 
the leading sinus node, and by 56% in the atrial cells. In these two cell types, 
the membrane of the caveolae contains four times fewer intramembranous particles 
than the rest of the plasma membrane, and this difference applies to both PF and 
EF faces. The role of the caveolae is still unclear, but it does not seem that 
they have a pinocytotic function."
7416166,"An individual with normal male habitus, body proportions, and secondary sexual 
characteristics was admitted to the hospital with head trauma. A routine blood 
smear demonstrated that 36% of the granulocytes had ""drumsticks"". Chromosomal 
analysis revealed a 46,XYqh+ karyotype. the extremely large Y chromosome was 
located by quinacrine fluorescence in the ""drumstick"" of the polymorphonuclear 
granulocytes. The presence of a large Y chromosome may thus produce 
pseudo-drumsticks. Fluorescent staining can distinguish between true drumsticks 
bearing the inactive X of normal females and the pseudo-drumsticks in a normal 
male produced by a large Y chromosome."
7424767,"Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis represent a continuum of the 
same pathologic process. The etiology is an absolute deficiency of thiamine 
rather than a direct toxic effect of alcohol. The triad of Wernicke's 
encephalopathy--global confusional state, ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus, and 
ataxia--is occasionally seen in chronic alcoholics and is often attenuated by 
immediate thiamine treatment. The triad of Korsakoff's psychosis--memory loss, 
learning deficits and confabulation--may be seen in either the acute or the 
long-term care setting."
7431445,"Seventy consecutive surviving patients with pelvic fractures were reviewed to 
define those at high risk for intra-abdominal injury. Eleven (16%) had serious 
associated visceral injuries. Initial hypotension, Malgaigne and bilateral pubic 
rami fractures, and blood requirements exceeding 2,000 cc were suggestive of 
abdominal trauma. These high-risk patients should undergo peritoneal lavage as 
an integral part of their initial management. If the lavage is negative, 
continued hemorrhage should be evaluated with angiography and nonoperative means 
of vascular control attempted before resorting to laparotomy."
7472327,"1. The synaptic activation by mossy fibers (MFs) of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) 
in the vestibular cerebellum (nodulus and uvula) was examined using patch-clamp 
recording methods in thin, rat cerebellar slices with Lucifer yellow-filled 
pipettes for subsequent fluorescence microscopic verification of the cell 
morphology. 2. UBCs were distinguished from adjacent granule cells in thin 
cerebellar slices in the uvula and nodulus regions by their larger soma 
diameters and short dendritic brush, greater whole-cell capacitance, and a 
prolonged, biphasic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) to stimulation of 
MFs. 3. Thin-section transmission electron micrographs of the MF-UBC synapse 
displayed an unusually extensive area of synaptic apposition estimated to 
measure 12-40 microns2. The majority of UBCs was innervated by a single MF. At 
high magnification, individual clusters of presynaptic vesicles could be 
discerned, separated by regions of presynaptic membrane lacking vesicles, but 
apposed to continuous regions of postsynaptic density. Thus, after release, 
transmitter diffusion from the synaptic cleft must traverse considerable 
stretches of postsynaptic membrane before escape into extracellular space. In 
contrast, MF-granule cell synapses in these cerebellar regions resembled 
glutamate synapses in other brain regions in that the total synaptic area 
measured < or = 4 microns2. These synaptic junctions were flanked by short 
stretches of unspecialized plasma membrane, providing a short (0.5 micron) 
diffusional path from the site of neurotransmitter release to a branch point of 
the extracellular space. 4. The MF-evoked EPSC in UBCs was composed of a fast 
(10-90% rise time: 0.70 ms) and slow (10-90% rise time: 395 ms; 10-90% decay 
time: 3.1 s) component. The fast component was blocked by the 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) 
antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 microM) and displayed linear 
current-voltage (I-V) relations in the presence or absence of external 
magnesium. 5. The slow EPSC was also mediated by glutamate receptors, but in 
most neurons both AMPA/KA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contributed 
to the slow EPSC, with the contribution of NMDA receptors predominating in the 
majority of cells. Consequently, although all cells displayed linear I-V 
relations in Mg(2+)-free saline, cells in which the slow EPSC was predominently 
mediated by NMDA receptors exhibited voltage-dependent rectification in the 
presence of external Mg2+ (1 mM). 6. With increasing postnatal age (10-30 d), 
the contribution made to the slow EPSC by NMDA receptors declined, with a 
reciprocal increase in the contribution being made by AMPA/KA 
receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
7473738,"Previous X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the catalytic domain 
of a DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) generating C5-methylcytosine bears a striking 
structural similarity to that of a Mtase generating N6-methyladenine. Guided by 
this common structure, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of 42 
amino-Mtases (N6-adenine and N4-cytosine). This comparison revealed nine 
conserved motifs, corresponding to the motifs I to VIII and X previously defined 
in C5-cytosine Mtases. The amino and C5-cytosine Mtases thus appear to be more 
closely related than has been appreciated. The amino Mtases could be divided 
into three groups, based on the sequential order of motifs, and this variation 
in order may explain why only two motifs were previously recognized in the amino 
Mtases. The Mtases grouped in this way show several other group-specific 
properties, including differences in amino acid sequence, molecular mass and DNA 
sequence specificity. Surprisingly, the N4-cytosine and N6-adenine Mtases do not 
form separate groups. These results have implications for the catalytic 
mechanisms, evolution and diversification of this family of enzymes. 
Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 
adenine/cytosine binding pockets suggests that, structurally and functionally, 
they are remarkably similar to one another."

7477166,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone has many effects on the cardiovascular system. 
During and after cardiopulmonary bypass, serum triiodothyronine concentrations 
decline transiently, which may contribute to postoperative hemodynamic 
dysfunction. We investigated whether the perioperative administration of 
triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) enhances cardiovascular performance in 
high-risk patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery.
METHODS: We administered triiodothyronine or placebo to 142 patients with 
coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular function. The hormone was 
administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.8 microgram per kilogram of body 
weight when the aortic cross-clamp was removed after the completion of bypass 
surgery and then as an infusion of 0.113 microgram per kilogram per hour for six 
hours. Clinical and hemodynamic responses were serially recorded, as was any 
need for inotropic or vasodilator drugs.
RESULTS: The patients' preoperative serum triiodothyronine concentrations were 
normal (mean [+/- SD] value, 81 +/- 22 ng per deciliter [1.2 +/- 0.3 nmol per 
liter]), and they decreased by 40 percent (P < 0.001) 30 minutes after the onset 
of cardiopulmonary bypass. The concentrations in patients given intravenous 
triiodothyronine became supranormal and were significantly higher than those in 
patients given placebo (P < 0.001). However, the concentrations were once again 
similar in the two groups 24 hours after surgery. The mean postoperative cardiac 
index was higher in the triiodothyronine group (2.97 +/- 0.72 vs. 2.67 +/- 0.61 
liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, P = 0.007), and 
systemic vascular resistance was lower (1073 +/- 314 vs. 1235 +/- 387 
dyn.sec.cm-5, P = 0.003). The two groups did not differ significantly in the 
incidence of arrhythmia or the need for therapy with inotropic and vasodilator 
drugs during the 24 hours after surgery, or in perioperative mortality and 
morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients 
undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers 
systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for 
standard postoperative therapy."
7479046,"Translation of yeast GCN4 mRNA occurs by a reinitiation mechanism that is 
modulated by amino acid levels in the cell. Ribosomes which translate the first 
of four upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the mRNA leader resume scanning 
and can reinitiate downstream. Under non-starvation conditions reinitiation 
occurs at one of the remaining three uORFs and GCN4 is repressed. Under 
starvation conditions, in contrast, ribosomes bypass the uORFs and reinitiate at 
GCN4 instead. The high frequency of reinitiation following uORF1 translation 
depends on an adequate distance to the next start codon and particular sequences 
surrounding the uORF1 stop codon. We present evidence that sequences 5' to uORF1 
also strongly enhance reinitiation. First, reinitiation was severely inhibited 
when uORF1 was transplanted into the position of uORF4, even though the native 
sequence environment of the uORF1 stop codon was maintained, and this effect 
could not be accounted for by the decreased uORF1-GCN4 spacing. Second, 
insertions and deletions in the leader preceding uORF1 greatly reduced 
reinitiation at GCN4. Sequences 5' to uORF1 may influence the probability of 
ribosome release following peptide termination at uORF1. Alternatively, they may 
facilitate rebinding of an initiation factor required for reinitiation prior to 
resumption of the scanning process."
7480642,"Within months of Roentgen's discovery of X rays, severe adverse effects were 
reported, but not well publicized. As a result, over the next two decades, 
fluoroscope operators suffered lethal skin carcinomas. Later, case reports 
appeared concerning leukemia in radiation workers, and infants born with severe 
mental retardation after their mothers had been given pelvic radiotherapy early 
in pregnancy. Fluoroscopy and radiotherapy for benign disorders continued to be 
used with abandon until authoritative reports were published on the adverse 
effects of ionizing radiation by the U.S. NAS-NRC and the UK MRC in 1956. 
Meanwhile, exposure to the atomic bombs in Japan had occurred and epidemics of 
delayed effects began to be recognized among the survivors: cataracts (1949), 
leukemia (1952) and severe mental retardation among newborn infants after 
intrauterine exposure (1952). No statistically significant excess of germ-cell 
genetic effects was detected by six clinical measurements (1956), the F1 
mortality (1981), cytogenetic studies (1987) or biochemical genetic studies 
(1988). Somatic cell effects were revealed by long-lasting chromosomal 
aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes (1968), and somatic cell mutations were 
found at the glycophorin A locus in erythrocytes (1992). Molecular biology is a 
likely focus of new studies based on the function of the gene for ataxia 
telangiectasia (1995), a disorder in which children have severe, even lethal 
acute radiation reactions when given conventional doses of radiotherapy for 
lymphoma, to which they are prone. Also, obligate heterozygote female relatives 
can be studied for increased susceptibility to radiation-induced breast cancer, 
as suggested by clinical studies. The tumor registries in Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
now provide incidence data that show the extent of increases in eight common 
cancers and no increase in eight others (1994). The possibility of very late 
effects of A-bomb exposure is suggested by recent reports of increased 
frequencies of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid cancers and certain causes of 
death other than cancer."
7481576,"In this article we review the empirical literature on weight gain associated 
with neuroleptic drug use. Weight gain, which appears to be associated with an 
increase in appetite, is variable but likely to be larger initially and then 
plateau. Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the 
largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known. 
Amantadine and fenfluramine may reverse weight gain to some degree. Dietary fat 
seems to play an important role in obesity, and research is needed to increase 
the data base and elucidate possible mechanisms. Studies are also needed to 
evaluate preventive strategies and to determine which drugs are least likely to 
produce weight gain as well as which drugs could be added to a neuroleptic 
regimen to control weight."
7482069,"Low dose pulse methotrexate (MTX) has become a widely used therapy for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its good response rate profile. With the 
increased use of MTX, reports of opportunistic infections associated with MTX 
therapy have appeared. Fourteen cases of pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia in 
patients receiving low dose MTX have been previously reported. Yet, no case of 
PC pneumonia associated with low dose MTX has so far been reported in Japan. We 
report the first case in Japan of PC pneumonia occurring in a patient with 
rheumatoid vasculitis who was receiving low dose MTX. A 70-year old woman with 
13 year history of RA presented with 3-day history of rapidly aggravating 
dyspnea, dry cough and fever. She had been receiving MTX 7.5 mg/week for 2.5 
months because of her vasculitis symptoms. She had also been receiving 
prednisolone 7.5 mg/day which had been successfully tapered from an initial dose 
of 15 mg/day. At the time of her presentation with respiratory symptoms, all of 
her vasculitis symptoms had been alleviated. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse 
interstitial shadowing bilaterally and bilateral hilar and right lower lung 
field infiltrates. Her arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxemia (PaO2 27.7 
torr). Polymerase chain reaction assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed 
PC. Although the patient required ventilatory support for 9 days, she was 
successfully treated with trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole and methylprednisolone 
pulse therapy. Eight months later, the patient was well with no evidence of 
vasculitis or respiratory symptoms."
7482637,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke subtypes and prognosis differ among older black 
patients compared with whites; however, few data are available regarding stroke 
among young black patients.
METHODS: To determine the risk factors for stroke, stroke subtype, and prognosis 
among young black patients, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 
all 15- to 44-year-old patients admitted with stroke to a university-affiliated 
public hospital from January 1990 through June 1994.
RESULTS: Of the 248 eligible patients admitted with stroke, 219 were blacks. 
Hypertension was more frequently associated with stroke in young black than in 
non-black patients (55% versus 24%, P = .003). Cocaine abuse was frequent among 
both black and non-black patients (27% versus 38%, P = NS). Hypertensive 
intracerebral hemorrhage (64%) was the most common subtype of intracerebral 
hemorrhage (n = 67), and lacunar infarction (21%) was the most common subtype of 
cerebral infarction (n = 112) in young black patients. Outcome in black patients 
with stroke at discharge was 69% independent, 8% dependent, and 23% dead.
CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of hypertension, hypertensive intracerebral 
hemorrhage, and lacunar infarction among young black patients with stroke 
suggests accelerated hypertensive arteriolar damage, possibly due to poor 
control of hypertension."
7482779,"Early biochemical experiments established that the set of dinucleotide odds 
ratios or 'general design' is a remarkably stable property of the DNA of an 
organism, which is essentially the same in protein-coding DNA, bulk genomic DNA, 
and in different renaturation rate and density gradient fractions of genomic DNA 
in many organisms. Analysis of currently available genomic sequence data has 
extended these earlier results, showing that the general designs of disjoint 
samples of a genome are substantially more similar to each other than to those 
of sequences from other organisms and that closely related organisms have 
similar general designs. From this perspective, the set of dinucleotide odds 
ratio (relative abundance) values constitute a signature of each DNA genome, 
which can discriminate between sequences from different organisms. 
Dinucleotide-odds ratio values appear to reflect not only the chemistry of 
dinucleotide stacking energies and base-step conformational preferences, but 
also the species-specific properties of DNA modification, replication and repair 
mechanisms."
7485153,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by deletions, insertions, 
translocations, and point mutations in the NF1 gene, which spans 350 kb on the 
long arm of human chromosome 17. Although several point mutations have been 
described, large molecular abnormalities have rarely been characterized in 
detail. We describe here the molecular breakpoints of a 12-kb deletion of the 
NF1 gene, which is responsible for the NF1 phenotype in a kindred with two 
children affected because of germline mosaicism in the unaffected father, who 
has the mutation in 10% of his spermatozoa. The mutation spans introns 31-39, 
removing 12,021 nt and inserting 30 bp, of which 19 bp are a direct repetition 
of a sequence located in intron 31, just 4 bp before the 5' breakpoint. The 5' 
and 3' breakpoints contain the sequence TATTTTA, which could be involved in the 
generation of the deletion. The most plausible explanation for the mechanism 
involved in the generation of this 12-kb deletion is homologous/nonhomologous 
recombination. Since sperm of the father does not contain the corresponding 
insertion of the 12-kb deleted sequence, this deletion could have occurred 
within the NF1 chromosome through loop formation. RNA from lymphocytes of one of 
the NF1 patients showed similar levels of the mutated and normal transcripts, 
suggesting that the NF1-mRNA from mutations causing frame shifts of the reading 
frame or stop codons in this gene is not degraded during its processing. The 
mutation was not detected in fresh lymphocytes from the unaffected father by PCR 
analysis, supporting the case for true germ-line mosaicism."
7485343,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare the efficacy of triple-marker screening 
(alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin) with 
alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.
STUDY DESIGN: Free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was concurrently assayed in 
2349 maternal serum samples. Trivariate and bivariate algorithms were used to 
calculate the risk for fetal Down syndrome by the two protocols. Free beta-human 
chorionic gonadotropin from 12 cases of fetal Down syndrome previously screened 
with the triple marker was retrospectively assayed.
RESULTS: Mean maternal age of our study was 29.8 years (range 14 to 51 years). 
The initial screen-positive rate with the triple marker was 8.0% compared with 
12.8% for alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. All 
three cases of fetal Down syndrome ascertained in our prospective study were 
detected by the triple marker; in contrast, one of three was detected by 
alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. By adding 12 
additional cases of fetal Down syndrome, 12 of 15 (80%) were screen positive 
with triple marker and nine of 15 (60%) were screen positive with 
alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.
CONCLUSION: The detection rate of fetal Down syndrome was greater by use of a 
triple marker screen than when using alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human 
chorionic gonadotropin. Our data do not support the claims of other studies that 
suggest that alpha-fetoprotein plus free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is 
superior to triple markers."
7487408,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the etiology of and clinicopathologic findings associated 
with meningioangiomatosis and to evaluate MIB1 immunoreactivity (marker of cell 
proliferation) in this lesion.
DESIGN: Retrospective surgical pathology series of three patients.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center with a high volume of epilepsy surgery.
PATIENTS: Individuals with meningioangiomatosis who underwent surgical resection 
of the lesion.
RESULTS: Three patients aged 11, 14, and 32 years (two females, one male) 
comprise the study. All patients presented with a history of intractable 
seizures (2, 3, and 30 years duration). None of the patients had von 
Recklinghausen's disease. All three patients underwent gross total resection of 
the lesion, and postoperative seizure-free intervals range from 7 to 15 months. 
Histologically, the lesion is characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels 
and meningothelial cells arranged around vessels in the meninges, cortex, and 
underlying white matter. Psammoma body formation or dystrophic mineralization 
and gliosis of the intervening parenchyma was observed in all three cases. 
Bodian stains failed to demonstrate neurofibrillary tangles within intervening 
parenchymal neurons. Focal epithelial membrane antigen positivity was observed 
in two lesions and was absent in one. MIB1 staining was observed in two lesions 
(MIB1 index = 0.8 and 0.6) within the meningothelial cell nuclei and was absent 
in one case.
CONCLUSIONS: Meningioangiomatosis is a rare malformative or hamartomatous lesion 
of the central nervous system characterized by a proliferation of vessels and 
perivascular cuffs of meningothelial cells. Absent MIB1 immunoreactivity or low 
MIB1 indices in the lesion support the clinical impression of a slow-growing 
lesion and further support a malformative or hamartomatous etiology."

7492037,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine practice patterns regarding administration of the 
""GI cocktail"" (a mixture of liquid antacid, viscous lidocaine, and an 
anticholinergic) in the emergency department in a single hospital and the 
responses and final dispositions of patients who received the cocktails.
DESIGN: A retrospective review of ED charts.
SETTING: Urban university hospital ED with an annual census of 50,000 visits.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients who received a GI cocktail in 
the ED.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (50%) received a GI cocktail for a chief complaint 
of abdominal pain and 40 (41%) for a chief complaint of chest pain. The reason 
for administration of a GI cocktail was documented on only one chart. Sixty-six 
patients (68%) received at least one other drug, at a median time of 9 minutes 
before administration of the GI cocktail. The most commonly coadministered drug 
was a narcotic (56 patients), followed by nitroglycerin (22 patients), 
antiemetics (13 patients), H2-blockers (13 patients), and aspirin (10 patients). 
Thirty-three patients (34%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail alone, 35 
(36%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail plus other drugs, 7 (7%) had no 
response to the GI cocktail alone, and 5 (5%) had no response to the cocktail 
with other drugs. In 17 patients (18%) the response was not documented. Chest 
pain patients and abdominal pain patients had a similar frequency of response. 
There was also similarity of response between admitted and discharged patients.
CONCLUSION: Although symptomatic relief after administration of a GI cocktail is 
often noted, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of the cocktail from 
those of other coadministered medications such as morphine or nitroglycerin. We 
urge ED physicians to use the GI cocktail in a rational manner."
7492068,"Four families, 29 members, with Pendred's syndrome were studied to clarify 
hearing loss and hormonal status. The ages ranged from 3 to 50 years. Complete 
Pendred's syndrome was found in 9 patients. They had bilateral profound hearing 
loss with residual hearing at low frequencies. Goiter was diagnosed at the age 
of 1 to 14 years with a positive perchlorate discharge test. Twelve of the 
patients' relatives showed partial Pendred's syndrome. Mild sensorineural 
hearing losses occurred in the low- and medium-range frequencies with normal 
perchlorate discharge test results in 6 cases. The other 6 had a slight drop in 
the perchlorate discharge test results with normal hearing. Five subjects were 
normal and 3 had normal hormonal and normal perchlorate discharge test results, 
but were not tested audiologically. This paper shows that patients with 
Pendred's syndrome may have goiter at birth or develop it between 8 and 14 
years, that their deafness is bilateral and profound, and that their perchlorate 
discharge tests are positive. Relatives of Pendred's syndrome patients showed 
mild low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss without goiter and normal 
perchlorate discharge test results in half the cases, and a slight drop in the 
perchlorate discharge test results with normal hearing and without goiter in the 
other half. A correlation between these findings and genetic studies needs 
further investigation."

7493597,"Using the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI), we evaluated caregivers' 
perceptions of personality prior to symptom onset and current personality in 36 
individuals with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). 
Caregivers also completed the self form of the NEO-PI and an index of objective 
and subjective burden. Personality change in DAT was consistent with previous 
reports of increased neuroticism, decreased extraversion, and decreased 
conscientiousness, with smaller decreases in openness and agreeableness. 
Significant relationships were found among perceived present patient 
personality, caregiver personality, and caregiver burden. Regression analyses 
indicated that present patient conscientiousness and caregiver neuroticism were 
the best predictors of both objective and subjective burden, and these variables 
were found to contribute independently to caregivers' reported level of burden. 
To the extent that caregivers perceive specific behaviors and interferences 
negatively, cognitive and supportive interventions are likely to prove extremely 
beneficial."

7498525,"Results are described from application of a computer program that compares the 
expected and actual incidence of CpG dinucleotides in relation to the codon 
reading frame of genes, assuming a conserved amino acid sequence and normalizing 
for the third-position incidences of C and G in the remainder of the sequence. 
Sequences encoding certain proteins showed a pronounced bias in favour of CpG in 
the (3,1) compared with the (2,3) codon position; whereas sequences encoding 
related proteins expressed to a similar extent or in the same tissue did not. We 
propose that the cases exhibiting this bias reflect a difference between the two 
strands of the DNA duplex in their susceptibility to loss of CpG dinucleotides 
by mutation. Although in vertebrates this loss of CpG dinucleotides from the 
sense strand might reflect strand-asymmetry in deamination of 5-methylcytosine 
residues, the fact that a similar CpG codon bias is found in some invertebrates 
indicates that other factor(s) must also be involved."
7498977,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) plays an important role in central 
cardiovascular regulation through the activation of different neurotransmitter 
systems at distinct extrahypothalamic sites. To study possible alterations in 
the TRH system in the hypertensive state, we measured TRH concentration in 
cerebrospinal fluid and TRH content of the preoptic area in spontaneously 
hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) by radioimmunoassay. In 
addition, we also measured the density of the TRH receptor in this area by a 
rapid filtration technique using [3H]methyl-TRH. We found a significant increase 
in both the TRH content (634 +/- 61 versus 350 +/- 26 pg/mg protein, SHR versus 
WKY; P < .01, n = 5) and density of TRH receptors without changes in affinity 
(Bmax, 5.0 +/- 0.1 versus 3.3 +/- 0.1 fmol/mg protein, P < .01, n = 4). An 
increase in TRH concentration was also found in the cerebrospinal fluid of SHR 
(30 +/- 3 versus 21 +/- 2 pg/mL, P < .01, n = 5), suggesting increased TRH 
release in the central nervous system. Northern blot analysis indicated a 
threefold augmented abundance of TRH precursor mRNA in the preoptic area of SHR. 
A polyclonal antibody raised against TRH injected peripherally or 
intracerebroventricularly lowered arterial blood pressure in SHR but not in WKY. 
In addition, long-term treatment with enalapril (5 mg/kg twice daily), which was 
effective in inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by more 
than 50%, decreased arterial blood pressure and preoptic area TRH content of 
SHR, whereas another vasodilator, diltiazem (10 mg/kg every 8 hours), failed to 
produce a similar change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7501550,"The prevalence of persistent microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and peripheral and 
autonomic neuropathy was assessed in 18 children and adolescents with type 1 
(insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who suffered from necrobiosis 
lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) and in 40 diabetics without NLD, matched for sex, 
age, duration of disease, and metabolic control. The mean +/- SD age of the 
patients was 15.1 +/- 8.6 years (range 7.9-23.9 yrs) and their duration of IDDM 
was 10.9 +/- 8.1 years (range 7.1-21.0 yrs). Their mean glycosylated hemoglobin 
level was 9.9 +/- 5.0% (7.3-16.6%) and their fructosamine level was 274 +/- 180 
mumol/L (199-466 mumol/L). Patients with NLD had a higher frequency of 
persistent microalbuminuria (p < 0.001) and retinopathy (p < 0.001) than those 
without NLD. Our study suggests that children as well as adult diabetics with 
NLD can be at high risk for nephropathy and retinopathy; NLD can be a clue for 
diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy."
7503523,"Reducing reperfusion injury is effective in reducing flap loss after prolonged 
ischemia. Anti-inflammatory therapy reduces reperfusion injury in canine cardiac 
muscle and ex vivo rat cremaster muscle; however, to date, there are no studies 
involving the use of anti-inflammatory agents in ischemic skin flaps. This study 
was designed to assess the effects of dexamethasone and indomethacin on the 
viability of rat island groin flaps subjected to 10 hours of ischemia. The 
ischemic control and the treatment group flaps were subjected to 10 hours of 
ischemia by clamping the inferior epigastric vascular pedicle. The treatment 
groups received either intravenous dexamethasone or intravenous indomethacin 
after the flap vascular pedicles were clamped. Our results showed significant 
improvement (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test) in ischemic flap survival using 
dexamethasone. The specific mode of action of dexamethasone was not 
investigated; however, its anti-inflammatory effects were most likely 
responsible for the improvement of flap survival by suppressing the circulating 
neutrophil and decreasing reperfusion injury. Dexamethasone is easily available 
for clinical use, and its use should be considered in cases of prolonged 
ischemia in skin flaps."
7503982,"Obstacles incurred by RNA polymerase II during primary transcript synthesis have 
been identified in vivo and in vitro. Transcription past these impediments 
requires SII, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein. SII also activates a 
nuclease in arrested elongation complexes and this nascent RNA shortening 
precedes transcriptional readthrough. Here we show that in the presence of SII 
and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation 
but not during SII-independent transcription. Thus, under typical transcription 
conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA 
cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional 
impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. 
By mapping the positions of the 3'-ends of RNAs and the elongation complex on 
DNA, we demonstrate that upstream movement of RNA polymerase II is not required 
for limited RNA shortening (seven to nine nucleotides) and reactivation of an 
arrested complex. Arrested complexes become elongation competent after removal 
of no more than nine nucleotides from the nascent RNA's 3'-end. Further cleavage 
of nascent RNA, however, does result in ""backward"" translocation of the enzyme. 
We also show that one round of RNA cleavage is insufficient for full readthrough 
at an arrest site, consistent with a previously suggested mechanism of SII 
action."
7504063,"Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently have autoantibodies 
against a 210-kD integral glycoprotein of the nuclear envelope pore membrane. 
This protein, termed gp210, has a 1,783-amino acid amino-terminal domain located 
in the perinuclear space, a 20-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 58-amino 
acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail. We now demonstrate that autoantibodies 
from 25 patients with PBC that recognize gp210 react with the cytoplasmic 
carboxy-terminal tail while none react with unmodified linear epitopes in the 
amino-terminal domain. The epitope(s) recognized by autoantibodies from all 25 
patients is contained within a stretch of 15 amino acids. The recognized amino 
acid sequence is homologous to the protein products of the Escherichia coli mutY 
gene and Salmonella typhimurium mutB gene with an exact identity of six 
consecutive amino acids, suggesting that anti-gp210 antibodies may arise by 
molecular mimicry of bacterial antigenic determinants."
7504188,"Despite being generally under-represented in the genome, CpG sequences represent 
a disproportionately high fraction of sites involved in mutational events 
leading to human genetic disease. Cytosine within CpG dinucleotides is often 
modified to 5-methylcytosine. Deamination of 5-methylcytosine in situ yields a 
thymine, which being mispaired with guanine, is potentially mutagenic. Previous 
reports have indicated that most mutations recovered at these sites appear to 
originate on the non-transcribed strand as C-->T transitions. This trend may 
however, reflect the lack of detectable mutant phenotypes resulting from this 
transition at the complementary positions on the transcribed strand. To date, 
there has not been a good model system in which mutations can be recovered on 
both strands at the same CpG site. The human hprt gene has MeCpG sites contained 
within arginine codons for which mutations have been recovered on both strands. 
From an analysis of a database of hprt mutations, a statistically significant 
strand bias is observed in mutations recovered at CpG sites. We describe some 
models for the bias of mutation distribution observed at MeCpG sites in light of 
this and previous work are described."
7509311,"The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Finland, 1:25,000 newborn, is one of 
the lowest in Caucasian populations. The delta F508 mutation accounts for 18/40 
(45%) of CF chromosomes in Finland. Other mutations were therefore sought among 
the remaining 55%. Twelve out of 40 chromosomes (30%) were found to carry 
394delTT, whereas G542X and 3732delA were each detected in one chromosome. Eight 
mutations remained unidentified using a testing panel for 26 mutations. Mutation 
394delTT was associated exclusively with haplotype 23-36-13. Five unknown 
mutations were associated with different haplotypes for microsatellite markers, 
whereas three shared the same haplotype. Most delta F508 mutations and all 
unidentified mutations originated from regions of old and dense settlement in 
the coastal regions, whereas 394delTT was geographically clustered and enriched 
in a rural location, consistent with a local founder effect. The remote location 
of Finland and her population history give a plausible explanation for the 
rarity of CF in Finland."
7510447,"A clinical comparison of tacrine (THA) and placebo was performed in 15 Alzheimer 
patients using a double blind crossover technique over 4 plus 4 weeks with one 
drug-free week in between. Treatment results, as evaluated by clinical rating 
scales and neuropsychological tests, were mostly negative. Side effects were 
few, except for elevation liver enzymes which occurred in one third of the 
patients. CSF levels of the monoamine metabolites HVA and 5-HIAA increased on 
tacrine as evidence for activation of dopamine and serotonin pathways through 
cholinergic receptors. Pharmacokinetic investigations showed that the oral 
bioavailability of tacrine was low and greatly varying between subjects. 
Patients with high bioavailability of the drug tended to improve more, and also 
to have more liver enzyme elevations, than those with low bioavailability. A gel 
preparation for rectal administration was manufactured for comparison of plasma 
levels attained during one week's treatment with levels attained with oral 
capsules. Preliminary results indicate that the dose of tacrine can be reduced 
to 50 per cent when administered rectally, probably as by this route the rapid 
first-pass metabolism of the drug in the liver is diminished. A clinical trial 
of tacrine via the rectal route would be justified as this could decrease the 
number of patients with liver side effects and increase the number of patients 
improving on the treatment."
7511773,"Five murine epitopes were defined and mapped within IgA1 protease produced by 
Neisseria meningitidis. Epitopes 1 and 2 were present in IgA1 protease from all 
strains, and from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Epitopes 3 through to 5 varied between 
subgroups of serogroup A meningococci, but have remained constant over decades 
within the subgroups, except for epitope 4, which changed between 1983 and 1987 
during the spread of subgroup III meningococci from Asia to Africa. Binding of 
monoclonal antibodies to epitopes 1, 4 and 5 neutralized enzymatic function. 
Human sera containing antibodies to IgA1 protease as a result of natural 
infection inhibited binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitope 4 but not to the 
other epitopes."
7513085,"Both from a theoretical perspective and by means of several case examples, the 
article focuses on the issue of overcoming the disturbed pre-verbal 
communication behaviour presented by patients in the early stage following 
severe craniocerebral trauma. In patients with brain lesion, a pre-verbal, 
emotionally-focussed tonal language almost invariably is capable of reaching the 
still healthy sections of the person. Hence, it is possible for music therapy to 
both establish contact with the seemingly non-responsive patient and 
re-stimulate the person's fundamental communication competencies and experience 
at the emotional, social and cognitive levels."
7513257,"In the absence of DNA, purified yeast RNA polymerase II can bind RNA to form a 
binary complex. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions 
previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, 
including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP 
from NTP. Both of these reactions are inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Hence, by 
several criteria the RNA in binary complexes is bound to the polymerase in a 
manner quite similar to that in ternary complexes in which the catalytic site 
for nucleotide addition is positioned at or near the 3'-OH terminus of the RNA. 
These findings are consistent with a model for the RNA polymerase ternary 
complex in which the RNA is bound at the 3' terminus through two protein-binding 
sites located up to 10 nt apart."
7513296,"Cyprus is an island in the eastern Mediterranean basin inhabited by people of 
Caucasian extraction, mostly Greek-Cypriots. The most common inherited disease 
among Caucasians is cystic fibrosis (CF). Although no careful scientific study 
had ever been done the impression was that CF was extremely rare among the 
Greek-Cypriots, with an incidence estimated at around 1:30,000. About 2 years 
ago, we introduced molecular diagnostic methodology in an effort to assist 
clinicians in safer diagnosis of patients presenting with atypical CF 
symptomatology, and also for testing the hypothesis that mutations that cause 
milder phenotypes might be responsible for misdiagnosis or for missing entirely 
some cases of CF. Initial screening for delta F508 revealed that it is indeed 
rare in the general population. Further screening of suspected CF patients 
revealed a novel mutation that converted leucine at position 346 to proline 
(L346P) in two unrelated families. The second CF mutation was delta F508 and 
1677delTA in the two families respectively, both reportedly associated with 
severe phenotypes. Yet our patients did not present with typical CF pictures 
possibly because of the dominant nature of this novel mild mutation in exon 7. 
Symptoms included failure to thrive, chest infections and electrolyte 
disturbances. These findings raise the possibility that Cyprus might have been 
spared very severe CF phenotypes but not cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations."
7513503,"Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related 
tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell 
tumors (SRCTs). The glycoprotein p30/32MIC2 is highly, but not exclusively, 
expressed in both ES and PN. Although the monoclonal antibody (Mab) HBA71, which 
reacts with P30/32MIC2, has been reported to be relatively specific and highly 
sensitive for both neoplasms, it is not readily available. Yet, Mab O13 is 
commercially available, and it purportedly displays the same immunostaining 
characteristics as HBA71. Because O13 has not been studied extensively, we 
immunostained 21 ES/PNs and 147 other tumors or lesions that might show 
SRCT-like features with O13. The results were similar to those reported for 
HBA71. We found O13 to be 100% sensitive for ES/PN; and, no immunostaining was 
noted on the SRCTs often included in the differential diagnosis of ES/PN (i.e., 
conventional neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and non-lymphoblastic lymphomas). 
But, O13 immunoreacted with lymphoblastic lymphomas and some other tumors and 
normal tissues. Nonetheless, this nonspecific reactivity should not cause 
diagnostic problems, if an antibody panel containing anti-desmin and 
anti-leukocyte common antigen is used in conjunction with O13. We conclude that, 
within the proper diagnostic context, strong immunoreactivity of a SRCT tumor 
for O13 should be considered good evidence that the tumor is ES/PN."
7515658,"The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder 
characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central 
nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps. To examine the 
possible involvement of mutations of the APC gene, which is responsible for 
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in Turcot syndrome, we examined DNAs from 
TS patients for alterations in this gene by means of ribonuclease protection 
analysis. Germ-line APC mutations were detected in each of three unrelated cases 
of TS, and additional (somatic) mutations were observed in colonic adenomas that 
had developed in one of these patients. However, no somatic mutations in APC 
were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, 
astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS. 
These results suggest that the APC gene is associated with pathogenesis of one 
feature of TS, but that at least one other gene is responsible for the genesis 
of neuroepithelial tumors in the CNS."
7515725,"Two contrasting substrates, Drosophila laminin and human vitronectin, caused 
determined primary Drosophila embryo cells to follow alternate intermediate 
differentiation steps without affecting the final outcome of differentiation. 
Integrin alpha PS2 beta PS3 was essential for the initial spreading of myocytes 
on vitronectin: focal contacts rich in beta PS3 integrins formed and were 
connected by actin- and myosin-containing stress fibers. While alpha PS2 beta 
PS3 was unnecessary for myotube formation on laminin, it was required for the 
subsequent change to a sarcomeric cytoarchitecture. The differentiating primary 
cultures synthesized integrins and assembled them into detergent-insoluble, 
cytoskeleton-associated complexes. Collagen IV, laminin, glutactin, papilin, and 
other extracellular matrix proteins were made primarily by hemocytes and were 
secreted into the medium. Further differentiation within the cultures was 
influenced by secreted components and by later addition of vitronectin or bovine 
serum. Comparison of the differentiation of various cell types on the two 
substrates showed that vitronectin provided a selective advantage for the 
differentiation of myocytes, with enrichment over epithelia, epidermal cells, 
and neurites."
7517178,"The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes 
(CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune 
surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides 
derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules 
expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now 
numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated 
control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the 
intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of 
tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional 
deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to 
as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma 
(BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have 
restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting 
a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to 
an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene 
transfected BL cells were not only susceptible to lysis by virus-specific CTL 
but were also capable of efficiently activating an antigen-specific CTL 
response. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of these BL cells was not affected 
by the significantly down-regulated expression of adhesion molecules such as 
LFA1 alpha, LFA1 beta and LFA3. These findings suggest that resistance of tumour 
cells to CTL-mediated immune control can be reversed if the relevant peptide 
epitopes are appropriately presented on the cell surface."
7519874,"The neurofibromatosis type I gene encodes a protein, neurofibromin, which may 
function as a tumor suppressor gene product. Recent studies have demonstrated 
loss of neurofibromin in tumors from NF1 and non-NF1 patients, including 
neurofibrosarcomas, neuroblastomas and malignant melanomas. Since neurofibromin 
is expressed in the adrenal gland, six pheochromocytomas and one adrenal 
cortical tumor were examined for neurofibromin expression. In all seven tumors, 
no neurofibromin could be detected. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
analysis demonstrated that in one of the pheochromocytomas, reduction to 
homozygosity was observed for both 17p and 17q markers while the adrenal 
cortical tumor demonstrated LOH for only 17q markers. The frequent LOH 
surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors 
suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal 
gland neoplasms in patients with NF1."
7522195,"Between September 1st 1990 and Juli 31st 1993, 5071 pregnant women were screened 
prospectively by the ""triple-test"", including maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, 
human chorionic gonadotropin and unconjugated oestriol in order to detect 
chromosomal anomalies and open neural tube defects. The serum samples were 
collected in collaboration with the obstetricians of the region of 
West-Mecklenburg and North-West-Brandenburg. Laboratory testing using 
radioimmunoassays was performed between weeks 15 and 20 of gestation, all serum 
specimens being investigated in only one institution. The original 
alpha-software from Wald et al. was the basis for calculating the statistical 
risk for Down's syndrome. Pregnant women with a high risk for Down's syndrome 
(cutoff > or = 1:250) were taken care of in a special outpatient clinic 
including procedures like amniocentesis and fetal blood sampling. Amongst 5071 
pregnant women, 21 fetal anomalies were seen. Five cases of Down's syndrome, 
three of trisomy 18, one trisomy 13, two cases of triploidy and four cases of 
open neural tube defects, one 46 xy/45 x mosaic karyotype and one case of 
gastroschisis could be diagnosed correctly. One case of trisomy 21, one case of 
trisomy 18 and two open neural tube defects showed false negative results. Using 
the cutoff of 1:250 for prenatal detection of Down's syndrome and performing 
ultrasound routinely to determine gestational age, the sensitivity of the 
""triple-test"" was 83.33% having a specificity of 92.68%. The predictive value of 
a positive test for prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome was 1.33%.(ABSTRACT

7522538,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an 
increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. The NFI gene has been 
cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor 
gene. Here we analyzed the role of mutations in TP53 in four malignant NFI 
tumors. Mutations were found in 3 out of 4 tumors. One of these mutations is a 
common missense mutation in codon 278 in one of the previously identified hot 
spots for mutations. The two other are hitherto unreported mutations, including 
a splice mutation of exon 3 and a nonsense mutation in exon 4. In addition, 
these four tumors also showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for markers on 
chromosome 17 in the region of TP53. Malignant NFI tumors are initiated by a 
somatic inactivation of the second NFI allele. Tumor progression, however, 
occurs by accumulation of additional genetic abnormalities, such as homozygous 
inactivation of TP53, as demonstrated in this paper."
7525736,"Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of pigmentation 
characterized by congenital patches of white skin and hair that lack 
melanocytes. Piebaldism results from mutations of the KIT proto-oncogene, which 
encodes the cell-surface receptor transmembrane tyrosine kinase for an embryonic 
growth factor, Steel factor. Several pathologic mutations of the KIT gene have 
now been identified in different patients with piebaldism. Correlation of these 
mutations with the associated piebald phenotypes has led to the recognition of a 
hierarchy of three classes of mutations that result in a graded series of 
piebald phenotypes, and to improved understanding of the mechanisms that 
underlie dominant genetic disorders."
7525959,"Several new pyridoacridine alkaloids, dehydrokuanoniamine B (1), shermilamine C 
(2), and cystodytin J (3), in addition to the known compounds cystodytin A (4), 
kuanoniamine D (5), shermilamine B (6), and eilatin (7), were isolated from a 
Fijian Cystodytes sp. ascidian. Their structures were determined by analyses of 
spectroscopic data. These compounds along with a previously reported 
pyridoacridine, diplamine (8), showed dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation 
in human colon tumor (HCT) cells in vitro. All compounds inhibited the 
topoisomerase (TOPO) II-mediated decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) in a 
dose-dependent manner. The pyridoacridines' ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated 
decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability 
to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of 
the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by 
which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Incorporation 
studies show that pyridoacridines disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis with little 
effect on protein synthesis. It appears that DNA is the primary cellular target 
of the pyridoacridine alkaloids. These results are consistent with those for 
known DNA intercalators."
7526378,"Structural features associated with the ability of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
to discriminate between protein variants are identified and engineered. The 
variants are the curaremimetic toxin alpha from Naja nigricollis and erabutoxin 
a or b from Laticauda semifasciata, which differ from each other by 16 
substitutions and one insertion. The neutralizing mAb M alpha 1 recognizes with 
high affinity a topographical epitope on the surface of toxin alpha, but fails 
to recognize the erabutoxins although they possess most of the residues forming 
the presumed epitope. Examinations of the toxin alpha and erabutoxin 3-D 
structures and molecular dynamics simulations reveal several differences between 
the variants. In particular, the region involving the beta-turn 17-24 is 
organized differently. Analysis of the differences found in this region suggest 
that the insertion (or deletion) at position 18 of the variant amino acid 
sequences is particularly important in determining the differential 
cross-reactivity. To test this proposal, residue 18 was deleted in one 
erabutoxin using site-directed mutagenesis, and the biological properties of the 
resulting mutant were examined. We found that full antigenicity was restored in 
the previously unrecognized variant. The implications of this finding are 
discussed."
7528809,"Primate and rodent genomes are populated with hundreds of thousands copies of 
Alu and B1 elements dispersed by retroposition, i.e., by genomic reintegration 
of their reverse transcribed RNAs. These, as well as primate BC200 and rodent 
4.5S RNAs, are ancestrally related to the terminal portions of 7SL RNA sequence. 
The secondary structure of 7SL RNA (an integral component of the signal 
recognition particle) is conserved from prokaryotes to distant eukaryotic 
species. Yet only in primates and rodents did this molecule give rise to 
retroposing Alu and B1 RNAs and to apparently functional BC200 and 4.5S RNAs. To 
understand this transition and the underlying molecular events, we examined, by 
comparative analysis, the evolution of RNA structure in this family of molecules 
derived from 7SL RNA. RNA sequences of different simian (mostly human) and 
prosimian Alu subfamilies as well as rodent B1 repeats were derived from their 
genomic consensus sequences taken from the literature and our unpublished 
results (prosimian and New World Monkey). RNA secondary structures were 
determined by enzymatic studies (new data on 4.5S RNA are presented) and/or 
energy minimization analyses followed by phylogenetic comparison. Although, with 
the exception of 4.5S RNA, all 7SL-derived RNA species maintain the cruciform 
structure of their progenitor, the details of 7SL RNA folding domains are 
modified to a different extent in various RNA groups. Novel motifs found in 
retropositionally active RNAs are conserved among Alu and B1 subfamilies in 
different genomes. In RNAs that do not proliferate by retroposition these motifs 
are modified further. This indicates structural adaptation of 7SL-like RNA 
molecules to novel functions, presumably mediated by specific interactions with 
proteins; these functions were either useful for the host or served the selfish 
propagation of RNA templates within the host genome."
7529539,"Congenital neutropenias include a heterogenous group of diseases characterized 
by a decrease in circulating neutrophils. In phase I/II/III studies in patients 
with severe congenital and cyclic neutropenia, treatment with recombinant human 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) resulted in a rise in the 
absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and a reduction in infections. We report the 
effects of long-term safety of subcutaneous r-metHuG-CSF administration in 54 
patients (congenital n = 44. cyclic n = 10) treated for 4-6 years. A sustained 
ANC response was seen in 40/44 severe congenital neutropenia patients and 10/10 
cyclic neutropenia patients. Two patients required an increase of > 25% in dose 
to maintain a clinical response; one patient became refractory to therapy. A 
significant decrease in the incidence of severe infections and the need for 
intravenous antibiotics was noted. Significant adverse events noted which may or 
may not be related to therapy included: osteopenia (n = 15), splenomegaly (n = 
12), hypersplenism (n = 1), vasculitis (n = 2), glomerulonephritis (n = 1), BM 
fibrosis (n = 2), MDS/leukaemia (n = 3), and transient inverted chromosome 5q 
with excess blasts (n = 1). R-metHuG-CSF has been well tolerated in the majority 
of patients and resulted in a long-term improvement in their clinical status."
7529964,"Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of pigmentation 
characterized by white patches of skin and hair. Melanocytes are lacking in 
these hypopigmented regions, the result of mutations of the KIT gene, which 
encodes the cell surface receptor for steel factor (SLF). We describe the 
analysis of 26 unrelated patients with piebaldism-like hypopigmentation--17 
typical patients, 5 with atypical clinical features or family histories, and 4 
with other disorders that involve white spotting. We identified novel pathologic 
mutations or deletions of the KIT gene in 10 (59%) of the typical patients, and 
in 2 (40%) of the atypical patients. Overall, we have identified pathologic KIT 
gene mutations in 21 (75%) of 28 unrelated patients with typical piebaldism we 
have studied. Of the patients without apparent KIT mutations, none have apparent 
abnormalities of the gene encoding SLF itself (MGF), and genetic linkage 
analyses in two of these families are suggestive of linkage of the piebald 
phenotype to KIT. Thus, most patients with typical piebaldism appear to have 
abnormalities of the KIT gene."
7532356,"Down syndrome is usually caused by complete trisomy 21. Rarely, it is due to 
partial trisomy of the segment 21q22. We report on a 33-month-old girl with 
tetrasomy 21 pter-->q22.1 resulting from an extra chromosome idic(21)(q22.1). 
She has craniofacial traits typical of Down syndrome, including brachycephaly, 
third fontanel, upward slanting palpebral fissures, round face, and protruding 
tongue. Speech development is quite delayed whereas motor development is only 
mildly retarded. The molecular content of the extra isodicentric chromosome was 
defined by molecular genetic investigations using 13 single copy probes unique 
to chromosome 21, and SOD1 expression studies. The child was found to have 4 
copies of the region defined by D21S16 (21cen) through D21S93 on 21q22.1 and two 
copies of the remaining region defined by SOD1-->D21S55-->D21S123. In view of 
the recent assignment of Down syndrome facial characters to the 21q22 region, 
defined in part by D21S55, it is significant that this child shows a subset of 
Down syndrome facial manifestations, without duplication of this region. These 
results suggest that genes contributing to the facial and some of the hand 
manifestations of Down syndrome also exist in the chromosomal region proximal to 
D21S55 in band 21q22.1."
7533711,"Comparisons of toxicities elicited by nonpolar and polar narcotics, weak acid 
uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, and bioreactive chemicals between the 
eucaryotic systems Pimephales promelas and Tetrahymena pyriformis and the 
procaryotic systems Escherichia coli and Photobacterium phosphoreum were 
performed. Each chemical had been a priori assigned a mechanism/mode of action 
based on the results from previous studies with eucaryotic systems. 
Hydrophobicity-dependent QSARs for nonpolar narcosis for both the E. coli and 
the P. phosphoreum endpoints was developed. However, due to the lack of a 
significant relationship between P. phosphoreum toxicity and log Kow, such a 
QSAR for polar narcosis was developed only for the E. coli endpoint. Except for 
4-nitroaniline (the only chemical in the examined group that required activation 
to become the Michael receptor), all chemicals containing reactive substructures 
revealed excess toxicity over polar narcosis QSAR for E. coli endpoints. 
Moreover, chloroacidic acid and ethyl chloroacetate in this system also appear 
to be bioreactive. The only mechanism that seemed to not exist in the 
procaryotic system was uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Chemicals from 
this group, except 2,4-dinitroaniline, did not exhibit excess toxicity over 
polar narcosis QSAR. This was thought to be explained by the lack of 
mitochondria in procaryotes, the target site of uncoupling agents in eucaryotes. 
In addition, evaluation of toxicities of halogen-substituted short-chain 
carboxylic alcohols indicated that their mechanisms vary, depending upon the 
type of substitution and the system."
7534789,"We have previously reported the identification, using human immune sera, of 
mimotopes of human hepatitis B virus surface Ag (HBsAg) displayed on filamentous 
phage. To test if these mimotopes could be useful in developing a vaccine 
against the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), we have compared the humoral immune 
response of animals immunized either with a recombinant HBsAg vaccine, or with 
mimotopes. Immunogens were prepared by fusing the mimotopes on different carrier 
molecules (phage coat protein pIII and pVIII, recombinant human H ferritin, HBV 
core peptide) and by synthesizing multiple antigenic peptides carrying the 
mimotopes' amino acid sequences. These immunogens were injected into mice and 
rabbits and sera were collected and tested for the presence of HBsAg-specific 
Abs. Our data confirm that mimotopes can induce a humoral immune response 
resembling that induced by the original Ag, and HBsAg mimotopes displayed on 
phage prove to be the best immunogens, inducing the most reproducible and potent 
immunization. Mimotopes that react as HBV subtype-specific Ags do not show this 
specificity as immunogen and induce a nonsubtype-restricted response. 
Furthermore, mimotopes displayed on phage elicit a strong response to HBsAg in a 
strain of mouse reported to show a low response to it. These results indicate 
that mimotopes identified from random peptide libraries through utilizing human 
immune sera could be important leads for the derivation of new vaccines."
7536414,"The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the 
mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of 
the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal 
cytosine, is present at the target site. We synthesized an oligonucleotide 
duplex containing a single target site for the EcoRII methyltransferase, in 
which the target base is 5-azacytosine. This substrate formed a stable covalent 
complex with EcoRII methyltransferase in the absence and in the presence of the 
cofactor S-adenosylmethionine. The complex formed in the presence of the 
cofactor was resistant to SDS and moderate heat treatment, and a methyl group 
was incorporated into the complex. Enzyme titration and kinetic studies of 
inhibition suggest that methyl transfer to the complex occurred only during the 
first turnover of the reaction. These results suggest that, when the enzyme 
binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is 
transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of 
the enzyme."
7536936,"During early mammalian embryogenesis, one of the two X chromosomes in somatic 
cells of the female becomes inactivated through a process that is thought to 
depend on a unique initiator region, the X-chromosome inactivation center (Xic). 
The recently characterized Xist sequence (X-inactive-specific transcript) is 
thought to be a possible candidate for Xic. In mice a further genetic element, 
the X chromosome-controlling element (Xce), is also known to influence the 
choice of which of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. We report that a region 
of the mouse X chromosome lying 15 kb distal to Xist contains several sites that 
show hypermethylation specifically associated with the active X chromosome. 
Analysis of this region in various Xce strains has revealed a correlation 
between the strength of the Xce allele carried and the methylation status of 
this region. We propose that such a region could be involved in the initial 
stages of the inactivation process and in particular in the choice of which of 
the two X chromosomes present in a female cell will be inactivated."
7539246,"Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled the association of 
epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) with point mutations of keratin 14 and/or 
keratin 5 genes to be established. We describe here the detection of point 
mutations in genomic DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections from 
five cases of epidermolysis bullosa using the PCR amplification of specific 
alleles (PASA) method. In two of four cases of Köbner-type EBS a point mutation 
of helix 2b (384 Leu-Pro) was detected and in one case of Dowling-Meara-type EBS 
a mutation in helix 1a (125 Arg-Cys) was detected. The results of this study are 
consistent with previous reports and they demonstrate that the PASA method is a 
rapid and reproducible method for the detection of single-base changes and small 
deletions."
7541126,"Patients who achieved bone marrow engraftment of cord blood-derived progenitor 
cells provided an opportunity to examine the expression of fetal Hb by neonatal 
hematopoietic progenitors in a postneonatal host. Cord blood cells from 
histocompatible siblings were successfully transplanted in two children with the 
Fanconi anemia syndrome. One of the transplant donors had heterocellular 
hereditary persistence of fetal Hb, apparently due to gamma-globin gene 
triplication; the other donor was hematologically normal. The G gamma/A gamma 
ratio of the patient who received his transplant from the donor with hereditary 
persistence of fetal Hb was markedly elevated, similar to that of the transplant 
donor's cord blood, and this ratio remained elevated in subsequent months. In 
the other child, the G gamma/A gamma ratio immediately after her transplant was 
typical of the normal newborn, and over the next several months it reverted to 
the adult pattern. Globin synthesis studies performed shortly after engraftment 
demonstrated ratios of fetal Hb/adult Hb synthesis in both patients that were 
typical of those of normal newborns. Over the next several months, both patients 
converted to the adult pattern. Fetal Hb to adult Hb switching in these patients 
seemed to follow a temporal sequence intrinsic to the transplanted neonatal 
progenitor cells, without discernible influence of postneonatal environmental 
factors. The program for Hb switching seems to be an inherent feature of 
neonatal hematopoietic progenitor cells."
7544735,"The aim of the present investigation was the evaluation of cost-effectiveness of 
variables used in monitoring patients with inoperable prostate cancer. 
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and 
radionuclide bone scan were considered. The tumor marker positivity was assessed 
according to dynamic criteria (> 50% increase between consecutive samples). 108 
patients entered the study; 72 patients treated with a luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone analogue were followed up for periods ranging from 12 
to 64 months. PSA and PAP levels were measured using immunometric assays. Both 
cutoff-based and dynamic, serial sample-based decision criteria were employed. 
With respect to a positive bone scan, PSA showed negative predictive values of 
82 and 77%, respectively, using 4 and 10 ng/ml as cutoff points. Progression of 
the disease to the bone occurred in 20 patients: in 17 PSA was the first 
indicator of progression, in the other 3 PAP anticipated PSA for a very short 
time (3-4 months), which was not of relevance to clinical decisions. PAP is less 
specific and sensitive than PSA; PAP may eventually provide information on 
disease status in a limited percentage of patients with advanced prostate cancer 
treated with androgen ablation, being differently regulated with respect to PSA. 
No increasing PSA profile was detected in patients who responded to the therapy. 
From the results of the present investigation, we draw the following 
conclusions: (1) PSA can be used reliably as a unique tool in the follow-up of 
patients for the early detection of progressive disease, and (2) dynamic 
criteria of evaluation of serial PSA determinations probably provide more 
effective and earlier clinical information."
7544745,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an artificial intelligent diagnostic system with neural 
networks to determine genetical disorders and fetal health problems by using 
maternal serum markers ('Triple Test') and maternal age.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 112 pregnant women were referred to Fetal Medicine Unit 
of Hacettepe University Hospital for fetal ultrasonography and chromosome 
analysis with different indications. All patients underwent genetic 
amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling under ultrasound guidance. Gross 
malformations and hydrops fetalis were detected in 15 and 5 fetuses, 
respectively. We have found chromosomal abnormality in 7 cases. 'Triple Test' is 
offered to all patients and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic 
gonadotropin and unconjugated estriol were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In this 
study, we have used supervised artificial neural network structure to develop a 
diagnostic system. Our system's input parameters are maternal age, gestational 
age and 'Triple Test' results. Our system consists of two different artificial 
neural network modules whose decision-making logics are different. One of them 
is designed to search genetical disorders while the other one is for the 
assessment of fetal well-being. Confusion matrix is used for statistical 
evaluation.
RESULTS: The discriminatory power of the artificial neural network to search 
genetical disorders and fetal well-being is found to be highly significant (z = 
10.583 and z = 10.424, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This system brings objectively to the evaluation of 'Triple Test' 
results and can be used both for the detection of genetical disorders and fetal 
well-being. Nevertheless, the analysis program's performance is limited to input 
information and knowledge and medical expert expert can not get more than he or 
she has donated the system."
7544777,"CD44 designates a large family of proteins generated from one gene by 
alternative splicing. Variants of CD44 (CD44v) differ from the standard form 
(CD44s) by usage of ten variant exons in various combinations. Some variants 
have been causally related to the metastatic spread of rat tumor cells. In human 
mammary carcinomas and colorectal carcinomas, the expression of CD44v has also 
been correlated with more progressed tumor stages. Moreover, the expression of 
CD44v on mammary and colorectal carcinomas correlates with a bad prognosis for 
patient survival. The biochemical features of these CD44 isoforms that may 
account for both their normal functions and their roles in tumor progression are 
discussed."
7544864,"Comparisons of pol gene nucleotide and reverse transcriptase (RT) amino acid 
sequences of 47 retroviruses, 3 caulimoviruses, and 5 hepadnaviruses showed that 
approximately one-third of the gene at the 5' end is much more conserved than 
other pol regions. The most conserved regions on both the nucleotide and amino 
acid sequences were chosen for construction of phylogenetic trees. The 
maximum-parsimony and distance-matrix methods were used for analyses of aligned 
amino acid sequences; these two methods, and the compatibility method, were used 
to analyze the aligned nucleotide sequences. Essentially identical majority-rule 
consensus trees were produced by these different methods from both the pol gene 
nucleotide and RT amino acid sequences, which divided the 55 retroelements into 
six major groups. The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was probed with the 
bootstrapping of 100 replicates of the original sequence alignments. The 
grouping results were shown to be statistically significant by multiple 
comparisons with the least-significant-difference procedure."
7544967,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic 
acid) in treating photoaging is well established. Questions that remain are (1) 
whether irritation causes all or part of the improvement; (2) the concentration 
of tretinoin that maximizes clinical response with minimal side effects; and (3) 
the effects of long-term treatment on components of the cutaneous immune system. 
To address these issues, 99 photoaged patients completed a 48-week study using 
0.1% tretinoin cream (n = 32), 0.025% tretinoin (n = 35), or vehicle (n = 32) 
once daily in a double-blind manner. Before and after treatment, we assessed 
histologic features, keratinocyte expression of HLA-DR and intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1, numbers of epidermal Langerhans' cells and epidermal and 
dermal T lymphocytes, and vascularity as measured by dermal endothelial cell 
area.
RESULTS: Both 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced statistically significant 
overall improvement in photoaging of the face compared with vehicle; there were 
no clinically or statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 
two concentrations of tretinoin. After 48 weeks, 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin 
produced similar statistically significant epidermal thickening (by 30% and 28%, 
respectively) compared with vehicle (11% decrease) and increased vascularity (by 
100% and 89%, respectively) compared with vehicle (9% decrease). By various 
analyses, irritant side effects (erythema and scaling) were statistically 
significantly greater with 0.1% tretinoin than with 0.025% tretinoin. No 
significant changes occurred in any immunologic markers when tretinoin and 
vehicle treatments were compared.
CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.1% and 0.025% produce similar clinical and histologic 
changes in patients with photoaging, despite significantly greater incidence of 
irritation with the higher concentration. The separation between clinical 
improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation 
dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans."
7546221,"We have recently identified on rat chromosome 10q a germline mutation in the 
tuberous sclerosis gene (Tsc2), the gene predisposing to renal carcinoma (RC) in 
the Eker rat. The homozygous mutant condition is lethal at around the 13th day 
of fetal life. In heterozygotes, RCs invariably develop in the first year of 
life. Histologically, RCs develop through multiple stages from early 
preneoplastic lesions (i.e., phenotypically altered tubules) to adenomas. The 
wild-type allele mutation has been found even in the earliest preneoplastic 
lesions, fitting Knudson's two-hit hypothesis and supporting the hypothesis that 
Tsc2 is a tumor suppressor gene. In this study, homozygous deletion of the Ink4 
homologue on rat chromosome 5q was observed in 14 of 24 (58%) RC-derived cell 
lines. This may represent involvement of a second tumor suppressor gene, 
contributing to tumor progression. Considering previous results of studies of 
homozygous deletion of the Ifn alpha gene in five of 24 cases (21%) and the Ifn 
beta gene in one of 24 cases (4%), the order of the genes may be Ink4-Ifn 
alpha-Ifn beta. Microsatellite instability was not observed in 26 Eker rat 
tumors."
7549032,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a relatively rare skin disorder with an 
estimated incidence of 1:10,000 in the UK. It is characterized by urticarial 
plaques and blisters on the elbows, buttocks, and knees, although other sites 
may also be involved. The eruption tends to be persistent: only 10-15% of 
patients have spontaneous remission over a 25-year study period. The disease is 
characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in the upper dermis of uninvolved 
skin and the diagnosis should not be made in the absence of these deposits. 
Two-thirds of patients have a small intestinal enteropathy with villous atrophy 
as seen in coeliac disease (CD). However, the remaining third also show evidence 
of a gluten sensitivity in the intestine, as judged by increased lymphocytic 
infiltration of the epithelium. Villous atrophy also ensues after gluten 
challenge in those patients with previous normal villous architecture. The 
initial treatment of the rash is with one of the following three drugs, dapsone, 
sulphapyridine or sulphamethoxypyridazine. However, the rash also clears with 
gluten withdrawal. It must be stressed, however, that the average time to 
achieve significant reduction in drug requirements is 6 months and it can be 
over 2 years before drugs are no longer required. On re-introduction of gluten 
the eruption recurs. Patients with DH have a high incidence of auto-immune 
disorders, thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes, 
and should be screened for those diseases on a yearly basis. As with coeliac 
disease there is also an increased incidence of lymphoma and a gluten-free diet 
appears to protect patients from this complication. The mechanism by which 
gluten causes the skin lesions has still to be elucidated, but current 
investigations implicate lymphocytes and cytokines in the pathogenesis. The 
original hypothesis of an antigen-antibody reaction in the skin with complement 
activation causing the skin lesions, may not be correct."
7549047,"It has been reported that interdigestive motor activities occur in the 
gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi as well as in the gastroduodenal tract and 
truncal vagus nerves modulate the gastroduodenal motility pattern. In the 
present study, the vagal branches which influence on the interdigestive motor 
activity of these organs were determined in conscious dogs. In the normal dog, 
interdigestive motor activities closely related to interdigestive migrating 
motor complex (IMC) in the gastric antrum and descending duodenum were recorded 
in the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi. In dogs whose celiac branches of the 
vagus nerve were chronically resected, cycle periods of interdigestive motor 
activity in the stomach, duodenum, gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi 
significantly prolonged as compared with those in the normal dog but the 
interrelation of them persisted. Quiescent period in motility prolonged and the 
active period shortened. Resection of the pyloric branches had no influence on 
the interdigestive motor activities in all organs. The results imply that celiac 
branches of the vagus nerve modulate the interdigestive motor activity in the 
stomach, descending duodenum, gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi."
7549071,"Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the 
leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin 
seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not 
proven in a satisfactory manner. Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more 
readily than occlusive thrombi. For this indication the optimal dose regimens 
for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not 
established. Acute massive pulmonary embolism with hypotension or shock should 
be treated with thrombolytic drugs and, pending the outcome in the first hour, 
be considered for pulmonary embolectomy. Major acute pulmonary embolism with 
haemodynamic instability responds well to thrombolysis. Whether thrombolysis is 
superior to heparin in subacute intermediate pulmonary embolism has not been 
proven unequivocally in terms of mortality or clinically important endpoints. 
Systemic administration of thrombolytic drugs for peripheral arterial occlusion 
has been abandoned for catheter-directed and intraoperative intra-arterial 
repeated bolus or short-term infusions. The efficacy and safety of intravenous 
thrombolytic treatment following a major ischaemic stroke is presently being 
tested in large scale trials; its use must be restricted to experimental 
protocols."
7551976,"The intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells into antilymphocyte serum 
(ALS)-treated mice induces significant prolongation of donor skin grafts. The 
intrathymic route of antigen presentation in this model is superior to the 
intravenous route in achieving unresponsiveness. To elucidate possible 
mechanisms involved in the induction of unresponsiveness in ALS-treated mice 
after intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells, we have analysed the 
reactivity of lymphoid cells from unresponsive mice in various ways. Deletion of 
donor reactive cells has been studied using the Mls antigen system. Functional 
inactivation was analysed by a sequential study of the frequency of donor 
reactive cells. Suppressor cell activity was studied using an adoptive transfer 
assay. Deletion of donor reactive cells was partial and occurred largely in the 
spleen in both early and late stages of unresponsiveness. The frequency of donor 
reactive cytotoxic cells was suppressed in both spleen and lymph nodes from day 
+/- 13 until grafts were rejected, with the exception of a rebound period at day 
+/- 22. In contrast, donor reactive cells were not deleted or inactivated in the 
thymus. Suppressor cell activity could only be detected in mice bearing 
long-term grafts. These results suggest that donor reactive cytotoxic cells are 
functionally inactivated in the spleen and nodes in the early and late stages of 
unresponsiveness after intrathymic injection of antigen. In contrast, donor 
reactive cells in the thymus do not appear to be affected."
7553078,"This paper reviews knowledge on the structure and function and evolution of the 
thyroid hormone binding protein transthyretin (TTR), with particular reference 
to factors affecting thyroid hormone distribution and delivery to the brain. The 
pool of thyroid hormones critical for the biological actions of the hormones is 
the pool of free thyroid hormone. The size of this pool is determined for short 
time periods by uptake/release of thyroid hormones into/from cell and 
binding/release of thyroid hormones by thyroid hormone-binding proteins. Both 
proportions and absolute concentrations of these proteins differ in blood plasma 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The most pronounced difference is found for TTR 
which is the only thyroid hormone-binding plasma protein synthesized in the 
brain. TTR is also distinct from the other two thyroid hormone-binding plasma 
proteins in humans by the absence of genetic deficiencies. TTR gene expression 
was initiated during evolution much earlier in the brain than in the liver. The 
structure of the domains of TTR involved in thyroxine (TR) T4 binding has been 
completely conserved for 350 million years. These observations point to a 
special functional significance of TTR in the brain. It is proposed that this is 
the determination of the level of free T4 in the extracellular compartment of 
the brain. T4 can then be converted in the brain to triiodothyronine T3 by 
specific deiodinases. This T3 can interact with receptors in the cell nuclei, 
regulating gene transcription.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7554113,"We report in the present study the effect of intrathecal treatment with 
antisense oligonucleotides complementary to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) 
receptor mRNA on the pressor response to intrathecal administration of TRH and 
on resting arterial blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously 
hypertensive rats (SHR). In 16-week-old male WKY rats, 18-base phosphodiester 
antisense or mismatch oligonucleotides to TRH receptor mRNA (100 micrograms per 
day) were injected intrathecally for 3 days. Twenty-four hours after the last 
injection, the magnitude of the pressor response to intrathecal TRH (10 
micrograms) was significantly smaller in the antisense-treated group (n = 7) 
compared with mismatch-treated controls (n = 7) (change in mean arterial 
pressure, +20.3 +/- 3.0 versus +32.6 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, P < .01). No differences 
were observed in the pressor responses to injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. 
Resting arterial blood pressure was unaffected by antisense treatment in WKY 
rats. In separate experiments, 16-week-old male SHR were treated with antisense 
(n = 7) or mismatch (n = 6) oligonucleotides for 3 days. Mean resting arterial 
blood pressure was significantly reduced by treatment with antisense 
oligonucleotides (from 157 +/- 4.8 to 119 +/- 8.8 mm Hg, P < .01), but no 
significant changes were observed in mismatch-treated animals. Our results 
suggest that the expression of TRH receptors in spinal sympathetic preganglionic 
neurons can be selectively reduced by intrathecal treatment with antisense 
oligonucleotides and that TRH projections to sympathetic preganglionic neurons 
play an important role in the elevation of arterial blood pressure in SHR."

7556180,"In order to analyze the role of thyroid hormones in mitochondrial biogenesis, we 
have studied the expression pattern of the beta subunit of the mitochondrial 
ATP-synthase complex in liver and in isolated mitochondria during postnatal 
development of hypothyroid rats. Chemically induced hypothyroidism promoted a 
significant reduction in body and liver masses at all stages of development. 
Furthermore, plasma 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and 
3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4) concentrations were significantly reduced 
in hypothyroid animals when compared to euthyroid animals. Remarkably, 
steady-state beta-F1-ATPase mRNA levels in livers of hypothyroid animals showed 
an approximately 50% reduction when compared to age-matched euthyroid rats at 
all stages of development. The relative amounts of beta-F1-ATPase protein 
determined in isolated mitochondria of 1-day-old and adult hypothyroid animals 
were similar to those determined in mitochondria of age-matched euthyroids, 
indicating that hypothyroidism does not affect organelle differentiation in the 
liver of suckling and adult rats. In contrast, the relative amount of 
beta-F1-ATPase protein in liver homogenates varied (0-30% reduction) due to the 
hypothyroid condition during development. These findings suggest the existence 
of compensatory mechanisms operating at the translational and/or 
post-translational levels which promote proliferation of mitochondria in the 
hypothyroid liver. However, when the liver mass was considered, hypothyroidism 
significantly reduced overall mitochondrial proliferation in rat liver. 
Interestingly, the effects of thyroid hormones on the biogenesis of the ATP 
synthase complex at latter stages of development provide an example in which the 
hypothyroid condition limits the expression of the nuclear-encoded gene with no 
apparent effect on the expression of the mitochondrial-encoded genes (ATP 
synthase subunits 6-8)."

(IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at 
Stanford. Eight children (aged 5-16.6 years), who were unable to tolerate 
medications by the oral route, received IV amitriptyline for a variety of 
indications, including neuropathic pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and as 
an adjuvant agent for opioid analgesia. One patient experienced an

7561689,"Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis frequently develop autoantibodies 
directed to gp210, a major glycoprotein of the nuclear pore complex. This 
protein contains a large glycosylated cisternal domain, a single transmembrane 
segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. It has been previously shown that 
autoantibodies from primary biliary cirrhosis patients exclusively react with 
the cytoplasmic tail. We demonstrate that autoantibodies against gp210 recognize 
at least two different epitopes. 4 out of 12 anti-gp210 positive sera reacted 
with the fragment consisting of the cytoplasmic tail, and 8 sera targeted a 
novel epitope located within the large glycosylated lumenal domain. Moreover, 
our data prove that carbohydrate moieties are an essential part of this novel 
epitope. We propose, therefore, that future screening assays should be performed 
with antigens possessing both epitopes to detect all sera with anti-gp210 
specificity."
7602797,"Pheochromocytomas synthesize and release catecholamines, which subsequently are 
related to various clinical manifestations of the disease. However, 
pheochromocytomas are not innervated and the catecholamine release and synthesis 
are not initiated by neural impulses. It is still unknown how catecholamine 
synthesis is regulated in pheochromocytomas. As a first step toward 
understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is 
controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the 
catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines 
in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands. The TH mRNA level was 
overexpressed and the catecholamine contents were high in 4 out of 6 
pheochromocytomas. There was a close correlation between the TH mRNA level and 
the catecholamines content in the tumors. We also examined the gene expression 
of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine 
beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in 
pheochromocytomas. The expression of these genes was in parallel with that of TH 
mRNA in the tumors. These findings indicate that catecholamine overproduction in 
pheochromocytomas is mediated by the overexpression of genes coding for 
catecholamines synthesizing enzymes, TH, DBH, and AADC."
7604973,"BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death is an essential event during mammalian 
morphogenesis which eliminates unnecessary cells to accomplish histogenesis and 
organogenesis. Cell death in interdigital spaces of the developing limb is a 
classical example of morphogenetic cell death. We investigated whether classical 
programmed cell death in the interdigital tissue of the developing limb in mice 
is apoptosis with fragmentation of nuclear DNA and also examined sequentially 
the occurrence of programmed cell death and cell proliferation in the developing 
limb of mouse fetuses to analyze their interrelation.
METHODS: We examined the occurrence of apoptotic cell death in the developing 
limbs of mouse fetuses by using Nile blue sulphate staining, agarose gel 
electrophoresis for detecting DNA laddering, and a cytochemical labeling of DNA 
fragmentation. We also labeled proliferating cells using BrdU/anti-BrdU 
immunohistochemistry and examined the interrelation between apoptotic programmed 
cell death and cell proliferation.
RESULTS: DNA ladders, a biochemical evidence of apoptosis, were detected in DNA 
extracts from the interdigital tissue of day 13 mouse fetuses by agarose gel 
electrophoresis. Programmed cell death and DNA fragmentation were detected by 
Nile blue staining and cytochemical labeling of DNA fragmentation, respectively, 
in the interdigital mesoderm and in the regions of presumptive joints of the 
digit. BrdU/anti-BrdU immunohistochemistry for identifying proliferating S-phase 
cells revealed that interdigital mesenchymal cells cease DNA synthesis before 
programmed cell death and DNA fragmentation begin.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that both cytological apoptotic alterations and 
fragmentation of nuclear DNA occur in the interdigital tissue and presumptive 
joint areas of fetal mouse limbs, and they appear to play a significant role in 
the separation of digits as well as the formation of joint cavities."

7608251,"3,5,3,'-Triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) has been used in therapy of resistance 
to thyroid hormone on an empirical basis and appears beneficial in some studies. 
We observed that the T3 analogs, Triac and 3,5,3'-triiodothyropropionic acid 
(Triprop), have a higher affinity for the thyroid hormone receptor-beta 1 (TR 
beta 1) than does T3 (2.7- and 1.8-fold, respectively), whereas the affinities 
of the three compounds for TR alpha 1 are the same. To evaluate whether T3 
analogs would have a differential effect on TR beta 1 and TR beta 1 mutants and 
thus be a specific treatment for patients with resistance to thyroid hormone, we 
examined the induction of the transcriptional activation of wild-type (wt) TR 
alpha 1, TR beta 1, and mutant TR beta 1s by T3, Triac, and Triprop. The dose 
response of transcriptional activation by T3 analogs was measured by transient 
cotransfections with TRs and a rat malic enzyme-TRE fused to thymidine kinase 
(TK)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in COS-1 cells. For TR alpha 1 wt, 
induction of CAT activity by T3 and Triac occurred at the same concentration. 
For TR beta 1 wt, Triac and Triprop showed a higher maximal activity than T3 
(Tripro > Triac > T3) and reached 50% induction at a lower concentration than T3 
(Tripro < Triac < T3). Induction of CAT activity in five mutant TR beta 1s 
(kindreds Mh, Mc, CL, Mf, and GH) was also analyzed. Even high levels of T3 
analogs could not restore CAT activity to that of TR beta 1wt for any mutant. A 
dominant negative effect was produced by Mh, Mc, and Mf. Mutants CL and GH had a 
mild dominant negative effect depending on T3 analog concentrations and TREs. 
Cotransfection studies were performed using a rat malic enzyme-TK-CAT reporter 
plasmid to analyze the effects of hormones at near-physiological concentrations 
of T3 and Triac. Triac had a significantly higher transcriptional activation 
than T3 in Mc, CL, and GH, suggesting that Triac would have a beneficial effect 
to different degrees for different mutant TR beta 1s. Using mutants Mc and GH, 
further studies were carried out using rat GH and double palindromic and 
inverted palindromic TREs in COS-1 cells. On each TRE, 10 nmol/L Triac induced 
higher transcriptional activation in TR beta 1wt, mutant TR beta 1s, and TR beta 
1wt plus mutant TR beta 1s (1:1 ratio) than the same dose of T3.(ABSTRACT

METHODS: We identified cases from the registries of relevant agencies and

RESULTS: Each victim collapsed with cardiac arrest immediately after an 
unexpected blow to the chest, which was usually inflicted by a projectile (such 
as a baseball or hockey puck). Incidents took place during organized competitive 
sports in 16 cases and in recreational settings at home, at school, or on the 
playground in 9. In each instance, the impact to the chest was not judged to be 
extraordinary for the sport involved and did not appear to have sufficient force 
to cause death. Twelve victims collapsed virtually instantaneously on impact, 
whereas 13 remained conscious and physically active for a brief time before 
cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered within about 
three minutes to 19 victims, but normal cardiac rhythm could be restored in only 
2 (both incurred irreversible brain damage and died shortly thereafter). Seven 
victims (28 percent) were wearing some form of protective chest padding.
CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that most sudden deaths related to impact to the chest 
(not associated with traumatic injury) are due to ventricular dysrhythmia 
induced by an abrupt, blunt precordial blow, presumably delivered at an 
electrically vulnerable phase of ventricular excitability. This profile of blunt 
chest impact leading to cardiac arrest adds to our understanding of the range of 
causes of sudden death on the athletic field and may help in the development of 
preventive measures."
7611299,"Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the 
extracellular microfibril, cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). This statement is 
supported by the observations that the classic Marfan phenotype cosegregates 
with intragenic and/or flanking marker alleles in all families tested and that a 
significant number of FBN1 mutations have been identified in affected 
individuals. We have now devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence 
and flanking splice junctions of FBN1. On completion for a panel of nine 
probands with classic MFS, six new mutations were identified that accounted for 
disease in seven (78%) of nine patients. Nine additional new mutations have been 
characterized in the early stages of a larger screening project. These 15 
mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene and, with one exception, 
were specific to single families. One-third of mutations created premature 
termination codons, and 6 of 15 substituted residues with putative significance 
for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Mutations 
causing severe and rapidly progressive disease that presents in the neonatal 
period can occur in a larger region of the gene than previously demonstrated, 
and the nature of the mutation is as important a determinant as its location, in 
predisposing to this phenotype."
7612897,"The family of protein kinases includes many oncogenes and growth factor 
receptors, many of which have been linked to the pathogenesis and progression of 
cancer. Protein tyrosine kinases such as HER-2/c-erbB-2 and the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) have been linked specifically to breast cancer, and 
perturbations of HER-2 affect response to chemotherapy. We have reviewed the 
biology of protein kinases in human breast cancer, as well as their 
translational applications to breast cancer patients. We have studied the 
spectrum of protein kinases expressed in human breast cancer cells and have 
identified four protein kinases with potentially important functions in breast 
cancer: rak (src-related), TK5 (which we now designate JAK3), the focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK), and STK1 (human M015/CAK). We describe the potential significance 
of these genes in breast cancer, as well as our methodology for identifying and 
characterizing novel genes in breast cancer."
7616230,"Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and 
aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. This 
hyperphosphorylated tau can be dephosphorylated at some of the abnormal 
phosphorylated sites by purified protein phosphatase-1, 2A, and 2B in vitro. In 
the present study, we have developed an assay to measure protein phosphatase 
activity toward tau-1 sites (Ser199/Ser202) using the hyperphosphorylated tau 
isolated from Alzheimer disease brain as substrate. Using this assay, we have 
identified that in normal brain, protein phosphatase-2A and 2B and, to a lesser 
extent, 1 are involved in the dephosphorylation of tau. The Km values of 
dephosphorylation of the hyperphosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A and 
2B are similar. The tau phosphatase activity is decreased by approximately 30% 
in brain of Alzheimer disease patients compared with those of age-matched 
controls. These findings suggest that a defect of protein phosphatase could be 
the cause of the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer disease."
7616241,"6R-L-erythro-Tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) is a cofactor for aromatic L-amino 
acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthase. Recently, we have reported that 
independently of its cofactor activities, 6R-BH4 acts from the outside of 
neurons in the brain to enhance the release of monoamine neurotransmitters such 
as dopamine. To characterize the pharmacological properties of the action, we 
examined the effects of 6S-BH4, a diastereoisomer of 6R-BH4, on dopamine release 
in the rat striatum by using brain microdialysis and compared its effects with 
those of 6R-BH4. Perfusion of 6S-BH4 or 6R-BH4 through the dialysis probe 
increased extracellular dopamine levels (an index of in vivo dopamine release) 
concentration dependently; the maximal increase by 6S-BH4, was one-sixth of that 
by 6R-BH4. 6S-BH4 increased extracellular DOPA levels in the presence of NSD 
1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (an index of in vivo 
tyrosine hydroxylase activity), to an extent similar to the increase induced by 
6R-BH4. The increase in the DOPA levels induced by either of the pteridines was 
abolished after pretreatment of rats with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (an inhibitor 
of tyrosine hydroxylase). Under the same conditions, the 6S-BH4-induced dopamine 
release was abolished, but most of the 6R-BH4-induced increase persisted. 
Coadministration of 6S-BH4 with 6R-BH4 inhibited the increase in dopamine 
release induced by 6R-BH4 alone. These results show that 6R-BH4 stimulates 
dopamine release by acting at the specific recognition site on the neuronal 
membrane, and that 6S-BH4 acts as an antagonist of 6R-BH4 at this site, although 
it has cofactor activities."
7620118,"Early in 1993, an unstable, expanded trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of 
unknown function was identified on HD chromosomes. This discovery unleased a 
flurry of experimentation that has established the expanded CAG repeat the 
almost universal cause of the characteristic neurologic symptoms and pathology 
of this neurodegenerative disorder of midlife onset. The biochemical basis for 
the specific neuronal loss of HD remains uncertain, but the genetic lesion 
probably acts via its consequent polyglutamine segment in the protein product, 
huntingtin. This review will describe the basic parameters of the HD repeat's 
behavior and the knowledge that has accumulated concerning its potential 
mechanisms of action."
7621840,"The incidence of vasodilation-related events (flushing, headache, dizziness and 
oedema) was determined in a total of 37,670 patients treated with diltiazem, 
nicardipine, isradipine or amlodipine and studied by Prescription-Event 
Monitoring between 1984 and 1991. Event rates are expressed as the percentage of 
patients who experienced these events during the six months after the first 
prescription. The rates for all these events with the newer vasoselective 
dihydropyridines (nicardipine, isradipine and amlodipine) were higher than those 
with diltiazem. Among the three dihydropyridines, there were large individual 
differences in the rates. With nicardipine, the frequency of each of the four 
vasodilation-related events were similar to one another (approximately 3%). With 
isradipine, the rates were also similar to one another but all were 
approximately twice those measured in the nicardipine study (approximately 6%). 
These differences may have been due to confounding factors such as the publicity 
about adverse drug reactions, the indication for use by individual patients or 
the doses actually being used at the time the event occurred. With amlodipine, 
in contrast, the rate for oedema was two to four times larger than the rates for 
flushing, headache or dizziness."
7622868,"In the early stages of apoptosis changes occur at the cell surface, which until 
now have remained difficult to recognize. One of these plasma membrane 
alterations is the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner side 
of the plasma membrane to the outer layer, by which PS becomes exposed at the 
external surface of the cell. Annexin V is a Ca2+ dependent phospholipid-binding 
protein with high affinity for PS. Hence this protein can be used as a sensitive 
probe for PS exposure upon the cell membrane. Translocation of PS to the 
external cell surface is not unique to apoptosis, but occurs also during cell 
necrosis. The difference between these two forms of cell death is that during 
the initial stages of apoptosis the cell membrane remains intact, while at the 
very moment that necrosis occurs the cell membrane looses its integrity and 
becomes leaky. Therefore the measurement of Annexin V binding to the cell 
surface as indicative for apoptosis has to be performed in conjunction with a 
dye exclusion test to establish integrity of the cell membrane. This paper 
describes the results of such an assay, as obtained in cultured HSB-2 cells, 
rendered apoptotic by irradiation and in human lymphocytes, following 
dexamethasone treatment. Untreated and treated cells were evaluated for 
apoptosis by light microscopy, by measuring the amount of hypo-diploid cells 
using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish 
whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed 
using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously 
with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The 
test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells 
(FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing 
traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The 
Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis 
before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the 
kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM 
will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may 
not be involved in the apoptotic process."
7623073,"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) was performed in 20 of 36 patients with 
glioma; 11 glioblastomas, 7 malignant astrocytomas, 2 benign astrocytomas. 
Twenty or 25 Gy of irradiation was delivered in a single fraction 
intraoperatively, followed by external beam irradiation. The electron beam 
energy was selected so that the 80% isodose line fell at 2 or 3 cm below the 
residual tumor surface. Median survival time of IORT group was 14 months and 
that of the control group was 10 months. Difference of survival curve was 
significant. There were 6 incidences of complication caused by IORT; 1 
radionecrosis, 1 convulsion, 1 abscess, and 3 severe brain edemas. IORT is 
suited for the treatment of malignant gliomas."
7624311,"Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means 
of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells. 
Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting 
the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, 
has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to 
efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene 
expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the 
interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect 
vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the 
transmission properties of a large number of different recombinant proviral 
genomes which vary both in the precise nature of vector, beta-globin structural 
gene, and locus control region (LCR) core sequences incorporated and in the 
placement and orientation of those sequences. Through this analysis, we 
identified one specific vector, termed M beta 6L, which carries both the human 
beta-globin gene and core elements HS2, HS3, and HS4 from the LCR and faithfully 
transmits recombinant proviral sequences to cells with titers greater than 10(6) 
per ml. Populations of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells transduced by this 
virus expressed levels of human beta-globin transcript which, on a per gene copy 
basis, were 78% of the levels detected in an MEL-derived cell line, Hu11, which 
carries human chromosome 11, the site of the beta-globin locus. Analysis of 
individual transduced MEL cell clones, however, indicated that, while expression 
was detected in every clone tested (n = 17), the levels of human beta-globin 
treatment varied between 4% and 146% of the levels in Hu11. This clonal 
variation in expression levels suggests that small beta-globin LCR sequences may 
not provide for as strict chromosomal position-independent expression of 
beta-globin as previously suspected, at least in the context of 
retrovirus-mediated gene transfer."
7625843,"Medicarpin, the major phytoalexin in alfalfa, is synthesized by way of the 
isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid metabolism. One of the final steps of 
medicarpin biosynthesis, from vestitone to 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanol, 
is catalyzed by vestitone reductase. A 1245-bp cDNA clone which encodes 
vestitone reductase was identified utilizing internal amino acid sequence of 
purified vestitone reductase. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the cloned 
enzyme exhibits strict substrate stereospecificity for (3R)-vestitone, as was 
observed for vestitone reductase purified from alfalfa. The calculated molecular 
weight of the protein (35,918) is similar to that of purified vestitone 
reductase from alfalfa (38 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The levels of vestitone reductase 
transcript (1.35 kb) greatly increase within 2 h of elicitor addition to alfalfa 
cell suspension cultures, preceding the rapid increases in vestitione reductase 
enzyme activity and medicarpin biosynthesis. In healthy alfalfa plants, the 
highest levels of transcripts were detected in roots and root nodules, 
consistent with the synthesis of medicarpin and its conjugate in these tissues. 
The cloning of the vestitone reductase gene provides a specific tool for the 
study and manipulation of pterocarpan biosynthesis in legumes."
7626141,"Transcriptional elongation involves dynamic interactions among RNA polymerase 
and single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids in the ternary complex. In 
prokaryotes its regulation provides an important mechanism of genetic control. 
Analogous eukaryotic mechanisms are not well understood, but may control 
expression of proto-oncogenes and viruses, including the human immunodeficiency 
virus HIV-1 (ref. 8). The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation 
factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or 
termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Two 
distinct domains of human TFIIS, which bind RNAPII and nucleic acids, regulate 
read-through and possibly nascent transcript cleavage. Here we describe the 
three-dimensional NMR structure of a Cys4 nucleic-acid-binding domain from human 
TFIIS. Unlike previously characterized zinc modules, which contain an 
alpha-helix, this structure consists of a three-stranded beta-sheet. Analogous 
Cys4 structural motifs may occur in other proteins involved in DNA or RNA 
transactions, including RNAPII itself. This new structure, designated the Zn 
ribbon, extends the repertoire of Zn-mediated peptide architectures and 
highlights the growing recognition of the beta-sheet as a motif of nucleic-acid 
recognition."
7627929,"Structural anomalies of the X chromosome, especially translocations, are rare 
events in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In a series of 2270 MDS patients 
analyzed between 1983 and 1994 (Center for Human Genetics, Leuven), 9 cases were 
found with translocations involving the X chromosome. These aberrations were not 
restricted to specific FAB subtypes and were the sole anomalies in 3 cases. In 
the remaining 6 patients, they were associated with other abnormalities, 
including 5q-, observed in three cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) was retrospectively performed on 8 patients and was shown to be a useful 
complement for the characterization of the translocations involving the X 
chromosome. In 3 cases, we could identify translocation partners and breakpoint 
regions only by using chromosome painting. No recurrent chromosome partners were 
observed. The breakpoints could be localized along the whole X chromosome. There 
was, however, a cluster in the Xq13 region involved in 4 of the 9 patients. The 
previously reported association of Xq13 anomalies with refractory anemia with 
ringed sideroblasts (RARS) was found in only one case. Despite the lack of 
characteristic translocations involving the X chromosome, the occurrence of such 
changes as the sole karyotypic anomaly suggests that they could play a role in 
the pathogenesis of some myelodysplastic syndromes."
7629231,"In systemic nonthyroidal illness (NTI), peripheral production of T3 from T4 is 
decreased, resulting in a decreased serum T3 concentration. We investigated 
whether factors in serum of NTI patients may play a role in this energy-saving 
adaptation mechanism. Metabolism of T4 and T3 by rat hepatocytes in primary 
culture was measured in the presence of 10% serum of normal subjects or of 
patients with NTI and related to the severity of disease. Patients with NTI were 
grouped according to serum thyroid hormone abnormalities: group I, serum rT3, 
T3, and T4 normal; group III, rT3 elevated, T3 decreased, T4 normal; group IV, 
rT3 elevated, T3 and T4 decreased. Compared with metabolism in the presence of 
normal serum, metabolism of T4 and to a lesser extent of T3 was progressively 
decreased in the presence of serum of patients of groups I-IV. A decreased net 
deiodination of T4 and T3 (corrected for differences in free hormone 
concentration) without an increase in conjugated T4 and T3 (corrected for 
differences in free hormone concentration) was observed, similar to results in 
experiments with compounds inhibiting transport into the cells and not the 
metabolic processes (5' deiodination) per se. Deiodination of T4 in vitro was 
correlated with serum T3 concentration of the patient (r = 0.69). Serum of 
patients with NTI influences thyroid hormone handling by hepatocytes comparable 
to the effect of transport inhibitors and not to that of the 5'-deiodinase 
inhibitor propylthiouracil, suggesting that decreased thyroid hormone transport 
over the cell membrane may play a role in lowered T3 production in NTI."
7629360,"Though it has been the subject of much research, burning mouth syndrome--a 
chronic oral-facial pain condition that affects many U.S. adults--remains poorly 
understood. It has been associated with numerous oral and systemic conditions. 
Treatment options frequently include various medications. While patients with 
symptoms of BMS are more likely to seek care from physicians, dentists should be 
involved in the evaluation and management of these patients."
7629529,"The yield of paraclinical tests was evaluated in a prospective study of 189 
consecutive patients referred for suspected multiple sclerosis (142 patients 
with multiple sclerosis, 47 non-multiple sclerosis patients on discharge). 
Patients were first classified according to the Poser criteria by the clinical 
findings. Subsequently, the results of paraclinical tests (cranial MRI, visually 
evoked potentials (VEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials by tibial nerve 
stimulation (SSEPs), motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and analysis of CSF for 
oligoclonal banding and IgG-index (CSF)) were taken into account. The percentage 
of reclassified patients (reclassification sensitivity, RS) was always lower 
than the percentage of abnormal results (diagnostic sensitivity, DS), and the 
divergence of RS v DS differed between the tests (60% v 84% in MRI, 31% v 77% in 
CSF, 29% v 37% in VEPs, 20% v 68% in MEPs, and 12% v 46% in SSEPs respectively). 
False reclassifications of non-multiple sclerosis patients to multiple sclerosis 
would have occurred with all tests (MRI: six of 47 patients, (reclassification 
specificity 88%); CSF: one (98%); VEPs: two (96%); MEPs: two (96%); SSEPs: four 
(91%); P < 0.05). Although MRI had superior diagnostic capacity, 57 of the 142 
patients with multiple sclerosis were not reclassified by the MRI result, 12 of 
whom were reclassified by CSF and 18 by one of the evoked potential (EP) 
studies. Of the 98 patients not reclassified by CSF, 53 were reclassified by MRI 
and 39 by EPs. The results suggest that for the evaluation of paraclinical tests 
in suspected multiple sclerosis, comparison of diagnostic sensitivities is 
inappropriate. In general, a cranial MRI contributes most to the diagnosis; 
however, due to its comparatively low specificity and its considerable number of 
negative results, EP or CSF studies are often useful to establish the diagnosis 
of multiple sclerosis."
7629986,"OBJECTIVE: In the assessment and management of the potentially poisoned patient 
with altered consciousness, the most consequential and controversial 
interventions occur during the first 5 minutes of care. In this review article, 
the risks and benefits of standard diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are 
presented to guide clinicians through this critical period of decision making.
DATA SOURCES: Data for discussion were obtained from a search of 
English-language publications referenced on MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 1994. 
Older literature was included when pertinent. Search terms included poisoning, 
overdose, toxicity, naloxone, glucose, thiamine, and flumazenil.
STUDY SELECTION: Only large trials were used for determinations of diagnostic 
utility and efficacy. Small trials, case series, and case reports were reviewed 
extensively for adverse effects.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Trials were reviewed for overall methodology, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, sources of bias, and outcome.
CONCLUSION: Analysis favors empirical administration of hypertonic dextrose and 
thiamine hydrochloride to patients with altered consciousness. Although rapid 
reagent test strips can be used to guide this therapy, they are not infallible, 
and they fail to recognize clinical hypoglycemia that may occur without 
numerical hypoglycemia. Administration of naloxone hydrochloride should be 
reserved for patients with signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication. Flumazenil 
is best left for reversal of therapeutic conscious sedation and rare select 
cases of benzodiazepine overdose."
7630199,"The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) inhibitor (p16INK4/MTS1/CDKN2) gene has 
been recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of the high 
frequency of homozygous deletion observed in numerous human tumor cell lines, 
including leukemias. However, results obtained from uncultured tumor samples 
have led to discussion of the relevance of these findings. Using reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot analysis, we 
have investigated p16INK4A gene at both RNA and genomic levels in various types 
of leukemias: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 23); acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(ALL) (n = 22) and B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPD) (n = 33). 
p16INK4A mRNA expression was not found in only 1/20 AML and 2/23 CLPD samples. 
Conversely, p16INK4A mRNA was not detected in 5/17 ALL cases, and intensity of 
PCR products were barely detectable in seven additional cases, possibly related 
to the contamination by normal cells in some cases. By Southern blotting, a 
homozygous deletion of p16INK4A gene was found in 6/17 ALL cases (35%) among 
which 4/6 were negative or weakly positive by RT-PCR assay. None of the five AML 
and 20 CLL samples studied had p16INK4A deletion. Sequence analysis of p16INK4A 
exon 2 did not show point mutation in two of these cases lacking mRNA 
expression. Our data provide further evidence that among hematological 
malignancies, ALL are the most likely to be associated with p16INK4A 
inactivation, mainly by homozygous gene deletion. Since most hematological 
malignancies-except ALL-are infrequently associated with p16INK4A and 
retinoblastoma (Rb) gene alteration it seems worthwhile to explore cdk4 and cdk6 
expression to determine whether or not the disruption of the 
p16INK4A/Rb/cdk4/cdk6 regulatory loop might play a role in their pathogenesis."
7630403,"The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome with facial 
abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes and mental retardation as the main 
clinical features. Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints 
in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 (refs 4-8). Here we report that 
all these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the 
human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a 
co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression. We show that RTS results 
not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 16p, but also from 
point mutations in the CBP gene itself. Because the patients are heterozygous 
for the mutations, we propose that the loss of one functional copy of the CBP 
gene underlies the developmental abnormalities in RTS and possibly the 
propensity for malignancy."
7630635,"The p15 and p16 CDK4 inhibitor genes map within the chromosome band 9p21 region 
deleted frequently in malignant mesothelioma and other cancers. p16 has been 
implicated recently as a potential target of 9p21 deletions in mesothelioma, but 
the role of this gene is uncertain because deletions have been detected more 
often in established cell lines than in primary tumor specimens. We determined 
p15 and p16 copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a P1 contig 
in 50 primary mesotheliomas. Codeletion of p15 and p16 was found in 72% of 
mesotheliomas, including all cases with spindle-cell components (n = 21) and 
total deletion of p15 and p16 was found in several mesotheliomas that lacked 
cytogenetic deletion of the chromosome 9 short arm. Point mutations were not 
found, however, in exon 2 of retained p15 and p16 alleles from seven 
mesotheliomas. These findings demonstrate that p15, p16 and/or a closely 
neighboring gene, are the targets of frequent chromosome 9p deletion in primary 
malignant mesothelioma."
7634390,"Although the human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is very sensitive 
to inactivation by O6-benzylguanine (BG) or 
2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (5-nitroso-BP), the equivalent 
protein formed by the carboxyl terminal domain of the product of the Escherichia 
coli ada gene (Ada-C) is unaffected by these inhibitors. This difference is 
remarkable in view of the substantial similarity between these proteins (33% of 
the residues in the common sequence are identical) and is potentially very 
important since these inhibitors are under development as drugs to enhance the 
anti-tumor activity of alkylating agents. In order to understand the reason for 
the resistance of the Ada-C protein, we have made chimeras between Ada-C and AGT 
sequences and mutations in the Ada-C protein, expressed the altered proteins in 
an E. coli strain lacking endogenous alkyltransferase activity and tested the 
inactivation of the resulting proteins by BG or 5-nitroso-BP. Chimeric 
alkyltransferase proteins were made in which the residues on the amino side of 
the cysteine acceptor site came from Ada-C and the residues on the carboxyl side 
came from AGT and vice versa but these did not show sensitivity to BG suggesting 
that resistance is produced by residues in both segments of the protein. 
Analysis of the Ada-C mutant proteins revealed two sites for mutations that 
confer sensitivity to these inhibitors. One of these was tryptophan-336 and the 
other was residues lysine-314 and alanine-316. Thus, when the combined mutations 
of A316P/W336A were made in the Ada-C sequence, the protein was sensitive to 
inactivation by BG. This A316P/W336A mutant protein was even more sensitive to 
5-nitroso-BP and the mutant proteins W336A, K314P/A316P and A316P could also be 
inhibited by this drug (in decreasing order of sensitivity) although the control 
Ada-C and a mutant R335S were not inhibited. These results provide strong 
support for the hypothesis that the resistance of the Ada-C alkyl-transferase is 
due to a steric effect limiting access to the active site. Insertion of proline 
residues at positions 314 and 316 and removal of the bulky tryptophan residue at 
position 336 increases the space available at the active site and permits these 
inhibitors to be effective."
7635469,"The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and the frequency of disease-causing 
mutations varies among different ethnic and geographic populations. The Jewish 
population around the world is comprised of two major ethnic groups; Ashkenazi 
and non-Ashkenazi. The latter is further classified according to country of 
origin. In this study, we analyzed the incidence of CF and the distribution of 
CF mutations in the general Jewish population in Israel and in most of the 
Jewish ethnic subgroups. The disease frequency varies considerably among the 
latter. Among Ashkenazi Jews, the frequency of CF is 1:3300, which is similar to 
the frequency in most Caucasian populations. Among non-Ashkenazi Jews, the 
disease occurs at a similar frequency among Jews from Libya (1:2700), Georgia 
(1:2700), Greece and Bulgaria (1:2400), but is rare in Jews from Yemen (1:8800), 
Morocco (1:15000), Iraq (1:32000), and Iran (1:39000). So far, only 12 mutations 
have been identified in Israeli Jews, and this enables the identification of 91% 
of the CF chromosomes in the entire Jewish CF population. However, in each 
Jewish ethnic group, the disease is caused by a different repertoire of 
mutations. The frequency of identified mutations is high in Ashkenazi Jews 
(95%), and in Jews originating from Tunisia (100%), Libya (91%), Turkey (90%), 
and Georgia (88%). However, a lower frequency of mutations can be identified in 
Moroccan (85%), Egyptian (50%), and Yemenite (0%) Jews. For genetic counseling 
of a Jewish individual, it is necessary to calculate the residual risk according 
to ethnic origin. Carrier screening of healthy Jewish individuals is currently 
feasible for Ashkenazi Tunisian, Libyan, Turkish, and Georgian Jews. These 
results provide the required information for genetic counseling of Jewish CF 
families and screening programs of Jewish populations worldwide."
7635945,"Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by delayed chylomicron and VLDL 
remnant catabolism and is associated with homozygosity for the apoE-2 allele. We 
have identified a kindred in which heterozygosity for an apoE mutant, apoE-1 
(Lys146-->Glu), is dominantly associated with the expression of type III 
hyperlipoproteinemia. DNA sequence analysis of the mutant apoE gene revealed a 
single-point mutation that resulted in the substitution of glutamic acid (GAG) 
for lysine (AAG) at residue 146 in the proposed receptor-binding domain of apoE. 
The pathophysiological effect of this mutation was investigated in vivo by 
kinetic studies in the patient and six normal subjects, and in vitro by binding 
studies of apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) to LDL receptors on human fibroblasts and to 
heparin. The kinetic studies revealed that apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) was catabolized 
significantly slower than apoE-3 in normals (P < 0.005). In the proband, the 
plasma residence times of both apoEs were substantially longer and the 
production rate of total apoE was about two times higher than in the control 
subjects. ApoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) was defective in interacting with LDL receptors, 
and its ability to displace LDL in an in vitro assay was reduced to 7.7% 
compared with apoE-3. The affinity of apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) to heparin was also 
markedly reduced compared with both apoE-2 (Arg158-->Cys) and apoE-3. These 
abnormal in vitro binding characteristics and the altered in vivo metabolism of 
apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) are proposed to result in the functional dominance of this 
mutation in the affected kindred."
7636511,"A multicenter international case-control study has been designed to elucidate 
the etiology of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). 
Although these diseases occur rarely, the morbidity is high and the mortality 
for TEN is of the order of 30%. These serious dermatologic conditions have often 
been linked to exposure to drugs. Infective and autoimmune diseases, as well as 
other non-drug risk factors, have also been postulated to be of importance in 
increasing the risk. The design and methods are described, with particular 
attention to the unique challenges for an epidemiologic study of these 
conditions."
7637580,"When cDNA containing proteins enriched in the bovine cerebellar cortex were 
cloned, a clone which seemed to encode a selenoprotein P-like protein was 
isolated. The coding nucleotide sequence of its cDNA insert displayed high 
homology to rat and human selenoprotein P cDNA but contained 12 rather than 10 
TGAs (12 rather than 10 selenocysteines in deduced amino acids), a tandem repeat 
of one CACTCC (His-Ser) and seven CATCCCs (His-Pro), and a 3' untranslated 
region approximately 890 bases shorter than that of rat liver selenoprotein P. 
RT-PCR using a set of primers flanking to the repeat displayed the existence of 
mRNA without the repeat. The tandem repeat and its adjacent region consisted of 
a similar motif of CAC/TCC/AC/T. Thus, these proteins included a (His-Pro) rich 
domain with a slightly negative free energy change irrespective of having the 
tandem repeat or not. Such His-Pro repeats reportedly exist in the segmentation 
gene paired or homeobox protein Om(1D) of Drosophila. Moreover, both this 
selenoprotein P-like protein mRNA and selenoprotein P mRNA were expressed in all 
the areas of the brain but most prominently in the cerebellar cortex, 
hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. These findings suggest the possibility that 
these selenoproteins are major selenium carriers in the brain and play a role in 
the morphological response of nerve or glial cells."
7638194,"Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA plays an important role in regulating 
gene expression during vertebrate embryonic development. Conversely, disruption 
of normal patterns of methylation is common in tumors and occurs early in 
progression of some human cancers. In vertebrates, it appears that the same DNA 
methyltransferase maintains preexisting patterns of methylation during DNA 
replication and carries out de novo methylation to create new methylation 
patterns. There are several indications that inherent signals in DNA structure 
can act in vivo to initiate or block de novo methylation in adjacent DNA 
regions. To identify sequences capable of enhancing de novo methylation of DNA 
in vitro, we designed a series of oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates with 
substrate cytosine residues in different sequence contexts. We obtained evidence 
that some 5-methylcytosine residues in these single-stranded DNAs can stimulate 
de novo methylation of adjacent sites by murine DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase 
as effectively as 5-methylcytosine residues in double-stranded DNA stimulate 
maintenance methylation. This suggests that double-stranded DNA may not be the 
primary natural substrate for de novo methylation and that looped 
single-stranded structures formed during the normal course of DNA replication or 
repair serve as ""nucleation"" sites for de novo methylation of adjacent DNA 
regions."
7640193,"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, 
relapsing facial paralysis, and fissured tongue. However, the classic triad is 
not frequently seen in its complete form. Monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic 
forms are more common. The histological findings of sarcoid-like granuloma in 
skin or mucosal biopsy specimens support the diagnosis. The course is chronic 
but benign. Treatment is difficult, but intralesional or systemic 
corticosteroids may be helpful."
7640201,"The focus of this article is acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, one of two disorders 
that have acquired the eponym Bazex syndrome. To date, all of the patients 
reported in the literature have had an underlying neoplasm, most commonly 
squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. In this review of 113 
cases of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (mean age, 61 years; 105 males, 8 
females), the psoriasiform lesions preceded the diagnosis of the associated 
malignancy in 73 (67%) of 109 patients, whereas the cutaneous manifestations 
followed the diagnosis of the neoplasm in only 16 (15%) of 109; in the 
remainder, the onset of the skin lesions and the diagnosis of the tumor occurred 
simultaneously. Therefore, awareness of the cutaneous signs of Bazex syndrome is 
of obvious importance to dermatologists. Evidence in favor of the paraneoplastic 
nature of this disease is as follows: in 81 (93%) of 87 patients with adequate 
clinical descriptions, the skin lesions either improved significantly (or 
resolved) when the underlying neoplasm was treated or they remained unchanged in 
the setting of persistent disease. Occasionally, the reappearance of skin 
lesions has signaled a recurrence of the tumor."
7641404,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both 
sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine 
neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and 
a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both 
the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET 
proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET 
proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic 
MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo 
MEN 2 cases.
DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were 
randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of 
MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral 
blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for 
polymerase chain reaction amplification.
MEASUREMENTS: Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was 
performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, 
within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur.
RESULTS: In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET 
codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus 
indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 
2B, was found.
CONCLUSIONS: A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC 
is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series 
involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline 
mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable 
disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to 
rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form 
of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively."
7642627,"We found that hydroxylation occurs at the C-2 position of adenine by oxygen 
radical treatment (Fe2+-EDTA) of dA, dATP, and single- and double-stranded DNA. 
This oxidatively damaged base, 2-hydroxyadenine, was produced 3-6-fold and 
40-fold less than 8-hydroxyguanine when monomers and polynucleotides, 
respectively, were treated. To determine whether the damaged nucleotide, 
2-hydroxydeoxyadenosine triphosphate (2-OH-dATP), is incorporated into a growing 
DNA, and to reveal the kinds of nucleotides opposite which 2-OH-dATP is 
incorporated, calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha and the Klenow fragment of 
Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were used in vitro DAN synthesis in the 
presence of 2-OH-dATP. DNA polymerase alpha incorporated the nucleotide opposite 
T and C in the DNA template. On the other hand, in an experiment using the 
Klenow fragment, incorporation of 2-OH-dATP was observed only opposite T. 
Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that incorporation of 2-OH-dATP by DNA 
polymerase alpha opposite T was favored over that opposite C by a factor of only 
4.5. These results indicate that 2-OH-dATP, an oxidatively damaged nucleotide, 
is a substrate for DNA polymerases and is incorporated incorrectly by the 
replicative DNA polymerase."
7642697,"Previous work with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has demonstrated a role 
for a phosphatidylinositol-specific PI 3-kinase, the product of the VPS34 gene, 
in the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to the vacuole, an organelle 
functionally equivalent to mammalian lysosomes (Schu, P. V., K. Takegawa, M. J. 
Fry, J. H. Stack, M. D. Waterfield, and S. D. Emr. 1993. Science [Wash. DC]. 
260:88-91). The activity of Vps34p kinase is significantly reduced by the PI 
3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, and LY294002, a quercetin 
analog (Stack, J. H., and S. D. Emr. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:31552-31562). We 
show here that at concentrations which inhibit VPS34-encoded PI 3-kinase 
activity, wortmannin also inhibits the processing and delivery of newly 
synthesized cathepsin D to lysosomes in mammalian cells with half-maximal 
inhibition of delivery occurring at 100 nM wortmannin. As a result of wortmannin 
action, newly synthesized, unprocessed cathepsin D is secreted into the media. 
Moreover, after accumulation in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) at 20 degrees C, 
cathepsin D was rapidly missorted to the secretory pathway after addition of 
wortmannin and shifting to 37 degrees C. At concentrations that inhibited 
lysosomal enzyme delivery, both wortmannin and LY294002 caused a highly specific 
dilation of mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-enriched vesicles of the 
prelysosome compartment (PLC), which swelled to approximately 1 micron within 15 
min after treatment. With increasing time, the inhibitors caused a significant 
yet reversible change in M6PR distribution. By 3 h of treatment, the swollen PLC 
vacuoles were essentially depleted of receptors and, in addition, there was a 
fourfold loss of receptors from the cell surface. However, M6PRs were still 
abundant in the TGN. These results are most consistent with the interpretation 
that PI 3-kinase regulates the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes by interfering 
with a M6PR-dependent sorting event in the TGN. Moreover, they provide evidence 
that trafficking of soluble hydrolases to mammalian lysosomes and yeast vacuoles 
rely on similar regulatory mechanisms."
7642698,"At present little is known of the biochemical machinery controlling transport of 
newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to 
endosomes. The demonstration that Vps34p (a protein required for targeting 
soluble hydrolases to the vacuole in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) suggested the possibility that a 
homologous enzyme might be involved in the equivalent step in mammalian cells. 
Using the PI3-K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, I provide evidence to 
support this hypothesis. Treatment of K-562 cells with wortmannin induced 
secretion of procathepsin D, with half-maximal inhibition of accurate targeting 
to lysosomes at 10-20 nM. Kinetic analysis indicated that a late Golgi (TGN) 
step was affected, and that other constitutive vesicular transport events were 
not. The M6P recognition signal was still generated in the presence of 
wortmannin suggesting that the drug was directly inhibiting export of the 
receptor-ligand complex from the TGN, while removal of the drug led to a rapid 
restoration of accurate sorting. At the concentrations used, wortmannin and 
LY294002 are presently accepted to be specific inhibitors of PI3-K. I conclude 
that these data implicate such an enzyme in the trafficking of 
M6P-receptor-ligand complexes from the TGN towards lysosomes."
7644247,"The hypoalgesic effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) at 
2 different frequencies was assessed under double-blind conditions using a 
standardised form of the submaximum effort tourniquet technique. For the purpose 
of pain induction, 32 healthy naive female subjects attended on 2 occasions, the 
first during which baseline data were obtained and the second during which the 
women were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups: Control, Placebo, TENS-1 (110 
Hz) or TENS-2 (4 Hz). In the treatment groups, 2 hydrogel electrodes were 
positioned over Erb's point and lateral to C6 and C7 vertebral spines. A TENS 
machine was applied for 10 min before the cuff was inflated and remained on for 
the duration of the pain procedure (12 min). Pain was measured using visual 
analogue scales (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to assess 'current 
pain intensity' and 'worst pain experienced', respectively. Analysis of VAS 
scores showed significant differences between groups (ANOVA, P = 0.02), with the 
TENS-2 group showing a greater hypoalgesic effect than the other groups. 
One-factor ANOVA showed no significant differences in MPQ scores between groups. 
The results of this study have provided evidence of the hypoalgesic effects of 
TENS upon experimental ischaemic pain which were found to be frequency specific 
with the lower frequency used here (4 Hz) demonstrating the only significant 
effect."
7649406,"The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene (c-Myc) is involved in the control of 
cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a transcription 
factor that recognizes the CACGTG motif. This sequence has also been found in 
the glucose-responsive elements of genes involved in the control of liver 
glycolysis and lipogenesis. To determine whether c-Myc can regulate hepatic 
carbohydrate metabolism in vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress c-myc under 
control of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter have been 
generated. These mice showed a threefold increase in c-Myc protein in liver 
nuclei. Hepatocytes from transgenic mice were normal and did not acquire the 
fetal phenotype. However, transgenic mice showed higher levels (threefold) of 
L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA and enzyme activity than control mice. The increase 
in pyruvate kinase activity led to a three- to fivefold increase in liver 
lactate content and a fivefold induction of lactate production by hepatocytes in 
primary culture. The expression of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase gene was also 
increased in the liver of these transgenic mice. The induction of hepatic 
glycolysis was related with an increase in the expression (about fourfold) and 
activity (about threefold) of liver glucokinase, whereas no change was noted in 
hexokinase-I. This change in glucokinase activity led to an increase in both 
glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen contents in the liver of transgenic mice. The 
expression of the liver-specific glucose transporter GLUT2 was also increased in 
transgenic mice, whereas no change was noted in the mRNA concentration of GLUT1. 
Furthermore, the changes of liver glucose metabolism led to a marked reduction 
of blood glucose (25%) and insulin (40%) concentrations in starvation, whereas 
the fall in both was only 10% in fed mice. Thus, liver glucose metabolism could 
determine the blood glucose and insulin set points in the transgenic mice. All 
these results indicated that the increase in c-Myc protein was able to induce 
liver glucose utilization and accumulation, and suggested that c-Myc 
transcription factor is involved in the control in vivo of liver carbohydrate 
metabolism."
7649555,"Two patients with classical features of Angel-man syndrome (AS) and one with 
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) had unbalanced reciprocal translocations involving 
the chromosome 15 proximal long arm and the telomeric region of chromosomes 7, 8 
and 10. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of 
chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to 
define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with 
library probes and telomere-specific probes). The 15(q11-13) region was not 
deleted in one patient but was deleted in the other two. The telomere on the 
derivative chromosomes 7, 8 and 10 was deleted in all three cases. Thus, these 
are true reciprocal translocations in which there has been loss of the small 
satellited reciprocal chromosome (15) fragment."
7651445,"Striatonigral degeneration (SND) is difficult to diagnose in vivo. The purpose 
of this study was to detect the best indicators for an early and reliable 
diagnosis of the disease. Eighteen patients clinically diagnosed as having SND 
were selected with rigorous inclusion criteria and compared to 18 patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD) matched for age and disease duration. Apart from 
dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished 
SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) 
severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral 
bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, 
and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon 
reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and 
less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive 
myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease."
7651715,"The paper deals with first trimester diagnosis of exencephaly. In association 
with first trimester sonographic and cytogenetic screening of chromosomal 
anomalies in 1145 examined pregnancies 2 exencephalic fetuses with normal 
karyotype were diagnosed. Exencephaly was characterized with the absence of 
normal echoes of the exocranium, the lateral ventricles, the chorioid plexus, 
the cerebral falx, and with the presence of deformed shape of the head and 
irregular, lobulated cerebral material with increasing volume at follow-up 
examination. Anencephalic fetuses were diagnosed subsequent to therapeutic 
abortion, since the uterine and cervical wall contractions eroded the fragile 
brain tissue during fetal expulsion. However, fetal brain was identified in 
abortion material in both cases providing evidence that exencephaly is an 
embryologic precursor of anencephaly."
7652577,"A mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was identified as a tumor-specific 
antigen recognized by HLA-A2. 1-restricted autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes 
(CTLs) in a human melanoma. The mutated CDK4 allele was present in autologous 
cultured melanoma cells and metastasis tissue, but not in the patient's 
lymphocytes. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was 
part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 
inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1. The same mutation was found in 
one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed. These results suggest that 
mutation of CDK4 can create a tumor-specific antigen and can disrupt the 
cell-cycle regulation exerted by the tumor suppressor p16INK4a."
7654063,"A novel point mutation in the ND6 subunit of complex I at position 14,459 of the 
mitochondrial DNA (MTND6*LDY T14459A) was identified as a candidate mutation for 
the highly tissue-specific disease. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy plus 
dystonia. Since the MTND6*LDYT14459A mutation was identified in a single family, 
other pedigrees with the mutation are needed to confirm its association with the 
disease. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic characterization is reported in two 
additional pedigrees. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy developed in two 
family members in one pedigree. The daughter had clinically silent basal ganglia 
lesions. In a second pedigree, a single individual presented with 
childhood-onset generalized dystonia and bilateral basal ganglia lesions. 
Patient groups that included individuals with Leigh's disease, dystonia plus 
complex neurodegeneration, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy did not 
harbor the MTND6*LDYT14459A mutation, suggesting that this mutation displays a 
high degree of tissue specificity, thus producing a narrow phenotypic range. 
These results confirm the association of the MTND6*LDYT14459A mutation with 
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and/or dystonia. As the first genetic 
abnormality that has been identified to cause generalized dystonia, this 
mutation suggests that nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA mutations in oxidative 
phosphorylation genes are important considerations in the pathogenesis of 
dystonia."
7656507,"Psychotic symptoms related to mental and medical disorders can pose a medical 
emergency. Selecting an appropriate antipsychotic medication to treat this 
emergency is based on the clinical situation, preferred route of administration, 
pharmacokinetic profile of the antipsychotic and the medications currently being 
taken by the patient. Intramuscular preparations are usually preferred over oral 
medication when the patients are not co-operative and require drugs with a 
faster onset of action and good bioavailability. High potency antipsychotics 
such as haloperidol and fluphenazine are effective in stabilising patients with 
psychotic symptoms quickly. Loxapine is an alternative when sedation is 
necessary and molindone is useful if a short-acting antipsychotic is required. 
Rapid neuroleptisation with intramuscular preparations of antipsychotic achieves 
therapeutic drug concentrations more rapidly, and also provides optimal control 
of psychotic symptoms. If the patient is cooperative, liquid oral preparations 
can be used; they are as effective as intramuscular formulations. If long term 
treatment with an antipsychotic in necessary and patients are stabilised, they 
can be switched from intramuscular to oral preparations. The oral dose is 
usually 1.5 to 5 times the total intramuscular dose per day, based on the 
bioavailability of the antipsychotic medication. If the patient is currently 
taking antipsychotic medication when the emergency situation occurs, it is 
usually adequate to increase the dose of antipsychotic drug. Appropriate dose 
adjustment or antipsychotic selection is necessary when drug interactions are 
expected. An in-depth knowledge of the pharmacokinetic profile and drug 
interaction profile of antipsychotic in necessary for the selection of the 
appropriate antipsychotic for any given emergency situation."
7662116,"We examined the role of the O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase encoded by ogt 
gene in the sensitivity of Escherichia coli to the mutagenic effects of the 
dibromoalkanes, dibromoethane and dibromomethane, by comparing responses in ogt- 
bacteria to those in their isogenic ogt+ parental counterparts. The effects of 
the uvrABC excision-repair system, the adaptive response, mucAB and umuDC 
mutagenic processing, and glutathione bioactivation on the differential 
responses of ogt- and ogt+ bacteria were also studied. Mutation induction was 
monitored by measuring the frequency of forward mutations to L-arabinose 
resistance. Induced mutations occurred only in excision repair-defective strains 
and were totally (with dibromomethane) or substantially (with dibromoethane) 
dependent on the alkyltransferase (ATase) encoded by the ogt gene. An increased 
mutagenic response to both dibromoalkanes was also seen in ogt- bacteria that 
overexpressed the ogt protein from a multicopy plasmid, indicating that the 
differences in mutability between ogt+ and ogt- bacteria were not dependent on 
the ogt- null allele carried by the defective strain. The ATase encoded by the 
constitutive ogt gene was more effective in promoting dibromoalkane mutagenicity 
than the ada ATase induced by exposure to low doses of a methylating agent. The 
mutagenicity promoted by the ogt ATase was dependent on both glutathione 
bioactivation and SOS mutagenic processing. To our knowledge, this paper 
presents for the first time evidence that DNA ATases, in particular the ATase 
encoded by the ogt gene, can increase the mutagenic effects of a DNA-damaging 
agent. The mechanism of this effect has yet to be established."
7662576,"Topical photochemotherapy with psoralen and its derivatives 
4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), with UVA 
irradiation, was evaluated with regard to minimum phototoxic dose, 
concentration, timing of UVA irradiation and systemic and local side-effects, in 
healthy volunteers. Psoralen (0.005%) in aqueous gel was found to be superior to 
TMP and 8-MOP in aqueous gel. No hyperpigmentation was seen after topical PUVA 
treatment with psoralen in aqueous gel. Patients with plaque-type psoriasis (n = 
7), palmoplantar psoriasis (n = 7) and hyperkeratotic eczema (n = 2) were 
treated. Topical PUVA therapy was effective in most psoriasis patients, without 
the occurrence of local or systemic side-effects. Moreover, hyperkeratotic 
eczema patients who did not respond to conventional therapy showed partial 
remission. These results indicate that topical PUVA therapy with psoralen in 
aqueous gel is a useful therapeutic modality for treatment of psoriasis 
patients, and patients with recalcitrant dermatoses such as palmoplantar 
psoriasis and hyperkeratotic eczema."
7664818,"Using adrenal dopamine as indicator we have previously obtained evidence that 
quinpirole and several other agonists on dopamine D2-like receptors acutely 
stimulate the synthesis of adrenal catecholamines. In the present study we 
measured the effect of quinpirole and dopamine on the hydroxylation of tyrosine 
in the adrenals, using the method of DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) 
accumulation following the administration of the inhibitor of aromatic L-amino 
acid decarboxylase NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazyne). In view of the large 
amounts of catecholamines in the adrenal tissue samples, this necessitated a 
modification of the method for analysing DOPA. Both quinpirole and dopamine 
significantly enhanced the rate of DOPA accumulation in the adrenals, indicating 
stimulation of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. The effect of dopamine was blocked 
by domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that penetrates poorly into 
the central nervous system. Thus the effect of dopamine, which itself penetrates 
poorly into the central nervous system, was presumably mediated peripherally. 
Similarly epinine, i.e. the N-methyl derivative of dopamine, appeared to enhance 
adrenal catecholamine synthesis, as indicated by an elevated adrenal dopamine 
level. The data support the view that stimulation of peripherally located 
dopamine D2-like receptors can enhance the rate of adrenal catecholamine 
synthesis by stimulating the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase."
7666054,"Adult human nerve cells contain tau protein, a phosphorylated 
microtubule-associated protein, that is hyperphosphorylated in the fetus and in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the 
microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance 
the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary 
tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we use phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau 
antibodies to detect specific epitopes that characterize hyperphosphorylated 
tau. Our demonstration of intracellular tangles containing full-length tau that 
are not immunolabeled by these antibodies suggests that hyperphosphorylation of 
tau is not obligatory in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's 
disease."
7666455,"Chromosomal changes through pericentric inversions play an important role in the 
origin of species. Certain pericentric inversions are too minute to be detected 
cytogenetically, thus hindering the complete reconstruction of hominoid 
phylogeny. The advent of the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique 
has facilitated the identification of many chromosomal segments, even at the 
single gene level. Therefore the cosmid probe for Prader-Willi (PWS)/Angelman 
syndrome to the loci on human chromosome 15 [q11-13] is being used as a marker 
to highlight the complementary sequence in higher primates. We hybridized 
metaphase chromosomes of chimpanzee (PTR), gorilla (GGO), and orangutan (PPY) 
with this probe (Oncor) to characterize the chromosomal segments because the 
nature of these pericentric inversions remains relatively unknown. Our 
observations suggest that a pericentric inversion has occurred in chimpanzee 
chromosome (PTR 16) which corresponds to human chromosome 15 at PTR 16 band 
p11-12, while in gorilla (GGO 15) and orangutan (PPY 16) the bands q11-13 
complemented to human chromosome 15 band q11-13. This approach has proven to be 
a better avenue to characterize the pericentric inversions which have apparently 
occurred during human evolution. ""Genetic"" divergence in the speciation process 
which occurs through ""chromosomal"" rearrangement needs to be reevaluated and 
further explored using newer techniques."
7666681,"Ebstein's anomaly is characterised by downward displacement of the tricuspid 
valve into the right ventricle. The most deformed leaflets are the septal and 
mural ones. The abnormally situated tricuspid orifice produces a portion of the 
right ventricle lying between the atrioventricular ring and the origin of the 
valve. This proximal segment is atrialized. Commonly associated anatomical 
defects include a atrial septal second defect, a ventricular septal defect, 
pulmonary stenosis or atresia, and mitral valve prolapse. An accessory 
conduction pathway (Wolf-Parkinson White syndrome) was found in this 
malformation. It is thought that this malformation is due to a direct 
teratogenic effect of lithium on the atrioventricular junction. Ebstein's 
anomaly can be accurately identified by echocardiography and angiography."

7673371,"Changes in serotonin-2 receptors have been demonstrated in brain autopsy 
material from patients with various neurodegenerative and affective disorders. 
It would be desirable to locate a ligand for the study of these receptors in 
vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). Altanserin is a 
4-benzoylpiperidine derivative with a high affinity and selectivity for S2 
receptors in vitro. Dynamic PET studies were carried out in nine normal 
volunteers with high-specific activity (376-1,680 mCi/mumol) [18F]altanserin. 
Arterial blood samples were obtained and the plasma time-activity curves were 
corrected for the presence of labeled metabolites. Thirty minutes after 
injection, selective retention of the radioligand was observed in cortical 
areas, while the cerebellum, caudate, and thalamus had low radioactivity levels. 
Specific binding reached a plateau between 30 and 65 min postinjection at 1.8% 
of the injected dose/L of brain and then decreased, indicating the reversibility 
of the binding. The total/nonspecific binding ratio reached 2.6 for times 
between 50 and 70 min postinjection. The graphical analysis proposed by Logan et 
al. allowed us to estimate the binding potential (Bmax/KD). Pretreatment with 
ketanserin was given to three volunteers and brain activity remained uniformly 
low. An additional study in one volunteer showed that [18F]altanserin can be 
displaced from the receptors by large doses of ketanserin. At the end of the 
study, unchanged altanserin was 57% of the total plasma activity. These results 
suggest that [18F]altanserin is selective for S2 receptors in vivo as it is in 
vitro. They indicate that [18F]altanserin is suitable for imaging and 
quantifying S2 receptors with PET in humans."
7673463,"The present study provides a survey of the immunolocalization of ionotropic 
glutamate receptor subunits throughout the rat and cat cerebellar cortex, with 
emphasis on the unipolar brush cell (UBC), a hitherto neglected cerebellar cell 
that is densely concentrated in the granular layer of the vestibulocerebellum 
and that forms giant synapses with mossy fibers. An array of nine previously 
characterized antibodies has been used, each of which stained a characteristic 
profile of cerebellar cells. The UBCs of both rat and cat were strongly 
immunostained by an antibody against the 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate (AMPA) receptor subunits, 
GluR2 and GluR3; were moderately immunostained by a monoclonal antibody to 
kainate receptor subunits, GluR5/6/7; were weakly immunostained by antibodies to 
NR1 subunits; and were not stained by antibodies to GluR1, GluR4, GluR6/7, KA-2, 
and NR2A/B. Postsynaptic densities of the giant mossy fiber-UBC synapses were 
GluR2/3, GluR5/6/7, and NR1 immunoreactive. The other cerebellar neurons were 
all immunolabeled to some extent with the GluR2/3 and NR1 antibodies. In 
addition, Purkinje cells were immunopositive for GluR1 and GluR5/6/7; granule 
cells were immunopositive for GluR5/6/7, GluR6/7, KA-2, and NR2A/B. The 
Golgi-Bergmann glia was densely stained by GluR1 and GluR4 antibodies, whereas 
astrocytes of the granular layer were stained by the GluR4 antiserum. Data 
provided herein may guide further electrophysiological and pharmacological 
studies of cerebellar cells in general and the UBCs in particular."
7674025,"The authors report an unusual case of a 2-year-old boy with a 3-month history of 
episodic rightward anterolateral head tilt and large-amplitude positional 
anteroposterior head bobbing reminiscent of bobble-head doll syndrome. This 
child experienced a sudden onset of drop attacks and then, within several hours, 
deep coma. The causative lesion was a contrast-enhancing, partially cystic third 
ventricular mass, which ultimately obstructed the aqueduct, producing profound 
obstructive hydrocephalus. An emergency ventriculostomy and endoscopic 
fenestration of the septum pellucidum was performed. Four days later, the tumor 
was completely resected by a transcallosal-transforaminal approach. The lesion 
was freely mobile within the third ventricle and contained a large cyst within 
its posterior pole; following drainage of the cyst, the lesion was easily 
delivered through the foramen of Monro. The histopathological diagnosis was 
choroid plexus papilloma. The child's neurological deficits, head tilt, and head 
bobbing resolved immediately after operation. To the best of the authors' 
knowledge, this represents the first well-documented report of bobble-head doll 
syndrome and drop attacks secondary to a choroid plexus papilloma. The highly 
mobile nature of the cystic lesion presumably led to its intermittent impaction 
within the foramen of Monro and/or proximal aqueduct; this produced the 
intermittent head tilt and bobble-head symptoms and, ultimately, resulted in 
acute obstruction of the aqueduct, causing the child's precipitous neurological 
decline."
7676521,"Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) may present with a broad spectrum of 
symptoms three to six weeks after primary infection by Schistosoma (S) mansoni, 
S. japonicum or, more rarely, S. haematobium. The acute phase of schistosomiasis 
is frequently confused with other feverish diseases. It occurs almost 
exclusively in nonimmune visitors to endemic areas. We describe seven cases of 
acute S. mansoni infection. The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and 
treatment are briefly discussed. Katayama fever should be considered in patients 
returning from endemic areas with fever and eosinophilia. Clinically normal, but 
potentially exposed travel companions should be examined as well. Early 
diagnosis and treatment may be important in preventing the infection's serious 
sequelae of the infection."
7678183,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been shown to have certain catabolic 
effects on fat cells and whole animals. An induction of TNF-alpha messenger RNA 
expression was observed in adipose tissue from four different rodent models of 
obesity and diabetes. TNF-alpha protein was also elevated locally and 
systemically. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in obese fa/fa rats caused a 
significant increase in the peripheral uptake of glucose in response to insulin. 
These results indicate a role for TNF-alpha in obesity and particularly in the 
insulin resistance and diabetes that often accompany obesity."
7678251,"The leukocyte integrin p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) is involved in a number of cell-cell 
and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and mediates signal transduction into 
the cytoplasm. p150,95 is expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage as well as 
on certain activated T and B lymphocytes, and its expression is regulated during 
cell activation and differentiation. Since CD18 is expressed on all leukocyte 
lineages, the restricted expression of p150,95 must be controlled at the level 
of CD11c gene transcription. To understand the mechanisms that direct the 
constitutive and regulated leukocyte expression of p150,95 we have structurally 
characterized the CD11c promoter region and initiated its functional dissection. 
The CD11c promoter lacks TATA- and CCAAT-boxes, directs the synthesis of 
transcripts with heterogeneous 5'-ends, and contains an initiator-like sequence 
at the major transcription initiation site. Several putative binding sequences 
for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) 
transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c 
promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. 
Transient expression of CD11c-based reporter gene constructs indicates that the 
CD11c promoter dictates the tissue-specific expression of p150,95 and that 
sequences contained within 160 base pairs 5' from the major transcriptional 
start site are involved in the tissue-specific and regulated expression of 
p150,95. DNase I protection analysis on the promoter region spanning from -160 
to +40 revealed four regions of DNA-protein interactions (FPI-FPIV), two of 
which (FPII and FPIV) correlate with the cell type-specific and regulated 
expression of the CD11c gene."
7678416,"Ternary complexes of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase containing 3'-OMeGMP-arrested 
transcripts were purified by native gel electrophoresis. These complexes resumed 
elongation in situ when gel slices were incubated with magnesium and NTPs. 
Elongation occurred in the absence of pyrophosphate, suggesting that the 
blocking 3'-OMeGMP residue was removed via a novel pathway. We show that 
purified elongation complexes contain an intrinsic nuclease activity that 
shortens nascent RNA from the 3'-end. RNA cleavage was absolutely dependent on a 
divalent cation and was stimulated by CTP. The initial 5' cleavage product 
remained associated with the ternary complex and could be elongated in the 
presence of NTPs. Multiple stepwise cleavages generated progressively shorter 
chains. Purified ternary complexes containing 3'-OH-terminated RNAs also 
displayed nuclease activity. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit 
rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence 
similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription 
factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1991) 
J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800)."
7678559,"We previously identified novel human ets-1 transcripts in which the normal order 
of exons is inverted, and demonstrated that although the order of exons is 
different than in the genomic DNA, splicing of these exons out of order occurs 
in pairs using genuine splice sites (1). Here we determine the structure of 
these novel transcripts, showing that they correspond to circular RNA molecules 
containing only exons in genomic order. These transcripts are stable molecules, 
localized in the cytoplasmic component of the cells. To our knowledge, this is 
the first case of circular transcripts being processed from nuclear pre-mRNA in 
eukaryotes. This new type of transcript might represent a novel aspect of gene 
expression and hold some interesting clues about the splicing mechanism."
7678762,"The genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanin, phycocyanin 
and phycoerythrin from the red alga Aglaothamnion neglectum were isolated and 
characterized. While the operons containing the different phycobiliprotein genes 
are dispersed on the plastid genome, the genes encoding the alpha and beta 
subunits for each phycobiliprotein are contiguous. The beta subunit gene is 5' 
for both the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin operons, while the alpha subunit gene 
is 5' for the allophycocyanin operon. The amino acid sequences of A. neglectum 
phycobiliproteins, as deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the genes, are 
65-85% identical to analogous proteins from other red algae and cyanobacteria. 
The conserved nature of the plastid-encoded red algal and cyanobacterial 
phycobiliprotein genes supports the proposed origin of red algal plastids from 
cyanobacterial endosymbionts. Many environmental factors effect phycobilisome 
biosynthesis. The effect of both nutrient availability and light quantity on the 
level of A. neglectum phycobiliprotein subunits and the mRNA species encoding 
those subunits is described."
7679525,"A 42 year old man, treated for testicular carcinoma with combination 
chemotherapy that included bleomycin, developed life threatening interstitial 
pneumonitis. He recovered successfully after treatment with very high doses of 
corticosteroids and azathioprine. This report suggests that bleomycin lung 
toxicity may be reversible if treated aggressively."
7679743,"Numerous studies have demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses 
bears major determinants of pathogenesis. To elucidate the antigenic structure 
of the protein, a panel of monoclonal antibodies was studied by competitive 
ELISA, and their reactivities were assayed against fragments of the murine 
coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain A59 S gene expressed in prokaryotic 
vectors. An immunodominant linear domain was localized within the predicted 
stalk, S2, of the peplomer. It is recognized by several neutralizing antibodies. 
Other domains were also identified near the proteolytic cleavage site, in the 
predicted globular head, S1, and in another part of the stalk. Furthermore, 
competition results suggest that the immunodominant functional domain forms part 
of a complex three-dimensional structure. Surprisingly, some antibodies which 
have no antiviral biological activities were shown to bind the immunodominant 
neutralization domain."
7679772,"To clarify the clinico-pathological characteristic of poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma of gastric cancer with medullary growth pattern, the 
immunohistochemical study was performed using antibodies against blood group 
related antigens (Lewis(a), Lewis(b), Lewis(x), Lewis(y)) and gastrointestinal 
tissue related antigens (CEA, AFP and NSE). The following results were obtained. 
1. Foveolar epithelium of normal gastric mucosa has type 1 blood group 
associated antigen (Lewis(a), Lewis(b)) and deep gland has type 2 antigen 
(Lewis(x), Lewis(y)) respectively, as the differentiation antigens. 2. 
Expression of Lewis(a) and Lewis(b) are more often observed in poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma with medullary and scirrhous growth pattern than 
in well and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinomas postulated to have closer relation with normal gastric deep 
gland in terms of antigen expression. 3. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma 
with medullary growth pattern is characterized as more differentiated type 
cancer than scirrhous type with respect to expression of blood group related 
antigen. 4. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with medullary growth pattern 
may be divided into 3 subgroups by each antigen expression of CEA, NSE, and AFP."
7679991,"In this study we investigated bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity in patients 
with germ-cell tumour by means of technetium-99m diethylene triamine 
penta-acetic acid aerosol scintigraphy. Twenty untreated patients who had no 
clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary disease received four courses of 
etoposide, cisplatin and bleomycin chemotherapy. Aerosol lung scintigraphy and 
pulmonary function tests were performed in all patients before bleomycin 
treatment and after administration of 180 and 360 mg bleomycin. On the basis of 
the scintigrams the percentage decline in activity per minute (Kep) was 
evaluated, which represented an accurate parameter of lung membrane 
permeability. Pretreatment Kep values (0.891 +/- 0.286) were significantly lower 
than those obtained following 180 and 360 mg bleomycin treatment (1.176 +/- 
0.336 and 1.389 +/- 0.477, respectively; P < 0.0005). The Kep values obtained 
with 180 and 360 mg bleomycin treatments were also significantly different (P < 
0.005). In contrast, no significant change was observed in the results of 
pulmonary function tests. Our results demonstrate that evaluation of the 
pulmonary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA represents a useful means of monitoring the 
functional status of the lung epithelial membrane during bleomycin treatment. 
Further prospective studies are needed to assess the relationship between 
increase in permeability and development of lung toxicity in order to decide 
which patients should discontinue bleomycin therapy."
7681065,"B1 and Alu are sequence-homologous interspersed elements of unknown function 
that have expanded in the genomes of mice and humans, respectively. A minority 
of B1 and Alu sequences are expressed as small cytoplasmic RNAs. These RNAs have 
conserved a secondary structure motif also present in signal recognition 
particle (SRP) RNA despite substantial sequence divergence, whereas random B1 
and Alu sequences have not. This RNA structure has also been conserved by the 
source sequences that gave rise to successive transpositions during B1 and Alu 
evolution. In the present work small cytoplasmic B1 and Alu RNAs synthesized in 
vitro were found to bind a cellular protein by mobility shift and UV 
cross-linking analyses. The mouse and human proteins demonstrate the same 
specificity to a panel of competitor RNAs. Results using mutated B1 RNA indicate 
that a single strand loop in the conserved Alu motif is essential for binding. 
Previous work by Strub et al. (Stub, K., Moss, J. B., and Walter, P. (1991) Mol. 
Cell. Biol. 11, 3949-3959) demonstrated that the Alu-specific protein SRP 9/14 
does not footprint to this region of SRP RNA. This observation coupled with the 
failure of anti-SRP/9 antibodies to identify SRP 9/14 in the B1 RNA-protein 
complex as well as the apparent mass and other characteristics of the protein 
described here suggest that it is a novel B1-Alu RNA-binding protein. 
Conservation of primary and secondary structure by B1 and Alu small cytoplasmic 
RNAs as well as features of their specific expression and ability to interact 
with the conserved binding protein indicate that these RNAs are more homologous 
than previously appreciated."
7683090,"DNA double-strand breaks are considered to be the most deleterious lesion 
induced by ionizing radiation. However, the mechanism of rejoining of these 
lesions has not been extensively studied at the molecular level. We have used a 
shuttle vector, pHAZE, to analyze the mechanism of rejoining of DNA 
double-strand breaks in human cells. The advantage of this vector system is 
that, unlike many previously described shuttle vectors, it has a large target 
gene for the detection of deletions and it is maintained as a freely replicating 
episome with chromatin conformation in the nucleus of human cells. In this study 
we compare data obtained on the spectrum of mutations induced in pHAZE by 
ionizing radiation (alpha-particles) and restriction enzymes (PvuII, ClaI, and 
PvuI). Unlike ionizing radiation, restriction enzymes induce double-strand 
breaks in DNA with known end structures at defined locations and therefore 
provide a model system for analyzing cellular responses to DNA double-strand 
breaks. Exposure of human cells containing the vector to alpha-particle 
irradiation produced both point mutations and large deletions in pHAZE. When the 
junction regions of the deletions were sequenced it was found that 65% were 
rejoined with up to 6 bp of homology at the junction region. Analysis of 
restriction-enzyme-induced mutations suggests that double-strand break ends are 
modified to facilitate rejoining and that the type of modification is 
characteristic for different end structures. Double-strand breaks with cohesive 
ends appear to have fewer modifications introduced at the break points before 
rejoining than breaks with blunt ends. When considered in relation to the data 
obtained with ionizing radiation this suggests that the presence of cohesive 
sequences either at, or in proximity to, the ends enhances rejoining of DNA 
double-strand breaks."
7683649,"Gas vesicle synthesis in Haloferax mediterranei involves several gene products 
encoded by a 9.4-kilobase pair DNA region (mc-vac region) that contains 13 genes 
in addition to gvpA encoding the major structural gas vesicle protein. The 
expression of part of this region, encompassing the genes gvpA, gvpC, gvpN, and 
gvpO was investigated. These genes are transcribed from a common promoter 
located upstream of gvpA. Transcripts of 0.34 (gvpA only), 1.8 (gvpA/C), 2.4 
(gvpA/C/N) and 3 kilobases (gvpA/C/N/O) were observed, with the gvpA transcript 
being the predominant mRNA species. The majority of the mRNA formed terminates 
64 base pairs downstream of gvpA at the cytosine of the sequence 5' TTTTTC 3'. 
The synthesis of the GvpA and GvpC proteins was investigated by Western 
analyses. An antiserum raised against isolated gas vesicles of Hf. mediterranei 
detects, in addition to gas vesicle fragments, the GvpA protein of the M(r) of 
approximately 8,000 in lysates derived from different halobacteria or from 
Escherichia coli expressing gvpA. In samples containing isolated gas vesicles, 
mainly partially disaggregated gas vesicle fragments hybridize, but a minor 
amount of monomeric GvpA is also seen. For the detection of the GvpC protein, 
two versions of the gvpC gene (full length and gvp delta C lacking the 3' part 
encoding the acidic C terminus) were expressed in E. coli, and the resulting 
proteins were purified. The two antisera raised against these GvpC versions 
indicate the expression of gvpC in different halobacteria. By Western analysis, 
GvpC is also detectable in samples containing isolated gas vesicles 
demonstrating that GvpC is a second, but minor, gas vesicle structural protein."
7684656,"Sry is expressed at higher levels in the adult testis, where no function has 
been determined, than in the genital ridge, its critical site of action. cDNA 
and 5' RACE clones isolated from testis or from Sry-transfected cell lines have 
an unusual structure, with 3' sequences located in a 5' position. RNAase 
protection assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions confirmed 
that these unusual RNA molecules represent the most abundant transcript in 
testis. Furthermore, oligonucleotide hybridization and RNAase H digestion proved 
that these Sry RNA molecules are circular. Similar transcripts were detected in 
the testes of mice with Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus, and Mus 
spretus Sry genes. The circular RNA is found in the cytoplasm but is not 
substantially bound to polysomes. We suggest that the circles arise from normal 
splicing processes as a consequence of the unusual genomic structure surrounding 
the Sry locus in the mouse."
7684712,"Analysis of lineage segregation during mammalian neural crest development has 
not been sufficiently performed due to technical difficulties. In the present 
study, therefore, we established a clonal culture system of mouse neural crest 
cells in order to analyze developmental potentials of individual neural crest 
cells and their patterns of lineage segregation. 
12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin (CT) were applied 
to culture medium to trigger melanogenic differentiation of mouse neural crest 
cells. Three morphologically distinct types of clones were observed. (1) 
""Pigmented clones"" consisted of melanocytes only, suggesting that the 
clone-forming cells were committed to the melanogenic lineage. These clones were 
observed only in the presence of TPA and CT. The proportion of this type of 
clone (8%) was much lower than that of the equivalent type of clone in quail 
trunk neural crest (40-60%; Sieber-Blum and Cohen, 1980, Dev. Biol. 80, 96-106). 
It therefore appears that the segregation pattern to the melanogenic lineage 
during mouse neural crest development in vitro differs quantitatively from that 
in the quail. (2) ""Mixed clones"" consisted of pigmented and unpigmented cells. 
Like pigmented clones, they were observed only in the presence of TPA and CT. 
The clones contained up to four types of cells: melanocytes, S100-positive cells 
(Schwann cells or melanogenic precursor cells), serotonin (5-HT)-positive 
autonomic neuron-like cells, and substance P (SP)-immunoreactive sensory 
neuron-like cells. Thus, at least some mixed clone-forming cells are 
pluripotent. (3) Two classes of ""unpigmented clones"" were observed that 
consisted of unpigmented cells only. These clones developed in the presence and 
absence of TPA and CT. Unpigmented clones in one class contained up to three 
types of cells as well as other, as yet unidentified cells: S100-, 5-HT-, and 
SP-positive cells. This observation suggests that at least some of these clones 
originate from cells with a partially restricted developmental potential. Clones 
in another class consisted of S100- or SP-positive cells only. These clones 
might be derived from cells restricted to the SP-positive neuronal cell or 
melanocyte/Schwann cell lineage. The present data indicate that at initiation of 
migration, the mouse neural crest of the trunk region is a heterogeneous 
population of cells containing pluripotent cells, cells with a restricted 
developmental potential, and cells apparently committed to the melanogenic cell 
lineage."
7686463,"Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live vaccine preparation containing 
attenuated strains of all 3 viruses. MMR vaccine is widely used throughout the 
world, with the US having the widest experience with the vaccine. In countries 
where the vaccine has been introduced successfully, significant reductions in 
all 3 diseases for which it is protective have occurred. The vaccine has been 
shown to be highly immunogenic, with seroconversion rates of 95 to 100% being 
achieved for each of the 3 component vaccines. This immunity appears to be 
long-lasting and may even be lifelong. Minor adverse effects may occur 
approximately 1 week after immunisation. Rarely, mumps vaccine-induced 
meningitis (milder than that associated with wild mumps virus) may occur, its 
frequency varying with the strain of attenuated mumps virus contained in any 
particular vaccine. Clinically, the vaccine is indicated for infants aged 
between 12 and 15 months, and should be administered by intramuscular or deep 
subcutaneous injection. A few specific contraindications exist, including a 
genuine hypersensitivity to eggs, and to the aminoglycoside antibiotics 
kanamycin and neomycin. An increasing number of countries are now adopting a 
2-stage MMR policy in an attempt to prevent epidemics among those who remain 
unprotected, and to move towards eventual disease eradication."
7687205,"We have assessed the feasibility of using fixed-limit criteria based on medical 
relevance and biological variation for evaluating the analytical performance of 
the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. The estimated within-subject variation 
of serum PSA is on the order of 10-20% at clinical decision points. The 
calculated performance goals of 5-10% CV are attainable with current immunoassay 
technology and agree with precision goals based on clinical experience and the 
current clinical use of the test. However, new clinical applications of PSA may 
require a degree of analytical performance that current methods may not be able 
to provide. The PSA model demonstrates the need for biologically based 
fixed-limit criteria for all tumor-marker tests."
7688977,"The objective of this study was to evaluate economically a screening programme 
within the Oxford Regional Health Authority for Down's syndrome, based on 
maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol and human chorionic 
gonadotrophin as well as maternal age (the triple test) against maternal age 
alone. The design of the study involved cost-effectiveness analysis of the 
triple test relative to the maternal age screening programme, and the main 
outcome measure was the cost per Down's birth avoided. It was found that the 
triple test is more cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions concerning 
detection rates and procedure costs. Indirect costs are important in considering 
the cost-effectiveness of the screening programmes. The most efficient detection 
rate is around 58 per cent for which the cost per Down's birth avoided is 
approximately 29,600 pounds if only direct costs are evaluated, 20,100 pounds if 
all NHS costs are considered and -49,800 pounds if all resource consequences are 
analysed. It may be concluded that screening for Down's syndrome using the 
triple test is cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions concerning 
detection rate and procedure costs. If all resource costs are considered, the 
programme is highly cost-effective in comparison with other health care 
interventions."
7690229,"The in vivo rate of brain tryptophan hydroxylation was determined through 
5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation (5-HTPacc) following the administration of NSD 
1015, a L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor. This measurement was 
performed every 4 h throughout a 24 h hour period in 10 discrete brain areas of 
rats maintained on a regular 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle. The concentrations of 
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were also 
determined in untreated rats. Daily variations in 5-HTPacc were found in all the 
areas studied, the 5-HTPacc being higher during the dark period in most 
structures. These results strongly suggest that tryptophan hydroxylation is 
involved in the control of the 5-HT biosynthesis circadian rhythm. However, 
various patterns of 5-HT and 5-HIAA daily variations were observed, suggesting 
that the circadian factors affecting serotonin metabolism can be different among 
brain areas."
7690557,"A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) inhibitor, 
KN-93 potently inhibits gastric acid secretion from parietal cells. As 
previously reported (1), treatment of parietal cells with a selective inhibitor 
of CaM kinase II, KN-62 resulted in the inhibition of cholinergic-stimulated 
rabbit parietal cell secretion, whereas it failed to inhibit the histamine and 
forskolin response. In contrast effects of carbachol, histamine and forskolin 
were significantly inhibited by KN-93 with an IC50 of 0.15, 0.3 and 1 microM, 
respectively; these effects occurred without any changes in intracellular cyclic 
AMP and Ca2+ levels. In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which 
KN-93 acts upon the acid-secreting machinery of gastric parietal cells. Neither 
redistribution of the proton pump activity nor the morphological transformation 
were affected by KN-93. The drug only weakly inhibited the H+, K(+)-ATPase 
activity but strongly dissipated the proton gradient formed in the gastric 
membrane vesicles and reduced the volume of luminal space. Thus KN-93 acts at pH 
gradient formation whereas KN-62 acts only at CaM Kinase II."
7692885,"Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an 
inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of 
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 
accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of 
tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. NSD-1015 increased the 
concentration of L-DOPA much higher than that of 5-HTP in a dose-related manner 
(1-100 mumol/L). In order to examine the relationship between dopaminergic and 
serotonergic neurons in the striatum, either 5-HTP or L-DOPA was injected 
intraperitoneally to rats pretreated with benserazide, an inhibitor of 
peripheral decarboxylase. 5-HTP administration increased 5-HTP, but decreased 
L-DOPA in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, 5-HTP concentration decreased in 
an association with the increased content of L-DOPA following L-DOPA 
administration. The decrease of 5-HTP caused by L-DOPA administration was not as 
remarkable as that of L-DOPA by 5-HTP injection. These results suggest that 
L-DOPA and 5-HTP, the precursor amino acids for catecholamines and indoleamines, 
could affect mutually each other neuronal activity through the inhibition of 
their rate-limiting enzymes."
7693420,"Anthracyclines are among the most active drugs for the treatment of advanced 
breast cancer. Epirubicin has been found to be as effective as doxorubicin at 
equimolar doses but significantly better tolerated, especially in terms of 
alopecia, leucopenia, and cardiac toxicity. The role of anthracycline-containing 
regimens in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer has been studied by only a few 
clinical trial teams. In 1986, the French Adjuvant Study Group (FASG) began a 
randomised trial aimed to investigate the concept of dose intensity as well as 
the optimal duration of treatment in patients with early breast cancer. Between 
1986 and 1990, 621 patients were included in the trial, of whom 595 were 
evaluable. Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 
207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus 
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) 
received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 
(fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) 
every 21 days for 3 cycles. Locoregional radiotherapy was administered after the 
third cycle of chemotherapy in all treatment arms. Clinical prognostic factors 
were similar between treatment groups. Approximately 62% of all patients had 1

7734328,"John Hunter's A Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation and Gunshot Wounds was 
published in 1794. Throughout the nineteenth century this was considered the 
most important study of inflammation and has been widely quoted since. After a 
section on the nature of blood and the circulatory system, in which he describes 
the vascular supply in detail, he passes on to an extensive survey of 
inflammation. This is based mainly on his wide clinical experience, including 
that as a military surgeon. He, however, supplements this with a number of 
experiments, some of which are classic. He bases his observations on the four 
cardinal signs of Celsus (redness, heat, swelling and pain). Inflammation is 
then divided into three main groups: adhesive, suppurative and ulcerative. He 
discusses the nature of pus and the formation and treatment of abscesses. He 
describes his experiments on the transplantation of tissues under the general 
heading of adhesive inflammation. This, he states, underlies the union of wounds 
and thus the union of tissues after transplantation. Although unaware of the 
role of infecting organisms as a cause of inflammation, he makes observations on 
inflammation in smallpox, venereal infections and tuberculosis. He relates these 
to his observations on inflammatory aspects of wound healing. Lister was 
particularly influenced by Hunter's observations in the development of 
antisepsis. As well as the local effect of inflammation, Hunter was concerned 
with the constitutional effects such as fever."
7737124,"The chromatin structure at the Drosophila hsp26 promoter in vivo is 
characterized by two DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites harboring regulatory 
elements. Proximal and distal DH sites are separated by a positioned nucleosome. 
To study the contribution of transcription factors to the establishment of this 
specific chromatin configuration we assembled nucleosomes on the hsp26 promoter 
using a cell-free reconstitution system derived from fly embryos. Both DH sites 
were readily reconstituted from extract components. They were separated by a 
nucleosome which was less strictly positioned than its in vivo counterpart. The 
interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in 
chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the 
nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors 
interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome 
rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions. While chromatin 
remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted 
to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome 
sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization."
7737328,"In vivo brain microdialysis was used to assess the effects of tolcapone, a novel 
central and peripheral inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase on striatal 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-dopa) and dopamine metabolism. The oral 
administration of 30 mg/kg of tolcapone failed to change dopamine output but 
elicited a marked and long-lasting decrease of the extracellular levels of 
homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxytyramine with a concomitant increase of 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). The administration of L-dopa (20 and 60 
mg/kg p.o.) + benserazide (15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in dose-dependent increase of 
dialysate levels of L-dopa and 3-O-methyl-DOPA. Tolcapone (30 mg/kg p.o.), given 
as adjunct to both doses of L-dopa, markedly enhanced the elevation or 
extracellular L-dopa, while it completely prevented the formation of 
3-O-methyl-DOPA. In another experiment, the administration of L-dopa + 
benserazide (30 + 15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in increased extracellular levels of 
dopamine, DOPAC, HVA and 3-methoxytyramine. The co-administration of tolcapone 
(30 mg/kg p.o.) further increased dopamine and DOPAC levels, whereas HVA and 
3-methoxytyramine effluxes were reduced. These findings support the notion that 
tolcapone has the ability to enhance striatal dopamine neurotransmission by 
increasing L-dopa bioavailability through peripheral and central inhibition of 
L-dopa O-methylation, as well as by blocking the central conversion of dopamine 
into 3-methoxytyramine."
7737527,"Up to one-third of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease may show 
improvement in cognitive function with tacrine, a centrally-acting, 
noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Candidates for tacrine must 
have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's dementia based on NINCDS-ADRDA or 
DSM-IV criteria and should have no history of liver disease. For patients 
receiving the drug, do follow-up cognitive testing with a sensitive measure such 
as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale. The most common adverse effects 
associated with tacrine therapy are elevated liver transaminases and 
gastrointestinal effects. Weekly blood tests are necessary to monitor liver 
function. A reliable caregiver is essential to ensure compliance with frequent 
dosing and weekly blood testing."
7738205,"Obesity is frequently associated with insulin resistance and abnormal glucose 
homeostasis. Recent studies in animal models have indicated that TNF-alpha plays 
an important role in mediating the insulin resistance of obesity through its 
overexpression in fat tissue. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to insulin 
resistance and diabetes in humans remain largely unknown. In this study we 
examined the expression pattern of TNF-alpha mRNA in adipose tissues from 18 
control and 19 obese premenopausal women by Northern blot analysis. TNF-alpha 
protein concentrations in plasma and in conditioned medium of explanted adipose 
tissue were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, the effects of weight reduction by 
dietary treatment of obesity on the adipose expression of TNF-alpha mRNA were 
also analyzed in nine premenopausal obese women, before and after a controlled 
weight-reduction program. These studies demonstrated that obese individuals 
express 2.5-fold more TNF-alpha mRNA in fat tissue relative to the lean controls 
(P < 0.001). Similar increases were also observed in adipose production of 
TNF-alpha protein but circulating TNF-alpha levels were extremely low or 
undetectable. A strong positive correlation was observed between TNF-alpha mRNA 
expression levels in fat tissue and the level of hyperinsulinemia (P < 0.001), 
an indirect measure of insulin resistance. Finally, body weight reduction in 
obese subjects which resulted in improved insulin sensitivity was also 
associated with a decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA expression (45%, P < 0.001) in fat 
tissue. These results suggest a role for the abnormal regulation of this 
cytokine in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance."
7738211,"In the treatment of hypertension in renally impaired patients, normalization of 
blood pressure alone may not be sufficient to prevent significant morbidity to 
the kidneys. Treatment must reduce pressure in the renal vasculature, otherwise 
glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate. 
Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a 
suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration 
rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular 
resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained 
natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of 
progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease 
proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the 
efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers, 
isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with 
any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage 
adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal 
insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has 
several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where 
an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, 
dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are 
usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner."
7739505,"Two questions were posed at the beginning of this article. Is EAE a good model 
for MS? And, is MS an autoimmune disease? The first question is easier to 
address than the second. EAE is the best available model for the inflammatory 
processes that occur in MS, and for the disease process. The latter depends 
somewhat on study of chronic relapsing EAE, rather than early or mono-episodic 
EAE, which, although of great immunological interest, is of less relevance to 
the established disease that presents as MS. The second question asks whether MS 
fulfills Koch's postulates as an autoimmune disease. MS has all the hallmarks of 
an inflammatory disease of the CNS. The question then is whether the 
inflammation is autoimmune. The evidence presented shows a considerable 
autoimmune component to MS inflammation, raising the subsidiary question of 
whether autoimmune reactivity induces MS. This remains unanswerable for the 
present, and it should be kept in mind that the same question also would be 
unanswerable by observation of EAE. The major postulate therefore remains 
unfulfilled. Diagnosis of MS as an autoimmune disease requires definitive 
identification of the autoantigen; otherwise, the possibility remains open that 
this is a disease resulting from the inadvertent activation and dysregulation of 
immune processes in the CNS that, themselves, are not directed at that organ."
7739614,"8-Oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate) is a potent mutagenic 
substrate for DNA synthesis. The accumulation of 8-oxo-dGTP in the nucleotide 
pool induces G:C-->T:A transversion as well as A:T-->C:G transversion, and 
Escherichia coli cells possess mechanisms for preventing such mutations. The 
mutT gene product specifically hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to the monophosphate form 
while the mutM and the mutY gene products function to correct mispairs caused by 
incorporation of 8-oxoguanine into DNA. From analyses of forward mutations 
induced in cells lacking 8-oxo-dGTPase (MutT protein) and/or repair enzymes that 
suppress mutations caused by 8-oxoguanine in DNA (MutM and MutY proteins), 
cooperative functions of these proteins in control of the spontaneous 
mutagenesis became evident. In mutator strains lacking MutT and/or MutM 
proteins, 8-oxoguanine of DNA increased to a concentration expected from the 
increased rate of mutation."
7739631,"Extrapolating the figures from a previous study on FSHD in a province of The 
Netherlands to the entire Dutch population suggests that at present a nearly 
complete overview is obtained of all symptomatic kindred. In 139 families, 
dominant inheritance was observed in 97, a pattern compatible with germline 
mosaicism in 6, while sporadic cases were found in 36 families. A mutation 
frequency of 9.6% was calculated. Mental retardation and severe retinal 
vasculopathy were reported in low frequencies (1%). Early onset was seen more 
frequently in sporadic cases. Chromosome 4 linkage appeared excluded in 3 of 22 
autosomal-dominant families. The clinical pictures in the linked and nonlinked 
families were identical."
7747427,"Nucleotides within the pathogenicity domain of potato spindle tuber viroid 
(PSTVd) are known to play an important role in regulating symptom expression, 
but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In order to determine more 
precisely how structural features within the pathogenicity domain regulate 
symptom expression, we have characterized a series of mutations that 
progressively stabilize premelting region 1 and the rest of the ""virulence 
modulating"" region. The structural effects of these mutations were monitored by 
temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of circularized RNA transcripts, and 
their biological effects were assessed by quantitative bioassays in tomato. 
Closure of a 4-nucleotide loop within the premelting region 1 virtually 
abolished PSTVd infectivity, especially when a nearby 2-nucleotide loop was also 
closed. Although RNA transcripts containing less stabilizing mutations were 
readily infectious, none of the four single and one double substitutions 
examined were stably maintained in vivo. The pattern of spontaneous, apparently 
compensatory sequence changes observed in the progeny suggests that PSTVd 
variants with less stable secondary structures enjoy a selective advantage. 
Mutations which stabilize the pathogenicity domain of PSTVd in vitro also 
suppressed symptom expression, but at least one other mutation having no obvious 
structural effects was associated with a similar phenotype. Conformational 
stability appears to be only one of several factors regulating PSTVd replication 
and pathogenicity."
7748943,"The prokaryotic protein HU functions as an accessory factor in many different 
biochemical reactions. We have characterized the role of HU in assembling the 
invertasome, an intermediate nucleoprotein complex involved in Hin-mediated 
site-specific recombination. Formation of this complex requires the looping of 
intervening DNA segments between sites bound by the Hin recombinase and the Fis 
protein. HU stimulates this process on substrates containing intervening 
segments of length < 100 bp. Characterization of the activity of HU in 
Hin-mediated recombination in vitro and in vivo yields evidence that its role in 
this reaction is primarily to facilitate the looping of the intervening DNA 
segment. By using this reaction as an assay, we identify proteins from mammals, 
yeast, trypanosomes, and wheat which can fulfill the same function in vitro. 
Using ligase-mediated circularization of short DNA fragments we also show that 
HU, the high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins from mammals, and a protein 
from yeast can bend DNA extremely efficiently. These results support the view 
that this ubiquitous class of proteins enhance the assembly of nucleoprotein 
complexes under conditions of limited DNA flexibility."
7752802,"82 consecutive outpatients with Crohn's disease (n = 52) and ulcerative colitis 
(n = 30) were examined ambulatory. Rheumatic complaints, objective results and 
diagnosis were correlated to the activity of the underlying illness and the 
extent of the bowel affected. 61% of the examined patients complaint about 
rheumatic pains. In two thirds this could be attributed to noninflammatory 
causes (30% insertion tendinitis. 16% degenerative arthritis, 16% wrong 
carriage), which appeared to be independent of the activity and severity of the 
underlying disease. One fourth of the rheumatic complaints was caused by 
inflammation (21% arthritis, 5% sacroileitis). In these cases a dependency on 
the disease activity and the extent of the colon involvement could be found. No 
cause was found for 12% of the rheumatic complaints. In patients with ulcerative 
colitis suffering from arthritis a significant increase of disease activity 
(Rachmilewitz index) could be shown as compared to ulcerative colitis patients 
without arthritis (p < 0.02). For patients with Crohn's disease no significant 
correlation between arthritis and disease activity could be established. In 
these cases the occurrence of arthritis was associated with the colon 
involvement (Chi2 = 8.48). The data indicate the high frequency of rheumatic 
complaints in inflammatory bowel diseases due to noninflammatory causes."
7754892,"OBJECTIVE: Adhesive capsulitis is a clinical syndrome of pain and severely 
decreased joint motion (""frozen shoulder"") caused by thickening and contraction 
of the joint capsule and synovium. Although arthrographic criteria for the 
diagnosis have been described, to our knowledge, the MR characteristics have not 
been reported. Accordingly, we studied the MR findings in 10 patients with this 
syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images of 25 subjects were included in the study. Nine 
had adhesive capsulitis documented by arthrography, and one had adhesive 
capsulitis proved at surgery. The MR findings in these patients were compared 
with those of 15 asymptomatic volunteers. Images were assessed for thickness of 
the joint capsule and synovium, for thickness of the coracohumeral ligament, and 
for volume of articular fluid. Capsule and synovium thickness was measured 
adjacent to the axillary recess. The volume of intraarticular fluid was 
calculated from direct measurements of the axillary recess and biceps tendon 
sheath. The rotator cuff interval was qualitatively evaluated for the presence 
of abnormal tissue.
RESULTS: Thickening of capsule and synovium on MR images was characteristic of 
adhesive capsulitis, with a significant difference between mean thickness in 
patients with adhesive capsulitis (5.2 mm) and in asymptomatic volunteers (2.9 
mm) (p < .01). Capsule and synovium thickness greater than 4 mm was a specific 
(95%) and sensitive (70%) criterion for the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. 
There was no significant difference in volume of articular fluid or thickness of 
the coracohumeral ligament between patients with adhesive capsulitis and 
asymptomatic volunteers (p > .5). The rotator cuff interval was not useful for 
assessing changes of adhesive capsulitis.
CONCLUSION: Joint capsule and synovium thickness greater than 4 mm is a useful 
MR criterion for the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. The volume of articular 
fluid seen on MR images is not significantly diminished in patients with 
adhesive capsulitis."
7756242,"The association of congenital anal stenosis, scimitar-shaped sacral defect and a 
presacral mass is known as the Currarino triad. These patients present with 
constipation of variable severity which may result from a combination of 
compression by the mass, neurogenic dysfunction as well as anal stenosis itself. 
We have treated three patients who illustrate the spectrum of severity of this 
condition. All had an associated tethered cord. One was cured by a single anal 
dilatation, cord release and anterior meningocele repair. The second did not 
improve after anoplasty and neurosurgical intervention. A previously diagnosed 
rectal ectasia was felt to be contributory to the constipation and was treated 
by low anterior resection with excellent results. The third patient developed an 
ischiorectal abscess that required drainage and colostomy after unsuccessful 
dilatation of a very tight and deeply scarred anal stenosis. A subsequent 
tethered cord release and closure of the anterior meningocele was followed by an 
anoplasty. Colostomy was closed at a later date. In all patients with anal 
stenosis a search should be made for a presacral mass and its associated sacral 
defect. Release of the tethered cord, resection of the presacral mass and/or 
closure of the anterior meningocele are essential for optimal functional 
results."
7756302,"We have used a linear DNA template (239 bp) containing a nucleosome positioning 
sequence (NX1) downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter to study the 
mechanism of transcription elongation through a nucleosome. Under ionic strength 
approaching physiological conditions we have observed that transcription causes 
nucleosome dissociation and histone redistribution within the template. We have 
examined the role of the different elements that, in principle, could induce 
nucleosome dissociation during transcription. The high affinity of histones for 
single-stranded DNA observed in titration experiments performed using the 
purified (+) and (-) strands of the NX1 fragment suggests that nucleosome 
dissociation is not due to the formation of segments of single-stranded DNA by 
RNA polymerase in the elongation process. Furthermore, our results show that 
although RNA can interact with core histones, the synthesized RNA is not bound 
to the histones dissociated by transcription. Our results indicate that core 
histones released during transcription can be bound to naked DNA and chromatin 
(with or without histones H1-H5). From the dynamic properties of excess histones 
bound to chromatin, we suggest a nucleosome transcription mechanism in which 
displaced histones are transiently bound to chromatin and finally are 
reassembled with DNA after the passage of the polymerase."
7757083,"Cri-du-chat is a well described partial aneusomy resulting from deletion of the 
short arm of chromosome 5. The hallmark clinical feature of cri-du-chat, a 
high-pitched monochromatic cry, has recently been localized to 5p15.3, separate 
from the remaining clinical features of the syndrome, which have been localized 
to 5p15.2. Five chromosome 5-specific probes from the latter region, designated 
the cri-du-chat critical region (CDCCR), were used to isolate 30 cosmids from 
the LANL chromosome 5 specific cosmid library. The 30 framework cosmids were 
used in a direct selection with three cDNA sources to isolate an initial set of 
expressed sequences. Nine unique cDNAs were found that hybridized to four 
discrete sets of cosmids in the CDCCR. The nine cDNAs are novel by sequence 
database comparisons, and conservatively represent four transcription units. 
More recently, we have also constructed a YAC contig of the CDCCR which spans 
approximately 2 Mb. As expected, ESTs derived from the nine novel cDNAs map back 
to the contig. Limited expression profiles of these cDNAs have been obtained. 
Two cDNAs that map to one discrete set of cosmids have different expression 
patterns, suggesting that they represent two different genes and increasing the 
number of putative genes to five. Further characterization of these genes and 
the estimated 100 additional genes deleted in cri-du-chat should lead to better 
diagnostic markers and an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the 
disease."
7761171,"A growing skull fracture or leptomeningeal cyst most commonly occurs in children 
under the age of 3 years, and is extremely rare in adults. The reason for a 
growing skull fracture is usually a dural tear in association with the fracture. 
This paper presents an 18-year-old mentally retarded patient with cerebral 
hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome) associated with a growing skull 
fracture in the ipsilateral hemicranium, in whom not only a dural tear but also 
the ipsilaterally displaced and dilated lateral ventricle due to the original 
disease apparently contributed to the development of growing skull fracture."
7762563,"The cri-du-chat syndrome is a contiguous gene syndrome that results from a 
deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p). Patients present with a cat-like 
cry at birth, which is usually considered diagnostic of this syndrome. 
Additional features of the syndrome include failure to thrive, microcephaly, 
hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, hypotonia, and severe mental retardation. We 
report on four families in which patients with 5p deletions have only the 
characteristic cat-like cry, with normal to mildly delayed development. The 
precise locations of the deletions in each family were determined by FISH using 
lambda phage and cosmid clones. All of the deletion breakpoints map distal to a 
chromosomal region that is implicated with the facial features and severe mental 
and developmental delay in the cri-du-chat syndrome. DNA clones mapping in the 
chromosomal region associated with the cat-like cry feature will be useful 
diagnostic tools. They will allow for the distinction between 5p deletions that 
will result in the severe delay observed in most cri-du-chat syndrome patients 
and those deletions that result in the isolated cat-like cry feature, which is 
associated with a better prognosis."
7763274,"We previously described a modification of the whole genome PCR method which 
allowed us to characterize several genes whose expression is regulated by 
thyroid hormone in the mouse liver. Following this procedure, we now report the 
identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as 
target of thyroid hormone. ND3 gene expression is regulated by thyroid hormone 
in rat brain and heart. Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific 
binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene. Hypothyroidism decreases ND3 mRNA 
levels in several brain areas such as cortex and hippocampus during the early 
postnatal development. In line with the recent findings showing the presence of 
TR/c-erbA alpha and beta proteins inside the mitochondria, our results suggest 
the possibility of direct transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial genes by 
thyroid hormone."
7766139,"A high-density growth approach was utilized to produce mutated diphtheria toxin 
from two strains of Corynebacterium diphtheria: C7 (beta)(tox-201,tox-9) and C7 
(beta)(tox-107). The cross-reacting mutants (CRM) of the diphtheria toxin are 
CRM9 and CRM107; both of them carry the mutation in their binding site and, as a 
result, have 1/300 of the systemic toxicity of the wild-type diphtheria toxin. 
Since iron inhibits diphtheria toxin production, the traditional approach has 
been to grow the bacteria in a very low iron concentration. The procedure 
described here involved the use of a modified, non-deferrated, growth medium 
that provided fast and high-density growth of the bacteria, and which, when 
associated with simultaneous depletion of glucose and iron, enhanced the toxin 
production. Oxygen-enriched air was supplied to enable the bacteria to grow to a 
cell density giving an absorbance of 70 at 600 nm (15-20 g/l dry weight). The 
maximum toxin concentration in the culture supernatant was 150 mg/l. The CRM 
products, which remained stable following microfiltration and ultrafiltration, 
could be easily purified using a two-step chromatography procedure."
7768329,"In the present study the hypothesis was tested that 
N-bromoacetyl-3,3',5-[125I]triiodothyronine (BrAc[125I]T3) is a useful affinity 
label for both type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinases (ID-I and ID-III). 
Therefore, the microsomal fractions of various rat tissues were tested for ID-I 
and ID-III activities, and microsomal proteins were labeled with BrAc[125I]T3 
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In agreement with previous observations, high ID-I 
activities were found in liver, kidney and thyroid, and high ID-III activities 
in brain, in particular fetal brain, and placenta. SDS-PAGE of 
BrAc[125I]T3-labeled microsomes showed a prominent radioactive approximately 27 
kDa protein (p27) in liver, kidney and thyroid, which was previously identified 
as ID-I, and a approximately 32 kDa protein (p32) in brain, in particular fetal 
brain, and placenta. A good correlation was found between the affinity labeling 
of p32 and the inactivation of ID-III by BrAcT3, suggesting that p32 represents 
ID-III or a subunit thereof. After treatment of microsomes with 0.05% 
deoxycholate or carbonate buffer (pH 11.5) p32 was still labeled by 
BrAc[125I]T3, indicating that p32 is a transmembrane protein. Although 
3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) is not a substrate for ID-III, p32 was readily 
labeled with BrAc[125I]rT3. Labeling of p32 in rat brain microsomes by 
BrAc[125I]rT3 was not affected by addition of 100 microM unlabeled thyroxine 
(T4) or T3, whereas deiodination of [125I]T3 by ID-III was inhibited by 91 and 
96% in the presence of 1 microM T4 and T3, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

7771476,"Bartter's syndrome is a congenital abnormality characterized by metabolic 
alkalosis [corrected], hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism, and hypokalemia. Most 
patients present early in life with symptoms such as muscle weakness and 
polyuria, which may be attributed to potassium depletion. Despite the 
hyperaldosteronism, the patients tend to be normotensive, which is at least 
partially explained by vascular hyporesponsiveness to pressor hormones. Numerous 
studies have documented increased renal excretion of prostaglandins. Several 
different patterns of aberrant renal ion transport have been observed in 
patients with the syndrome, suggesting that it actually may represent a family 
of related but distinct tubular disorders. Therapeutic approaches to Bartter's 
syndrome include potassium supplementation, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors 
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents), aldosterone antagonists, and converting 
enzyme inhibitors. During the first two decades following its initial 
description, Bartter's syndrome was the focus of widespread interest, based on 
the likelihood that its investigation might provide insight into the normal 
functioning of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and prostanoid hormone systems. 
During the past decade, however, little additional progress has been made in 
Bartter's syndrome, and its patho-physiology remains poorly understood."

7772748,"F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells were used as a model system to study endoderm 
formation during mammalian embryogenesis. F9 cells treated with retinoic acid 
(RA) or RA plus dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP) were examined for the expression of 
stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3), a cell surface marker of primitive 
and visceral endoderm. SSEA-3 was not detected by indirect immunofluorescence on 
the surface of undifferentiated stem cells; however, a subset of SSEA-3-positive 
cells appeared with time in culture, amounting to 20% of cells 10 days after 
plating. When cultured in the presence of RA, the percentage of SSEA-3-positive 
cells increased to 70% of cells 10 days after plating. In contrast, treatment of 
cells with RA plus cAMP yielded differentiated cells that were SSEA-3-negative. 
These SSEA-3-negative cells exhibited ultrastructural features of parietal yolk 
sac endoderm. In contrast, SSEA-3-positive cells appearing in cultures treated 
with RA alone exhibited ultrastructural features of primitive endoderm on day 3, 
switching to ultrastructural features of parietal endoderm on day 10. Cells with 
hybrid features, resembling both visceral and parietal yolk sac, were also seen. 
We suggest that differentiation of F9 EC cells into parietal yolk sac-like cells 
can occur along two distinct pathways: 1) direct under the combined influence of 
RA and cAMP; and 2) indirect, under the influence of RA alone, in which cells 
first differentiate into primitive endoderm. Parietal yolk sac-like cells 
induced through the latter pathway continue to express SSEA-3, a cell surface 
marker of primitive endoderm that is not normally found on parietal endodermal 
cells in vivo."

7774322,"We investigated the frequency of cardiac arrhythmias in patients suspected of 
having sleep apnea, and related them to the severity of apnea, snoring, and 
nocturnal hypoxemia. We prospectively studied 458 patients who had nocturnal 
polysomnography which included objective measurement of snoring (quantified by 
the number of snores per hour of sleep [snoring index (SI)] and maximum 
nocturnal sound intensity [(dBmax)], as well as examination of the 
electrocardiogram (modified lead 2). We found 58 percent prevalence of 
arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI > 10), vs 
42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p < 0.0001). Patients with 
arrhythmias had more severe apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia, but not snoring, than 
patients without arrhythmias. To examine separately the relationship between the 
prevalence of arrhythmias and snoring, nocturnal oxygenation, and apnea--we 
selected subgroups of patients ""at the opposite ends of the spectrum"" with 
respect to the severity of snoring, hypoxemia, and apnea. We found that 38 
percent of light snorers had arrhythmias vs 39 percent of heavy snorers, 82 
percent of patients with mean nocturnal oxygen saturation < 90 percent had 
arrhythmias vs 40 percent of patients with mean nocturnal oxygen saturation > 90 
percent (chi 2 = 7.4, p = 0.006), and 70 percent of patients with AHI > or = 40 
had arrhythmias vs 42 percent with AHI < or = (chi 2 = 9.2, p = 0.002). We 
conclude that patients with sleep apnea as a group have higher prevalence of 
cardiac arrhythmias than nonapneic patients and that snoring alone, without 
concomitant sleep apnea, is not associated with increased frequency of cardiac 
arrhythmias."
7774596,"Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA 
replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in 
the absence of RNase HI. We found that a combination of an rnhA and a recG 
mutation is lethal to the cell. recG mutations that inactivate the helicase 
activity of RecG protein and inhibit reverse branch migration of Holliday 
junctions impart phenotypes resembling those of rnhA mutants. Thus, recG mutants 
display cSDR activity, and recG polA double mutants are inviable as are rnhA 
polA double mutants. These results suggest that the RecG helicase has a role in 
preventing R-loop formation. A model that R-loops are formed by assimilation of 
RNA transcripts into the duplex DNA is discussed. The model further postulates 
that RecA protein catalyzes this assimilation reaction and that RecG protein 
counteracts RecA in this reaction, resolves R-loops by its helicase activity, or 
does both."
7774871,"The cardiac cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix play an essential role for 
maintaining cellular integrity and function of the myocardium. The network of 
microtubules and intermediate filaments are disrupted by the inflammatory 
reaction which depends on resident cells (myocytes, fibroblasts, endothel cells) 
and on systemic cells (granulocytes, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes). 
Changes in the cardiac cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix may affect 
contractile function, since the cytoskeleton organizes the intra- and 
intercellular architecture. The inflammation in heart disease and the induction 
of fibrosis are mediated by cytokines and growth factors derived from fibroblast 
activation and from the B- and T-cell activity. A possible connecting link for 
the induction of fibrosis is the presentation of the myocardial antigens to the 
immune system and its subsequent cellular and humoral autoreactive response 
(Figure 1). Different autoantibodies to sarcolemmal and myolemmal antigens, to 
laminin, to extracellular matrix proteins, to the collagens and to myofibrils 
were demonstrated both in endomyocardial biopsy and as circulating 
autoantibodies in the peripheral blood. The pathophysiological role of the 
cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix are well defined for beta-tubulin, 
fibronectin, laminin, desmin, vimentin, vinculin and collagen: beta-tubulin is 
increased or altered in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Fibronectin appears in 
irregular forms in DCM as well. Ultrastructural analysis showed an increased 
content of laminin in basement membranes. In addition anti-laminin antibodies 
were found in 73% of patients with myocarditis and in 78% of patients with DCM. 
Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as 
indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients 
with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in 
DCM. The vimentin of the endothelial cells and the vinculin of the sarcolemmal 
membrane and the intercalated discs have been demonstrated to be irregularly 
shaped and increased in content in DCM whereas in myocarditis their appearance 
and content is still unknown. The intracellular content of collagen type 5 is 
increased in DCM and in myocarditis. The presence of autoantibodies to 
components of the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in myocarditis and 
perimyocarditis is well-described. Antibodies to the myolemma and the sarcolemma 
are found in almost all patients with perimyocarditis in the serum or bound in 
the biopsy. Some of them have been known cytolytic in vitro to isolated heart 
cells. In pericarditis a shift to antibodies to the extracellular matrix, 
collagen and intermediate filaments is observed among the circulating 
antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
7774897,"We analyzed 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage and 
compared those findings with those of 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced 
cerebral aneurysm rupture. The incidence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease 
(HCVD) was significantly higher in persons with intracerebral hemorrhage than in 
those with aneurysm rupture. Our findings suggest that HCVD predisposes to 
cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage. We propose that the foregoing 
relationship results from a cocaine induced alteration of cerebral 
autoregulation in the context of increased cerebral blood flow."
7776900,"The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the regular practice 
of mindfulness meditation is associated with increased physiological levels of 
melatonin. Melatonin may be related to a variety of biologic functions important 
in maintaining health and preventing disease, including breast and prostate 
cancer. Previous studies have shown melatonin production is photosensitive and 
we suggest here that it also may be psychosensitive. A cross-sectional study of 
12-hour (20:00-08:00) urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin was conducted from which we 
analyzed data from 8 women who regularly meditate (RM) and 8 women who do not 
meditate (NM). All samples were collected in the homes of study participants. 
Volunteers were recruited to provide 12-hour overnight samples of urine. All 
subjects collected the samples on one night during the same 1-week period. There 
was no explicit intervention. However, all RM were either graduates of, or 
teachers in, the University of Massachusetts Stress Reduction and Relaxation 
Program. The main outcome measure was the total excretion of urinary 
6-sulphatoxymelatonin. Multiple linear regression (Proc GLM in SAS) was 
performed to test the effect of meditation (RM vs NM) on 6-sulphatoxymelatonin. 
The results of the study were that after controlling for the non-significant 
effect of menstrual period interval, we found an effect of meditation group (RM 
vs NM: b = 1.983; F = 6.78; p = 0.02) and age (for each integer year: b = 0.169; 
F = 8.41; p = 0.01). The conclusion is that study results are consistent with 
our hypothesis and indicate that melatonin might be a useful parameter in 
testing similar psycho-social interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7777669,"One of the hallmarks of chronic congestive heart failure is an increase in 
sympathetic tone to the peripheral circulation and to the heart. A correlation 
between plasma norepinephrine and the severity of the heart failure state has 
been demonstrated. One mechanism that has been proposed to account for this 
sympathoexcitation is a depression in the baroreflex and, perhaps, cardiac 
reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. This review summarizes work from 
several laboratories, including our own, that documents a depressed baroreflex 
control of heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity in both animals and humans 
with heart failure. The mechanism of the depressed baroreflex most likely is 
caused by reduced baroreceptor sensitivity as well as enhanced input to the 
central nervous system from cardiac receptors that are chemosensitive. Although 
sympathetic tone and arterial baroreflex sensitivity are altered in heart 
failure, there have been no studies showing a cause-and-effect relationship. 
Increases in plasma norepinephrine are similar in baroreceptor-denervated and 
intact dogs paced into heart failure. This latter observation cells into 
question the traditional concept of baroreceptor-mediated increases in 
sympathetic tone in heart failure."
7781761,"Mouse A-type lamin genes were isolated. Structural analyses revealed that all 
the three known mouse A-type lamins (A, C and C2) were coded in a single genomic 
locus in a 22 kilobase DNA segment. The three lamins were coded in 12, 10 and 10 
exons for A, C and C2, respectively, and shared 8 exons among them. Primer 
extension analyses identified possible transcription start sites for both A/C 
and C2 genes suggesting that the locus is under the control of two separate 
promoters, that is a somatic cell-acting promoter (for A and C) and a 
testis-specific promoter (for C2) which resides in the first intron of the A/C 
gene. Sequence characteristics of the possible promoter regions are discussed. 
Divergence of the two somatic cell-type lamins (A and C) is formally accounted 
for by differential selection of poly(A) sites together with lamin A-specific 
splicing."
7785431,"INTRODUCTION: Autonomic dysfunction (AD) can be a feature of both multiple 
system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), conditions that 
are frequently misdiagnosed in life. Most studies on AD in MSA and IPD are based 
on clinical cases without pathological verification.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed AD in 135 pathologically 
confirmed cases of IPD and in 33 of MSA from the UK PD Society Brain Bank.
RESULTS: MSA started at a younger age than IPD (54.4 +/- 10.7 yrs versus 60.6 
+/- 10.8 yrs), and AD began earlier in the course of the illness All MSA 
patients had some degree of AD in life whereas AD was absent in 24% of IPD 
patients. Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable 
numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains 
than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to 
inspiratory stridor.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the presence of autonomic disturbance 
alone does not distinguish between MSA and IPD in individual cases. However, the 
presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, 
are all individually suggestive of MSA."
7785750,"Only 53%-58% of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAB) following the 
rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage. Morbidity 
and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit 
due to cerebral vasospasm. The following review gives an account of 
pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium 
antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is 
discussed in light of the current literature. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY. In addition to 
other vasoactive substances in the blood, haemoglobin, which is released from 
lysed erythrocytes on the 2nd to 4th day after the haemorrhage, plays an 
important role in inducing vasospasm. An inflammatory angiopathy ensues, with 
complete resolution after 6-12 weeks. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced 
depending on the extent of vasospasm. Irreversible infarction may follow the 
decrease of CBF below a critical value. Severe vasospasm causes autoregulatory 
disturbances and reduced responsiveness of cerebral vessels to CO2. CALCIUM 
ANTAGONISTS. The calcium blocker nimodipine causes dilatation of small pial 
vessels with increased CBF. However, systemic vasodilation with the subsequent 
fall in blood pressure may limit the increase in CBF. Furthermore, it is known 
that nimodipine decreases intracellular calcium concentrations resulting in some 
protection against ischaemic cellular injury. Seven placebo-controlled clinical 
studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe 
neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm. HYPERVOLAEMIC HAEMODILUTION. 
Volume expansion and haemodilution to a hematocrit of 30%-33% is suggested to 
improve cerebral perfusion during vasospasm. The central venous and pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressures should be 10-12 mm Hg and 15-18 mm Hg, respectively. 
But there is no evidence of improved outcome with this measure, and pulmonary 
edema is a frequent side effect. However, impairment of cerebral perfusion and 
increased neurological damage can be demonstrated with hypovolaemia and 
haemoconcentration. INDUCED ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. In the presence of cerebral 
vasospasm and resulting autoregulatory disturbances, cerebral perfusion can be 
increased by raising systemic arterial pressure. This measure, too, fails to 
improve neurological outcome. CONCLUSION. Treatment of cerebral vasospasm 
following a SAB aims to avoid any impairment of cerebral perfusion. Hypovolaemia 
and haemoconcentration have to be corrected. Normoventilation should be 
established to avoid hypocapnic vasoconstriction. Nimodipine should be 
administered continuously after a SAB. In view of the autoregulatory 
disturbances, systemic hypotension with its danger of decreased CBF must be 
prevented. The importance of hypervolaemic haemodilution and/or induced arterial 
hypertension is not clear. Despite therapeutic efforts, the number of patients 
who have survived a SAB without a substantial neurological deficit has not 
increased."
7786016,"Arachaebacteria have been recently placed in evolution as a separate kingdom of 
organisms between procaryotes and eucaryotes. Although these organisms contain 
both glycolipids and glycoproteins, they possess no Golgi. No biosynthetic work 
has been published on the complex carbohydrates of these newly reassigned 
organisms. This report describes preliminary results from one member of this 
kingdom, Haloferax volcanii, which suggest that all glycosylation proceeds 
through lipid intermediates. Evidence for novel glycolipid structure was also 
found during this study. H. volcanii plasma membranes contain all of the enzyme 
activities for synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins and archaeol-based 
glycolipids. For glucose transfer, all reactions apparently proceed through 
glucose-phosphopolyisoprenol using UDP-glucose as primary donor. Incorporation 
of D-[3H]glucose from UDP-D-[3H]glucose into glycoproteins and glycolipids of H. 
volcanii was stimulated by addition of C55-polyisoprenol phosphate, but not by 
C85-105 dolichol phosphate, and was inhibited by amphomycin and two recently 
described sugar nucleotide analogs, PP36 
(5'-[N-(2-decanoylamino-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropyloxy 
carbonyl)glycyl]amino]-5'-deoxyuridine) and PP55 
(5'-O-[[(2-decanoylamino-3-phenylpropyloxycarbonyl) amino]sulfonyl]uridine). All 
three inhibitors are reported to block transfer of sugar from UDP-sugars to 
phosphopolyisoprenols in eucaryotes. However, in H. volcanii these inhibitors 
apparently block transfer of glucose from polyprenyl intermediates to final 
glycoproteins and glycolipid products. The sulfodihexosyl archaeol glycolipid 
fraction was partially characterized by mass spectrometry and was found to 
contain a previously unreported structure with sulfate on the reducing-end 
sugar. Four major glycoproteins 190, 105, 56, and 52 kDa and an archaeol-based 
glycolipid fraction were labeled by amphomycin-sensitive pathways. Photoaffinity 
labeling of H. volcanii homogenate with 5-azido-[32P]UDP-Glc tagged only one 
45-kDa polypeptide which is a probable glucosyl-phosphorylpolyisoprenol 
synthase. The fact that only one polypeptide band was photoaffinity-labeled 
indicated that no other transferase utilized UDP-glucose directly in H. 
volcanii. The salt requirement of the UDP-glucose-dependent pathways suggests 
that cytoplasmic enzymes function in a high salt environment in H. volcanii. The 
archaebacterial plasma membrane thus expresses many functions for glycosylation 
of both glycoproteins and glycolipids, normally found in the endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi of eucaryotes."
7787270,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at increased risk for sudden 
death. Recent studies have improved our ability to risk-stratify such patients 
and have elucidated several potential mechanisms of sudden death and syncope. 
Certain noninvasive tests, such as signal-averaged electrocardiography and 
measurements of cardiac autonomic function and QT/QT dispersion, are often 
abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but are not useful for risk 
stratification. Myocardial ischemia determined by exercise thallium 
scintigraphy, however, identifies young patients with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy who are at high risk for cardiac arrest and syncope. Nonsustained 
ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory Holter monitoring in the absence of 
symptoms of impaired consciousness is associated with a benign prognosis and is 
not predictive of sudden death. Conversely, ventricular tachycardia induced at 
electrophysiologic study identifies adult patients with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy who subsequently experience sudden death. Finally, 
characterization of the natural history of the genetic defects will increasingly 
become an integral part of risk evaluation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
7787373,"This pilot-study should contribute to the question whether Pyrethroid 
intoxication can be distinguished from other diseases by characteristic clinical 
symptoms. The results show that the characteristics of the intoxication do not 
consist in singular symptoms but in combinations and correlations of symptoms, 
i.e. of central-neurological with peripheral- and autonomic-neurological as well 
as with characteristic immunological disturbances. Neurological symptoms consist 
in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple 
sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, 
leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like 
sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia. Non-neurological symptoms include 
immunosuppression with consecutive opportunistic infections, like candida 
albicans, most frequently of the alimentary tract, but also dermal and mucosal 
swellings, lichen-ruber-like efflorescences, loss of hair, conjunctivitis. Other 
symptoms are: hypoglycaemic crises inhibition of fertility, disturbances of 
blood clotting, and most frequently in children, suspected hematopoetic 
disorders."
7788945,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of death in the 
young, particularly in young competitive athletes. Death often occurs suddenly 
in asymptomatic, apparently healthy individuals. Several clinical parameters as 
well as genetic factors have been characterized that can identify those HCM 
patients who are at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). The clinical 
parameters that have some predictive values for SCD in HCM patients are the 
following: a prior history of SCD, a family history of SCD, history of syncope, 
symptomatic ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, inducible ventricular 
tachycardia during electrophysiologic studies, and myocardial ischemia in 
children with HCM. Recent identification of mutations in the beta myosin heavy 
chain gene and genotype-phenotype correlation in HCM patients have shown that 
the beta myosin heavy chain mutations are also prognosticators in HCM families. 
Several mutations such as Arg403Gln and Arg719Gln are associated with a high 
incidence of SCD, while Leu908Val mutation is associated with a benign course 
and a low incidence of SCD in HCM families. Additional genetic factors such as a 
polymorphism in angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene may also contribute to a 
high incidence of SCD in HCM families. Identification and characterization of 
HCM patients at high risk for SCD provide the opportunity to render prophylactic 
therapeutic interventions, such as implantation of defibrillators, in these 
individuals."
7789182,"The human calcitonin receptor (CTR) is a transmembrane peptide with dual action 
as a receptor for the hormone calcitonin and as an extracellular calcium sensor. 
Therefore, CTR dysfunction could lead to disorders of calcium metabolism 
associated with hypercalcemia, such as the Williams syndrome (WS). WS is a 
developmental disorder caused by a deletion at chromosome 7q11.23 that includes 
the elastin locus (ELN). We have mapped the CTR gene (CALCR) to chromosome band 
7q21.3 by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation analysis of 
somatic cell hybrids as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to 
metaphase chromosome spreads. Two-color FISH cohybridizing CTR and ELN probes 
confirmed that CALCR maps telomeric to ELN. Subsequent analysis of chromosome 
spreads from four WS patients revealed deletion of the ELN locus in all of them 
and normal hybridization of CTR probes to both chromosome 7 homologues, 
indicating that CALCR lies outside the deleted region."
7789292,"Since the earlier review in Drugs substantial additional data have accumulated 
regarding the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine in various clinical 
situations, as well as data on its clinical effects in atherosclerosis. Recent 
therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of 
patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as 
a conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated 
dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa, 
metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood 
pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another 
antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to 
monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective 
in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and 
that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and 
hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when 
administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine 
Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of 
isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of 
carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for 
early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased 
significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of 
therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder 
of the 3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along 
with its favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular 
hypertrophy, minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of 
quality of life and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the 
treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension."
7790334,"We experienced a rare case of Marfan's syndrome with annulo-aortic ectasia, 
aortic regurgitation and Prinzmetal's variant angina. In a modified Bentall's 
operation (button technique), perioperative severe coronary artery spasm 
occurred in spite of the preventive use of nitroglycerin infusion, which 
resulted in profound ventricular fibrillation and subsequent chordal rupture of 
the mitral valve with Sellers IV regurgitation. Use of nicardipine contained in 
cardioplegia, continuous infusion of nicardipine and nitroglycerin after aortic 
declamping completely prevented coronary spasm throughout the course of a second 
surgery for mitral valve replacement. It is worthy to report this case because 
of rarities such as Marfan's syndrome accompanied by Prinzmetal's variant 
angina, perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation, and 
perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve and progression of mitral 
valve regurgitation. We also stress the efficacy of a new calcium antagonist, 
nicardipine, to prevent coronary artery spasm during open heart surgery."
7793878,"Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL 
Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo 
against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that 
of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. 
H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. 
Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with 
mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of 
DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and 
D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall 
thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not 
form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall 
biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that 
peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. 
Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the 
culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively 
inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In 
contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the 
tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level 
its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data 
together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel 
target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant 
S. aureus."
7794966,"The properties of the binding of annexin V to variously composed phospholipid 
vesicles have been studied by applying a recently developed EPR method, using an 
annexin V spin label. By this approach, this protein is seen to bind to acidic 
phospholipid-containing vesicles, as reported, thus confirming the reliability 
of the method. In addition, binding of this annexin to cardiolipin-containing 
vesicles has been studied in more depth, and the protein has been shown to have 
a distinct affinity for this phospholipid. As a cardiolipin-rich natural 
membrane system, mitochondrial membranes and mitoplasts from rat liver were 
considered, and a strong binding of AV to these membranes was observed. Having 
compared this binding with that to phospholipid vesicles, cardiolipin-rich 
microdomains in the mitochondrial membranes are proposed as the putative 
mitochondrial binding sites for annexin V."

severe nail dystrophy. Examination of the patient for possible associated 
malignancy disclosed an asymptomatic squamous cell carcinoma at the 
oropharyngeal region. The skin lesions resolved almost completely following 
radiation therapy of the neoplasm, but the onychodystrophy persisted. This case 
report illustrates the importance of early recognition of Bazex syndrome."
7798312,"The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is 
important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane 
proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER 
compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains 
unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 
sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular 
localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different 
tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, 
and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate 
compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse 
hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this 
compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in 
the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but 
significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small 
amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, 
including the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, 
some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular 
stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in 
a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans-TGN side of the Golgi 
stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN 
marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN 
under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, 
the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that 
accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport 
the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL-containing 
proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the 
exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in 
different compartments varies according to physiological conditions."
7799459,"1. Sometimes called ""lazy eye,"" amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not 
develop normal sight during early childhood. Amblyopia is common, affecting 
approximately 2 or 3 out of every 100 people. The best time to correct amblyopia

strabismus (misaligned eyes), unequal focus (refractive error), and cloudiness 
in the normally clear eye tissues. 3. To correct amblyopia, a child must be made 
to use the weak eye. This is usually done by patching or covering the strong 
eye. Amblyopia cannot be cured by treating the cause alone; the weaker eye must 
be made stronger in order to see normally."
7801429,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a well-characterized 
X-linked inherited disorder in humans but has not been reported in horses. We 
describe a persistent hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia due to a severe 
G6PD deficiency in an American Saddlebred colt. Other abnormalities in the 
colt's erythrocytes as compared with those of healthy horses (n = 22-35) 
included increased activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, decreased 
concentrations of reduced glutathione and reduced nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and increased concentration of oxidized NADP. 
Morphologic abnormalities included eccentrocytosis, pyknocytosis, anisocytosis, 
macrocytosis, and increased number of Howell-Jolly bodies. Scanning and 
transmission electron microscopic examinations revealed that eccentrocytes had 
contracted to spherical regions and thin collapsed regions. Eccentrocytes were 
more electron dense than were normal erythrocytes when examined by transmission 
electron microscopy. When exposed to acetylphenylhydrazine, erythrocytes from 
the G6PD-deficient colt produced more and smaller Heinz bodies than did 
erythrocytes from normal horses. Abnormalities in the colt's dam included 
presence of eccentrocytes and pyknocytes; her average erythrocyte G6PD activity 
was slightly below the range of reference values."
7801738,"Use of cocaine in the USA, has reached epidemic proportions since 1983, when

reports our experience with 55 cases of neurovascular events (25 ischemic and 30 
hemorrhagic) related to cocaine use in 54 patients. Only 15 patients had other 
risk factors for stroke. Twenty six patients smoked ""crack"", 10 snorted cocaine 
and 12 injected it intravenously. Strokes occurred within 3 h of cocaine use in 
15 patients with infarcts and 17 with hemorrhages. Ten infarcts occurred after 
an overnight binge. Of the hemorrhage group 9 were subarachnoid, 16 
intracerebral (8 basal ganglia, 7 hemispheric and one brain stem) and 5 
intraventricular. Computerized tomography (CT) showed an aneurysm of the 
anterior communicating artery, as well as one of the vein of Galen. Four 
aneurysms and 3 AVMs were identified on angiography. CT revealed 15 infarcts; it 
was normal in 7 patients with pure motor hemiparesis and in 3 with findings 
consistent with anterior spinal artery infarction. Several mechanisms may be 
responsible for the cerebrovascular complications. A sudden rise in systemic 
arterial pressure may cause hemorrhages, frequently in association with an 
underlying aneurysm or AVM. Vasospasm, arteritis, myocardial infarction with 
cardiac arrhythmias and increased platelet aggregation may provoke infarcts."

discussed, together with the role of Candida glabrata in pathology of this type."
7804605,"High-threshold voltage-sensitive calcium channels of the N-type, L-type, and 
P-type have been distinguished in the mammalian CNS predominantly on the basis 
of their sensitivity to selective antagonists. Matching them with genes 
identified by molecular cloning is an ongoing undertaking. Whereas L-type 
channels are characterized by their sensitivity to dihydropyridines and P-type 
channels by sensitivity to the funnel-web spider toxin AgaIVA, the N-type 
channel has been shown to be recognized by the omega-conopeptides GVIA and 
MVIIA. Recently, two new members of the family of omega-conopeptides--MVIIC from 
the marine snail Conus magus and SVIB from Conus striatus--have been described. 
Binding and electrophysiological data suggest that these two peptides, in 
addition to interacting with N-type calcium channels, interact with a widely 
distributed receptor in neuronal membranes that is distinct from N-type 
channels. In this report we demonstrate through biochemical and pharmacological 
differentiation at individual receptor polypeptide resolution, by affinity 
cross-linking, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography, that SNX-230 (synthetic MVIIC) 
binds with high affinity to a calcium channel alpha 1 subunit distinct from the 
high-affinity alpha 1 target of SNX-111 (synthetic MVIIA). SNX-183 (synthetic 
SVIB) interacts with both alpha 1 subunits with lower affinity. Whereas the 
alpha 1 subunit recognized with high affinity by MVIIA corresponds to the N-type 
channel, the other represents a novel calcium channel distinct from N-, L-, and 
perhaps P-type channels."
7804793,"The neuroendocrine response (NER) is an essential component of the adaptive 
process to trauma, brain injury, and major surgery. While receiving additive 
humoral and neural afferent inputs, the brain nuclei responsible for the NER act 
mainly by efferent pathways to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and 
the sympathoadrenal system, the activations of which induce subsequent 
circulatory and metabolic responses. The NER to brain injury is similar to the 
response observed in patients with extracerebral injury, even if the response 
after brain injury is extremely variable. Generally, there is a biphasic 
pattern, with a sympathoadrenal storm associated with variable and altered 
stimulation of the HPA during the ebb phase. The first phase is followed by a 
decrease in both responses while other endocrine changes develop, involving 
mainly the counter-regulatory, gonadal, and thyroid hormones. The outcome after 
brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, 
particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low 
triiodothyronine syndrome. Alterations of the thyroid hormones are largely 
related to a reduction in peripheral deiodination of thyroxin. Recent research 
shows that increased free-radical production and decreased selenium (an 
antioxidant) serum levels play an important role in thyroid metabolism. Two 
major issues remain unsolved: a) the precise definition of cerebral death, since 
endocrine brain function is not abolished in the state currently defined as 
brain death; and b) the question of whether substitutive hormone therapy should 
be applied in severe brain injury."
7808978,"The acronym DOOR was first used by Cantwell in 1975 to describe a syndrome 
comprising sensorineural deafness, osteodystrophy, onychodystrophy, and mental 
retardation. To date, 16 cases of the syndrome have been documented in the 
literature. We present two sisters who died in early infancy with the clinical 
features of DOOR syndrome, both of whom in addition had cardiac defects and 
urinary tract abnormalities. Both infants had the classical clinical features of 
sensorineural deafness, seizures, hypoplastic nails, finger-like thumbs, and the 
characteristic facies of the syndrome. Autopsy in each case revealed the 
additional findings of a membranous ventricular septal defect and a septum 
secundum atrial septal defect. The first child had left-sided hydronephrosis and 
hydroureter, and the second sibling had bilateral hydronephrosis, hydroureter, 
and dilatation of the bladder. Congenital heart disease and renal abnormalities 
have not to our knowledge been previously described in association with the DOOR 
syndrome."
7809091,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein transforms T cells through 
induced expression of many cellular genes, including those encoding the 
growth-related proteins interleukin 2 and the alpha chain of its receptor. 
Induction of these genes is mediated, at least in part, through Tax-dependent 
posttranslational activation of NF-kappa B, typically heterodimers of p50 
(NF-kappa B1) and p65 (RelA). The preexisting NF-kappa B proteins are retained 
in the cytoplasm of cells by association with inhibitory 
ankyrin-motif-containing I kappa B proteins, primarily I kappa B-alpha but also 
including the precursor proteins p105 (NF-kappa B1) and p100 (NF-kappa B2). Here 
we demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed multimeric cytoplasmic 
complex in which NF-kappa B dimers are associated with the p100 inhibitor in a 
manner dependent on the precursor protein's ankyrin domain. We also demonstrate 
an antagonistic effect of the Tax protein on the cytoplasmic sequestration 
function of p100; this in turn leads to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B 
dimers liberated from multimeric complexes. Tax may exert these effects through 
the physical association with p100. Tax also relieves the p100-mediated 
inhibition of DNA binding by p50-p65 heterodimers in vitro. The results 
demonstrate a mechanism by which Tax may activate NF-kappa B in T cells."
7809131,"Genomic homogeneity is investigated for a broad base of DNA sequences in terms 
of dinucleotide relative abundance distances (abbreviated delta-distances) and 
of oligonucleotide compositional extremes. It is shown that delta-distances 
between different genomic sequences in the same species are low, only about 2 or 
3 times the distance found in random DNA, and are generally smaller than the 
between-species delta-distances. Extremes in short oligonucleotides include 
underrepresentation of TpA and overrepresentation of GpC in most temperate 
bacteriophage sequences; underrepresentation of CTAG in most eubacterial 
genomes; underrepresentation of GATC in most bacteriophage; CpG suppression in 
vertebrates, in all animal mitochondrial genomes, and in many thermophilic 
bacterial sequences; and overrepresentation of GpG/CpC in all animal 
mitochondrial sets and chloroplast genomes. Interpretations center on DNA 
structures (dinucleotide stacking energies, DNA curvature and superhelicity, 
nucleosome organization), context-dependent mutational events, methylation 
effects, and processes of replication and repair."
7810468,"Despite the availability of new broad-spectrum antibiotics, sinusitis 
occasionally causes significant morbidity and mortality. One serious 
complication of paranasal sinusitis is subdural empyema, a fulminating 
intracranial disease that is invariably fatal if not treated. The symptoms of 
subdural empyema may be mild and may be the same as those associated with 
sinusitis, or the infection may result in alteration of the level of 
consciousness and focal neurologic deficits. Rapid recognition and treatment of 
subdural empyema is extremely important. Before magnetic resonance imaging 
became available, computed tomography was used for rapid diagnosis of this 
infection. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, is now becoming the diagnostic 
tool of choice. Neurosurgical intervention and high doses of intravenously 
administered antibiotics are the mainstays of treatment. If treatment is 
initiated as soon as the diagnosis of subdural empyema is made, the patient has 
a good chance of recovering with no, or only slight, neurologic defects."
7812008,"We have previously reported that neutrophilic granulocytes rapidly release part 
of their Fc gamma RIII from the plasma membrane upon in vitro activation, 
probably by proteolytic cleavage. In plasma and other body fluids, released or 
soluble Fc gamma RIII has been found in considerable amounts. In the present 
study, neutrophils were kept in maintenance culture for 18 to 24 hours. Forty 
percent of the neutrophils completely lost Fc gamma RIII, and the remainder of 
the cells showed a 60% decrease in Fc gamma RIII expression on their surface. 
Released Fc gamma RIII was detected in the culture supernatant. Nevertheless, 
more than 90% of the cells was viable as judged by hydrolysis of fluorescein 
diacetate. The presence of interferon gamma, granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but not 
interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, or IL-8, in the culture medium increased the number 
of cells that still expressed Fc gamma RIII. We found that this loss of Fc gamma 
RIII was not the result of cell activation but correlated strongly with 
apoptosis. The Fc gamma RIII-negative subpopulation exhibited typical 
morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. 
Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of 
binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high 
affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by 
cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V 
binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive 
subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an 
convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc 
gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils 
undergoing apoptosis in the tissues."
7815482,"A single-chain antibody fragment that identifies a neutralizing epitope on the 
envelope protein of louping ill and some other tick-borne flaviviruses was 
previously expressed in soluble form from bacteria and shown to be functionally 
active in vitro. To see whether or not the single-chain antibody could bind and 
inactivate infectious virus in vivo, we have used recombinant Sindbis virus as a 
delivery vehicle for intracellular expression of the antibody fragment. The 
variable genes and interchain linker encoding the single-chain antibody were 
cloned into a double subgenomic Sindbis virus expression vector to generate 
recombinant Sindbis virus. Infection with this recombinant Sindbis virus 
provided high-level cytoplasmic expression of the antibody fragment in mammalian 
cells. We demonstrate (i) that the antibody fragment was antigen binding and 
(ii) that louping ill virus infectivity was significantly reduced in the 
presence of intracellular antibody expressed by the superinfecting recombinant 
Sindbis virus."
7819984,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether colour blindness affects batting in professional 
cricketers.
DESIGN: Comparison of batting averages of colour blind cricketers and those with 
normal vision.
SETTING: Players on 18 first class county cricket teams.
SUBJECTS: 280 of 306 players were tested.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of Isihara colour blindness tests.
RESULTS: Batting average for the colour blind group (12 players) was slightly 
lower than for players with normal vision (20.88 v 26.31). There was no 
difference in the number of batsmen and bowlers affected. Batting averages 
before and after the introduction of the white ball into Sunday League cricket 
did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: That batting performance is not significantly impaired by colour 
blindness suggests that to some extent these players are self selected. Routine 
testing of cricketers for colour blindness is not recommended."
7865648,"METHOD: In a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study, pantoprazole 
40 mg or placebo were given orally to 12 male volunteers for 2 weeks each. There 
was a wash-out period of at least 1 week between the two treatment periods. The 
effects of pantoprazole or placebo on cortisol and testosterone (primary 
criteria), and tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, 
thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, 
aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin and 
somatotrophic hormone were compared. In addition, intragastric 24-h pH, 24-h 
H(+)-activity, and volume of nocturnal gastric juice were determined by gastric 
aspiration technique.
RESULTS: Pantoprazole did not influence plasma levels of testosterone, circadian 
cortisol concentrations or plasma cortisol levels after exogenous 
adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, as compared to placebo (P > 0.05, 
Koch's test). Furthermore, there were no clinically relevant changes with any of 
the other endocrine parameters. Pantoprazole significantly increased the median 
24-h pH (group median 4.3 vs. 1.8; P < 0.001) and decreased 24-h H(+)-activity 
(4.0 vs. 22.6 mmol/L; P < 0.001). The volume of nocturnal gastric juice did not 
significantly differ between the two treatments. Pantoprazole was well tolerated 
and the frequency of adverse events was similar to placebo. No drug-related 
changes in laboratory values were observed.
CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole did not influence endocrine function in healthy male 
volunteers during short-term treatment."

7868070,"The phenomenon of parental imprinting has become increasingly important in 
disciplines such as evolution, genetics, molecular biology, embryology and 
pathology. Principally, parental imprinting refers to a parent-of-origin 
dependent expression of a subset of autosomal loci, independent of the sex of 
the offspring. Today, at least seven such loci have been identified, including 
the human IGF2 gene. It appears that the set of imprinted genes is not always 
identical between the species, although the importance of maintaining this kind 
of gene regulation is evolutionarily conserved. It is particularly interesting 
from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the 
Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve 
unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci. We show here that the four 
different human IGF2 promoters are expressed mono- and/or biallelically in 
complex patterns in postnatal liver specimens."
7868848,"In a previous pharmacokinetic study in Alzheimer patients great inter-individual 
variation and low oral bioavailability of the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine 
(tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA) were found. In the present investigation oral and 
rectal administration of tacrine were compared with the aim to find a route for 
improved bioavailability through diminished first-pass metabolism in the liver. 
Eight patients suffering from Alzheimer's dementia were given tacrine by oral 
(25 and 50 mg b.i.d.) and rectal (12.5 and 25 mg b.i.d.) routes for 1 week with 
4-6 weeks washout in between. Drug hydroxylation capacity in the patients was 
determined using the debrisoquine test. Levels of tacrine in plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined and the cognitive performance was 
examined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer Deficit 
Assessment Scale (ADAS). Tacrine was well tolerated in all but one patient, a 
slow hydroxylator, who developed an aplastic anemia. MMSE and ADAS scores did 
not significantly change, except for word recall which was improved on tacrine 
when given by the rectal route. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the two 
administration routes revealed that the drug dose may be reduced by almost 50% 
when given rectally compared to orally. Concentrations of tacrine in the CSF 
were significantly lower and correlated linearly with the concentrations in 
plasma."
7869378,"Heterogeneity of DNA repair has been observed at different levels of genomic 
organization, including chromatin domains, expressed genes and DNA strands. If 
heterogeneity also existed intragenically, it could reveal fine details of the 
excision repair mechanism in vivo. Here we measure the frequency of UV-induced 
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at individual nucleotides within defined portions 
of two Escherichia coli genes, lacl and lacZ, at various times after 
irradiation. Two domains of differential repair rates were apparent, with repair 
being slow at nucleotides adjacent to the transcription start sites. In lacZ, 
the domain of faster repair began 32 bases downstream of the transcription start 
site and required the mfd gene. Since mfd codes for a transcription-repair 
coupling factor, this transcription-coupled repair system evidently becomes 
operative downstream of the initiation complex region in vivo. Unexpectedly, 
however, (1) an mfd mutation reduced repair in the downstream domain even when 
transcription was at a very low level and (2) induction of lacZ transcription 
with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside overcame this reduction. Evidently, the 
Mfd transcription-repair coupling factor is required for basal levels of 
strand-specific repair in this gene, but induced levels of repair are related to 
transcription through another mechanism."
7869998,"BACKGROUND: Hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting in the absence of 
hypertension, moderate metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninism and hyperaldosteronism 
suggest the presence of Bartter's syndrome. The underlying cause is an inherited 
defect of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle. A 
differential diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome is Gitelman's syndrome, another 
hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia syndrome, which is thought to be caused by a 
transport defect in the distal tube.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 3 patients presenting with signs primarily 
suggestive of Bartter's syndrome, who turned out to have Gitelman's syndrome 
after determining the excretion of calcium in the urine.
RESULTS: Two women, 36- and 55-year old, suffered from paresthesias in the hands 
and feet and from tetanic convulsions. The brother of the 36-year old woman 
presented in our hospital because of an accidentally discovered hypokalemia 
without any clinical symptoms. In all patients the outstanding biochemical 
features were hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and moderate metabolic alcalosis. The 
renin and aldosterone values were inappropriately high. The most characteristic 
finding in the urine, besides the presence of hyperkaliuria was the diminution 
of calcium excretion, despite normocalcemia.
CONCLUSION: The association between sodium and calcium reabsorption in the loop 
of Henle predicts hypercalciuria in patients with a defect in salt reabsorption 
in this segment, as in Bartter's syndrome. In Gitelman's syndrome the laboratory 
features resemble the findings in Bartter's syndrome, except for the presence of 
hypocalciuria. Since hypocalciuria follows also the administration of thiazide 
diuretics, which act in the early part of distal tube, a transport defect in 
this part of the tube is thought to be responsible for the electrolyte 
disturbances in Gitelman's syndrome. The measurement of the urinary calcium 
excretion in patients with an unclear hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia-syndrome allows 
easily the differentiation between Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome."
7870075,"Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) are known to cause classical Marfan's

7870637,"The effects of fruit and vegetables in conjunction with low-energy diet as 
adjuncts to a prudent diet were compared for 6 months in a randomized, single 
blind trial in the management of 202 group A and 204 group B patients with acute 
myocardial infarction. Dietary intakes were obtained based on weighing of fruit, 
vegetable and legume intake and weekly diet diaries. After 6 months of 
follow-up, mean body weight, waist/hip ratio and glucose intolerance fell 
significantly in patients in group A compared with those in group B. Body weight 
declined by 5.3 kg in group A versus 2.2 kg in group B (95% confidence interval 
of difference (CI) 1.28-4.92), waist/hip ratio decreased by 0.05 in group A and 
0.02 in group B (95% CI 0.01-0.10), and glucose intolerance decreased by 0.85 
mmol/l in group A versus 0.19 mmol/l in group B (95% CI 0.19-1.21). There was a 
significant net decrease in serum triglycerides (0.18 mmol/l), systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures (7.9/4.7 mmHg), and a net increase in high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (0.10 mmol/l). Underlying these changes, group A 
patients had 393 g/day net increase in the consumption of fruit and vegetables 
and 1,160 kJ/day net decrease in energy intake compared to these changes in 
groups. Those who made greater changes in diet also had greater improvements in 
central obesity, glucose intolerance and in other associated disturbances."
7873471,"To assess the effects of ranolazine, a new antiischemic drug, on regional 
myocardium of the left ventricle, left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic and 
angiographic data were obtained in 15 patients with previous transmural 
myocardial infarction before and after intravenous infusion of ranolazine (200 
or 500 micrograms/kg body weight). LV angiogram was analyzed by the area method 
and was divided into six segments. Regional LV segments were classified as 
normal (perfused by intact coronary vessels, n = 20), ischemic (perfused by 
stenotic vessels but without ECG evidence suggesting myocardial necrosis, n = 
25), or infarcted (total coronary occlusion and with the ECG evidence for 
necrosis, n = 45). Regional area fractional shortening, peak filling rate, and 
segmental wall motion during isovolumic relaxation period were analyzed. After 
ranolazine, regional area fractional shortening was unchanged in all segments. 
However, regional peak filling rate was decreased in the normal segments (1499 
+/- 315 to 1368 +/- 303 mm2/sec, p < 0.05). In the ischemic segments, by 
contrast, the administration of ranolazine significantly increased the regional 
peak filling rate (1050 +/- 410 to 1133 +/- 439 mm/sec, p < 0.05) and regional 
wall lengthening during the isovolumic relaxation period (0.9 +/- 4.1% to 2.8 
+/- 5.7% of end-diastolic segmental area, p < 0.05), which indicates an 
improvement of regional diastolic function. Infarct segments were little 
affected by ranolazine. Thus, ranolazine improves diastolic function of the 
noninfarcted myocardium under chronic ischemic conditions and also may exert a 
mild negative lusitropic effect on the normal myocardium, although the former 
beneficial effect appears to be more clinically important.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

7874122,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with abnormal expansions of the CTG 
repeats in the 3' untranslated region of its gene. Previous studies in 
individuals of European origin demonstrated strong linkage disequilibrium 
between different CTG repeat length alleles and an Alu element 
insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 8 of the DM gene: CTG11-13 chromosomes 
were almost exclusively associated with the deletion allele, while chromosomes 
with five or 19-30 repeats or disease chromosomes were only found on the 
insertion allele. One of the models suggested by these results proposed that the 
triplet repeats on insertion-associated chromosomes were particularly prone to 
mutation. Studies of other triplet repeat disorders have suggested that arrays 
of perfect repeats are more prone to instability than those that are 
interrupted. We have examined the evolution of this locus by typing a variety of 
primates and samples drawn from several different human populations for both CTG 
repeat length and the insertion/deletion polymorphism. DM gene sequences from 
different primates revealed inter- and intraspecies variability in the number of 
CTG repeats. Human chromosomes with five repeats or 11-13 repeats (the two major 
modes of the human CTG repeat distributions) showed no evidence of preferential 
stabilization of these repeat sizes by imperfect sequences. The insertion and 
deletion allele frequencies showed large interpopulation variation and the 
degree of association between these alleles and various CTG repeat lengths is 
not nearly as complete as was previously supposed. We have found deletion 
alleles carrying long normal (> 19) CTG repeats and insertion alleles associated 
with CTG11 - 13 in two african populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7875209,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3, CD50), a member of the immunoglobulin 
gene superfamily, is a major ligand for the lymphocyte function-associated 
antigen 1 (LFA-1, CD18/CD11a) in the resting immune system and plays a role as a 
signaling and costimulatory molecule on T lymphocytes. In this study we have 
generated a large panel of anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and show that 
the biological effects of these antibodies are critically dependent on the 
epitope recognized. By using an adhesion assay employing COS cells expressing 
LFA-1 binding to recombinant chimeric ICAM-3-Fc proteins (which overcomes the 
confounding effects of interleukocyte LFA-1/ICAM binding events), we have been 
able to examine the effects of these antibodies in blocking LFA-1/ICAM-3 
adhesion. Our data suggests that only a small minority of ICAM-3 mAb, 
recognizing a distinct epitope, are able to mimic the effects of LFA-1 binding 
to ICAM-3. Moreover these antibodies are functionally distinct as defined by 
their costimulatory activity and ability to elicit interleukin-2 production and 
cell proliferation in T lymphocytes."
7875314,"In earlier work, we demonstrated that 5'-CG-3' methylation inhibits the 
transcriptional activity of human Alu elements associated with the alpha 
1-globin and the angiogenin genes in a cell-free transcription system from HeLa 
nuclear extracts. These studies have been extended to different Alu sequences 
and to investigations on the mechanism involved in transcriptional silencing by 
methylation. By comparing the results of DNase I and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in 
vitro footprinting on a consensus sequence in the RNA polymerase III promoter 
control B region between the unmethylated and the 5'-CG-3' methylated B box, 
evidence has been adduced for effects of 5'-CG-3' methylation on the interaction 
of specific nuclear proteins with DNA sequences in the B control region of the 
Alu elements. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the 
5'-CG-3' methylation interferes with the binding of proteins that are essential 
for the function of the B control region in these RNA polymerase III-transcribed 
elements, and that promoter methylation thus inhibits transcription."
7875632,"The present paper reviews classification and mode of action of agents that 
suppress extrasystoles and tachyarrhythmias. These are classified according to 
their electrophysiological effects observed in isolated cardiac tissues in vitro 
(Vaughan Williams, 1989). Fast sodium channel blockers (class I) which reduce 
the upstroke velocity of the action potential are usually subclassified into 
three groups, class I A-C, according to their effect on the action potential 
duration. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (class II) exert their effects by 
antagonizing the electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines. 
Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg amiodarone) prolong the action potential and 
slow calcium channel blockers (class IV) suppress the calcium inward current and 
calcium-dependent action potentials. The classification of antiarrhythmic drugs 
is still under debate. This particularly applies to agents of class I and III. 
The effect of class I agents is frequency-dependent because the binding affinity 
of these drugs to the sodium channel is modulated by the state of the channel 
(modulated receptor hypothesis). Class I agents bind to the channel in the 
activated and inactivated state and dissociate from the channel in the rested 
state. This occurs at a drug-specific rate so that class I agents can be 
subclassified into only two groups, namely in those of the slow- and 
fast-recovery type respectively (time constant of reactivation greater or 
smaller than 1 s). Slow-recovery class I agents affect regular action potentials 
at normal heart rates which can more easily lead to a lengthening of the QRS 
duration in the ECG, to conduction disturbances and hence to pro-arrhythmic 
effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7876010,"Traumatic avulsion of the right diaphragm from the lumbocostal arch is a very

a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, 
Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the 
right side, 10 years before. At the time of injury the lesion of the diaphragm 
went unnoticed. The diagnosis was made 10 years later when the patient was 
referred for chronic right thoracic pain combined with postprandial abdominal 
distension and crampy pain in the abdomen. The chest radiogram and CT-scan 
showed displacement of the right kidney and most of the right colon into the 
thorax due to avulsion of the diaphragm from its dorsal insertion on the 
lumbocostal arch. Surgical repair was necessary to obtain relief from pain and 
to prevent intestinal obstruction. Reduction of the hernia, reinsertion of the

7883791,"Distinct point mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are the cause of the 
inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes (MEN 2), and the 
congenital gut disorder Hirschsprung disease. The site and type of these

receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by RET. The normal function of the RET receptor 
tyrosine kinase has yet to be determined. However, this has been investigated by 
the inactivation of the RET gene in transgenic mice. The developmental 
abnormalities apparent in these mice, together with the observation that the 
major tissues affected in MEN 2 and Hirschsprung disease have a common origin in 
the embryonal neural crest, suggest that RET encodes a receptor for a 
developmental regulator involved in the genesis of a variety of neural crest 
derivatives, and in the organogenesis of the kidney."
7884500,"Premature closure of cranial sutures (primary craniosynostosis) in children 
leads to characteristic skull deformities and prevents the constricted brain 
from growing normally. Although the cause remains unknown, several etiological 
factors have been cited. Recently, hypovascularity has been reported as a 
possible cause of craniosynostosis.
METHODS: In a prospective study regional cerebral blood flow studies were 
carried out with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in seven children with craniosynostoses. Five 
preoperative and six postoperative studies were conducted and the results 
correlated with radiological and surgical findings.
RESULTS: Preoperative studies revealed regional hypovascularity in the 
underlying cerebral hemisphere, corresponding to the fused sutures. 
Postoperative studies revealed disappearance of these perfusion defects in most 
cases, indicating normalization of perfusion following surgical decompression.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes the presence of cerebral hypovascularity in 
craniosynostoses and suggests that early surgery and release of craniostenosis 
is essential to achieve optimum perfusion and brain development."
7886000,"Mutations of the tyrosinase gene associated with a partial or complete loss of 
enzymatic activity are responsible for tyrosinase related oculocutaneous 
albinism (OCA1). A large number of mutations have been identified and their

pathogenesis of these different mutations. Missense mutations produce their 
effect on the activity of an enzyme by altering an amino acid at a specific 
site. The location of these mutations in the peptide can be used to indicate 
potential domains important for enzymatic activity. Missense mutations of the 
tyrosinase polypeptide cluster in four regions, suggesting that these are 
important functional domains. Two of the potential domains involve the copper 
binding sites while the others are likely involved in substrate binding. More 
critical analysis of the copper binding domain of tyrosinase can be gained by 
analyzing the structure of hemocyanin, a copper-binding protein with a high 
degree of homology to tyrosinase in the copper binding region. This analysis 
indicates a single catalytic site in tyrosinase for all enzymatic activities."
7886456,"The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastritis, peptic 
ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in 
vivo was studied by adapting fresh clinical isolates of bacteria to colonize the 
stomachs of mice. A gastric pathology resembling human disease was observed in 
infections with cytotoxin-producing strains but not with noncytotoxic strains. 
Oral immunization with purified H. pylori antigens protected mice from bacterial 
infection. This mouse model will allow the development of therapeutic agents and 
vaccines against H. pylori infection in humans."
7889269,"1. (-)-Deprenyl has been shown to potentiate rat striatal neurone responses to 
dopamine agonists at doses not altering dopamine metabolism. Since there are a 
number of effects of (-)-deprenyl which could result in this phenomenon, we have 
investigated the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327, whose only common effect 
with (-)-deprenyl is an inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), on rat 
striatal neurone responses to dopamine and on striatal dopamine metabolism. 2. 
Using in vivo electrophysiology, i.p. injection of either MDL 72,145 or Ro 
19-6327 was found to produce a dose-dependent potentiation of striatal neurone 
responses to dopamine but not gamma-aminobutyric acid. 3. Neurochemical 
investigations revealed that this occurred at doses (0.25-1 mg kg-1) which, 
while not affecting levels of dopamine or its metabolites, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or homovanillic acid, did cause a significant, 
dose-dependent, elevation in striatal levels of the putative neuromodulator, 
2-phenylethylamine (PE). 4. Inhibition of PE synthesis by i.p. injection of the 
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of 
the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327. 5. Neurochemical analysis revealed 
this to occur at a dose of NSD 1015 (10 mg kg-1) selective for reduction of 
elevated PE levels. 6. These results suggest that PE can act as a neuromodulator 
of dopaminergic responses and that MAO-B inhibitors may potentiate neuronal 
responses to dopamine via the indirect mechanism of elevation of PE following 
MAO-B inhibition."
7889444,"OBJECTIVE: To compare clinically relevant pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and 
toxico logical characteristics of calcium-modulating compounds used in ischemic 
heart disease.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1990 pt B to 1991 pt A revised for 1993; 1991 pt 
B to 1992 revised for 1993; and January to May 1993) combining the search 
phrases 'calcium channel blockers', 'myocardial ischemia', 'pharmacodynamics' 
and 'pharmacokinetics', and a search in Compact Cambridge Drug Information 
Source vol-6 (revised 1992, fourth quarter) using the search phrase 'calcium 
antagonists' and medical subject headings (MeSH) 'pharmacokinetics' and 
'pharmacodynamics' were used to obtain title and abstract information on 
available current literature.
STUDY SELECTION: Review articles, proceedings and studies published in English 
and available within the University of Saskatchewan library system, as they 
appeared to relate closely to the objective, were obtained for closer 
evaluation. In addition, primary references were examined, and journal reprints 
were selected from the authors' files.
DATA EXTRACTION: The focus was on studies and objective reviews that profiled 
one or more representative compounds in a manner suitable for deriving 
background and comparative information pertaining to the objective. Data from 
multiple studies, or from studies that employed multiple methodological 
approaches, were preferentially extracted and summarized for presentation.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The role of calcium in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle 
physiology was reviewed, highlighting the major mechanisms responsible for 
maintaining calcium homeostasis in these cells. With a focus on verapamil, 
diltiazem and 1,4-dihydropyridines currently employed in the treatment of 
cardiovascular disorders, a general survey of their sites of action, tissue 
selective pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic properties and side effects was 
undertaken in a comparative context.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcium antagonists are employed in the treatment of angina, 
certain cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. They are a chemically and 
pharmacologically heterogeneous group of compounds that act principally to 
inhibit the influx of calcium across certain voltage-dependent membrane 
channels. Concepts pertaining to calcium mobilization in the pathophysiology of 
myocardial ischemia, particularly at the molecular level, have evolved 
remarkably over the past decade. The repertoire of agents having 
calcium-regulating properties has expanded in parallel. The task of integrating 
new knowledge in both of these areas requires further attention in order to 
determine optimal approaches to treatment."
7891887,"The apolipoprotein E type 4 allele is a susceptibility gene for late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E is found in neurons, some of which contain 
paired helical filaments made of the microtubule-associated protein tau. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that the apoE3 isoform, but not the apoE4 
isoform, binds tau with high avidity. Because the microtubule-associated protein 
MAP2c also effects microtubule assembly and stability, we examined interactions 
between apoE isoforms and MAP2c. Similar to the tau-binding results, apoE3, but 
not apoE4, bound MAP2c. Binding was detectable down to 10(-9) M MAP2c and 10(-8) 
M apoE3. Isoform-specific interactions of apoE with the microtubule-associated 
proteins MAP2c and tau might affect intracellular maintenance of microtubules 
and could contribute to a time-dependent pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
7892602,"The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a 
paired domain and a homeodomain. It is homologous to the mouse Small eye (Pax-6) 
gene and to the Aniridia gene in humans. These genes share extensive sequence 
identity, the position of three intron splice sites is conserved, and these 
genes are expressed similarly in the developing nervous system and in the eye 
during morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in both the insect and in the 
mammalian genes have been shown to lead to a reduction or absence of eye 
structures, which suggests that ey functions in eye morphogenesis. By targeted 
expression of the ey complementary DNA in various imaginal disc primordia of 
Drosophila, ectopic eye structures were induced on the wings, the legs, and on 
the antennae. The ectopic eyes appeared morphologically normal and consisted of 
groups of fully differentiated ommatidia with a complete set of photoreceptor 
cells. These results support the proposition that ey is the master control gene 
for eye morphogenesis. Because homologous genes are present in vertebrates, 
ascidians, insects, cephalopods, and nemerteans, ey may function as a master 
control gene throughout the metazoa."
7893163,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H (PGH) synthases 1 and 2 are both 
membrane-associated proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
nuclear envelope. The carboxyl terminal tetrapeptides of PGH synthases 1 and 2 
are of the form -P/STEL. These sequences are similar to the -KDEL retention 
signal sequence characteristic of many proteins localized to the ER. To 
determine if the -PTEL sequence (residues 597-600) functions as an ER retention 
signal for ovine PGH synthase-1, we prepared and analyzed five mutants (L600N, 
L600R, L600V, E599Q, and delta 597), all having modifications that would be 
expected to alter the subcellular location of PGH synthase-1 if the -PTEL 
sequence were involved in ER targeting. Native ovine PGH synthase-1 and each of 
the five mutants were subcloned into the pSVT7 expression vector and were 
expressed transiently in cos-1 cells. The L600N, L600R, E599Q, and delta 597 
mutants retained both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. Moreover, when 
subjected to immunocytofluorescent staining, cos-1 cells expressing native and 
mutant enzymes showed similar patterns of fluorescence corresponding to ER and 
nuclear envelope localization. Finally, culture media bathing cos-1 cells 
transfected with native or mutant PGH synthases were tested for secreted PGH 
synthase-1 protein by Western blotting, but no PGH synthase-1 was detected in 
any of the culture media. Our results demonstrate that mutations in the 
C-terminal sequence-PTEL do not change the subcellular location of ovine PGH 
synthase-1. Thus, targeting of PGH synthase-1 to the ER can occur independent of 
its -PTEL sequence."
7896290,"Cri-du-chat is a chromosomal deletion syndrome characterized by partial deletion 
of the short arm of chromosome 5. The clinical symptoms include growth and 
mental retardation, microcephaly, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, hypotonia, 
and a high-pitched monochromatic cry that is usually considered diagnostic for 
the syndrome. Recently, a correlation between clinical features and the extent 
of the chromosome 5 deletions has identified two regions of the short arm that 
appear to be critical for the abnormal development manifested in this syndrome. 
Loss of a small region in 5p15.2 correlates with all of the clinical features of 
cri-du-chat with the exception of the cat-like cry, which maps to 5p15.3. Here 
we report the construction of a YAC contig that spans the chromosomal region in 
5p15.2 that plays a major role in the etiology of the cri-du-chat syndrome. YACs 
that span the 2-Mb cri-du-chat critical region have been identified and 
characterized. This YAC contig lays the groundwork for the construction of a 
transcriptional map of this region and the eventual identification of genes 
involved in the clinical features associated with the cri-du-chat syndrome. It 
also provides a new diagnostic tool for cri-du-chat in the shape of a YAC clone 
that may span the entire critical region."
7897414,"Two unrelated and previously healthy girls, aged 17 and 18, presented with a 
subacute encephalopathy, visual and sensory symptoms and signs, and prominent 
seizures that were difficult to control. Brain MRI showed lesions (high signal 
on T2 weighted images) in the occipital lobes and thalamus; EEG showed slow wave 
activity with superimposed polyspikes. Inexorable downhill progression led to 
death in hepatic failure within eight months of onset. Histopathological 
findings in both patients ((a) chronic hepatitis with prominent bile duct 
proliferation, fatty change, and fibrosis; (b) in the brain a patchy destruction 
of the cerebral cortex, predominantly involving striate cortex) were 
characteristic of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver 
disease--Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome--a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
usually seen in infants and young children."
7899177,"This article reviews in detail the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and 
management of impetigo in children. Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin 
infection of children. Most cases of nonbullous impetigo and all cases of 
bullous impetigo are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The remainder of cases of 
nonbullous impetigo are due to group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). 
GABHS colonize the skin directly by binding to sites on fibronectin that are 
exposed by trauma. In contrast, S. aureus colonizes the nasal epithelium first; 
from this reservoir, colonization of the skin occurs. Patients with recurrent 
impetigo should be evaluated for carriage of S. aureus. Superficial, localized 
impetigo may be treated successfully in more than 90% of cases with topical 
application of mupirocin ointment. Impetigo that is widespread or involves 
deeper tissues should be treated with a beta-lactamase-resistant oral 
antibiotic. The choice of antibiotics is affected by the local prevalence of 
resistance to erythromycin among strains of S. aureus, antibiotic cost and 
availability, and issues of compliance."
7900601,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a technique of MR-guided stereotactic 
radio frequency ablation, which was developed as a minimally invasive treatment 
for brain tumors, and to determine MR characteristics and sequential evolution 
of radio frequency lesions created to ablate brain tumors.
METHODS: Fourteen lesions in 12 patients with primary and metastatic brain 
tumors were treated with this technique and followed for up to 10 months. The 
stereotactic coordinates of the tumor and the angle of the radio frequency probe 
were calculated on MR imaging. The radio frequency lesion was generated in the 
awake patient by increasing the temperature to 80 degrees C within the tumor for 
1 minute. This was repeated until the entire tumor volume was destroyed. MR 
imaging was performed before, during, and immediately after the radio frequency 
procedure, and sequential MR was obtained during clinical follow-up.
RESULTS: MR imaging clearly showed well-defined radio frequency lesions and 
provided feedback for treatment planning. The radio frequency lesion boundary 
was well identified as a dark signal rim on T2-weighted images and showed ring 
enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The sequential MR imaging 
showed the radio frequency lesions decreased in volume in all cases, suggesting 
focal control.
CONCLUSION: Stereotactic MR-guided radio frequency brain tumor ablation is a 
feasible and promising technique that can be an attractive brain tumor treatment 
alternative. MR provided not only accurate tumor location but also visualization 
of feedback of thermal tissue changes that reflected therapeutic effect."
7901430,"The great majority of viral mRNAs in mouse C127 cells transformed by bovine 
papillomavirus type 1 (BPV) have a common 3' end at the early polyadenylation 
site which is 23 nucleotides (nt) downstream of a canonical poly(A) consensus 
signal. Twenty percent of BPV mRNA from productively infected cells bypasses the 
early polyadenylation site and uses the late polyadenylation site approximately 
3,000 nt downstream. To inactivate the BPV early polyadenylation site, the early 
poly(A) consensus signal was mutated from AAUAAA to UGUAAA. Surprisingly, this 
mutation did not result in significant read-through expression of downstream 
RNA. Rather, RNA mapping and cDNA cloning experiments demonstrate that virtually 
all of the mutant RNA is cleaved and polyadenylated at heterogeneous sites 
approximately 100 nt upstream of the wild-type early polyadenylation site. In 
addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs 
with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that 
inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise 
very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that 
polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA, 
an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream 
of the minor polyadenylation sites. These experiments indicate that inactivation 
of the major early polyadenylation signal is not sufficient to induce expression 
of the BPV late genes in transformed mouse cells."
7904067,"The mechanism by which an initially uncommitted cell chooses between alternative 
fates is a central issue in developmental biology. In the mammalian thymus, CD4 
helper T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells arise from a common precursor that 
expresses both CD4 and CD8. The choice between the CD4 and CD8 lineage is linked 
to the specificity of the T-cell antigen receptor expressed by a thymocyte, but 
whether lineage commitment is stochastic or instructed has not been definitively 
resolved. We present evidence that expression of a constitutive CD8 transgene 
during thymic selection permits development of mature CD4 cells bearing the 
class I-restricted F5 T-cell antigen receptor. These results suggest that there 
is a stochastic component to the development of class I major histocompatibility 
complex-restricted T cells."
7904121,"Hunter syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder. Determination of 
heterozygotes is of vital importance in genetic counselling. We describe the DNA 
linkage analysis in 6 Hunter syndrome families and compare it to previous 
results based on a serum assay for IDS activity. Our results confirm the 
reliability of the serum assay. The serum test correctly detected 11/12 of the 
1st degree relatives tested by the serum assay (6/7 carriers and 5/5 
non-carriers). The only case with an apparent false negative result in the serum 
test was a daughter of a ""probable heterozygote"" whose serum test was also 
negative. We suggest that in this family the mother represented a case of 
germinal mosaicism and her daughter, based on the serum test, was not a carrier. 
If our interpretation is correct, then the apparent false negative results were 
correct. It is concluded that in families where the mutation is not known and 
DNA analysis is not possible due to the lack of informative RFLPs or due to the 
lack of DNA samples on key individuals, as well as in sporadic cases, the serum 
test should be applied as an alternative option for heterozygote detection."
7913092,"Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10) 
of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals 
affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations 
occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the 
mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to 
Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated 
families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from 
southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance 
syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid 
hormone, both before and after the administration of thyroid hormones, highlight 
the striking intrafamilial heterogeneity in the phenotypical presentation of the 
syndrome."
7914051,"Since the beginning of the neuroleptics in 1952, French psychiatrists have 
proposed a classification of neuroleptics, taking into account the 
pharmacological and therapeutic differences between these drugs. They 
distinguished 3 different clinical effects of neuroleptics: sedative effects, 
effects on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and effects on the negative 
symptoms. The effect of some neuroleptics on negative symptoms is recognized by 
the international community, which considers clozapine to be effective. In 
France, in most cases, the indication of clozapine is still refractory paranoid 
schizophrenia. The effect of this atypical neuroleptic on other types of 
schizophrenic patient is not well known. Remoxipride appears to be as effective 
in treating psychotic symptoms and to have fewer side effects than haloperidol. 
Remoxipride is effective for both positive and negative symptoms. Loxapine has 
been prescribed in France since 1980. Its pharmacological profile is close to 
that of clozapine: it has dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2) and 
adrenergic (alpha 1)-blocking activities. Its best indication seems to be 
paranoid schizophrenia, although some data suggest bipolar action. The bipolar 
action of some new neuroleptics is illustrated by amisulpride, a substitute 
benzamide derivative. The originality of this molecule lies in its two opposite 
actions at two distinct doses. Doses of 600-1200 mg/day are effective against 
positive symptoms; 50-150 mg/day improves negative symptoms. This latter effect 
could be mediated by activation of the dopamine system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

7914262,"The central nervous system lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) can be detected by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the initial perivascular inflammatory 
component is distinguished by the presence of gadolinium enhancement. To assess 
the effect of systemic lymphocyte depletion on disease activity, seven patients 
with MS received a 10-day intravenous course of the humanised monoclonal 
antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CDw52). With some variations in the protocol, enhanced 
cerebral MR images were obtained monthly for 3-4 months before and at least 6 
months after treatment. 28 enhancing areas were detected on the first series of 
7 scans; 51 additional active lesions were identified on 18 scans before 
treatment; 15 were detected on 20 scans done over the next 3 months, but only 2 
active lesions were seen on 23 scans during follow-up beyond 3 months. The 
difference in lesion incidence rate before and after treatment varied and the 
rate ratio was significantly reduced in only three patients. Collectively, in a 
""meta-analysis"", the rate ratios were 0.15 [corrected] (95% CI 0.09-0.24) for 
all seven patients and 0.24 (0.14-0.42; p < 0.001) with exclusion of the patient 
whose scanning schedule differed. The effect of CAMPATH-1H on disease activity 
provides direct, but preliminary, evidence that disease activity in MS depends 
on the availability of circulating lymphocytes and can be prevented by 
lymphocyte depletion. It is too early to say anything about the clinical results 
of treatment with this agent."

region of the Grg gene contains two functional polyadenylation sites that give 
rise to two transcripts that are differentially expressed among adult mouse

7918132,"Isradipine, a 1,4 dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, is a potent 
coronary artery dilator that increases coronary blood flow with little effect on 
cardiac contractility. Isradipine is an approved antihypertensive agent, but its 
antianginal effects have not been well documented. In this placebo-controlled, 
double-blind, parallel-group design study we evaluated the duration of effects 
and safety of isradipine 10 mg bid in male patients with chronic stable angina 
pectoris. Seventy-two patients experiencing moderately severe angina between 3 
and 7.5 minutes during a standard Bruce exercise test received placebo in a 
single-blind manner for 8-14 days. Sixty-one of these patients had reproducible 
treadmill exercise test results on three consecutive occasions and underwent 
further exercise tests at 3, 8, and 12 hours after a placebo period. Patients 
were then randomized (double blind) to either placebo or isradipine 10 mg bid 
for 2 weeks. Symptom-limited exercise tests were repeated predose and at 3, 8, 
and 12 hours after the 0800 hour dose dosing. Exercise duration increased 
significantly from baseline (last qualifying test during the single-blind 
placebo therapy, i.e., 0800 hours predose at visit 4) in the isradipine group 
compared to the placebo group prior to the administration of the 0800 hour dose 
(i.e., 12 hours after the 2000 hour dose) by 51 vs. 18 seconds, p = 0.04; and 
after the administration of the 0800 hour dose at 3 hours by 78 vs. 29 seconds, 
p = 0.005; and at 8 hours by 54 vs. 18 seconds, p = 0.04. Similarly, statistical 
significance was achieved when exercise data were analyzed using visit 4 
(single-blind placebo therapy) corresponding time points as baseline. At 12 
hours after the 0800 hour dose, exercise tolerance did not increase 
significantly after isradipine compared to placebo. Time to 1-mm ST-segment 
depression increased significantly after isradipine at 3 hours post 0800 hour 
dose compared to placebo (87 vs. 7 seconds, p < 0.01) but not at the 0, 8, or 
12-hour postdose time points, regardless of which baseline was used. Isradipine 
therapy did not affect the rate-pressure double product. A significant 
correlation between the mean increase in total exercise time and mean plasma 
isradipine concentration was also present (p = 0.0295). During double-blind 
treatment, drug-related adverse events were experienced by four patients in the 
isradipine group and two patients in the placebo group. None of the patients

7919566,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, biopharmaceutics/pharmacokinetics, 
clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and therapeutic considerations regarding the 
use of tacrine in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
DATA SOURCES: Data from the scientific and professional literature were 
analyzed, interpreted, and summarized. Citations were obtained by performing a 
MEDLINE search using the following indexing terms: tacrine, 
tetrahydroaminoacridine, and Alzheimer's drug therapy. Data also were obtained 
from a summary of the New Drug Application (Summary Basis of Approval of Cognex) 
and from the approved product labeling.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies in Alzheimer's disease have been plagued by 
methodologic inconsistencies and deficiencies. Only efficacy studies subsequent 
to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) issuance of recommendations for 
studies in Alzheimer's disease (1991) were used. Therefore, only double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel design studies of at least three-month's duration 
using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the 
Clinical Interview-Based Impression of Change as efficacy parameters were 
included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Trials were assessed according to the criteria listed above. 
Results were evaluated on the basis of both completed patients and last 
observation carried forward models.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Tacrine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases the 
availability of acetylcholine in muscarinic neurons. It has a mean 
bioavailability after oral administration of about 17 percent and an elimination 
half-life of approximately three hours. Although drug interactions are poorly 
studied, tacrine is metabolized by isoenzyme P-450IA2 and may interact with 
other drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme. Tacrine has been shown to have 
efficacy in mildly to moderately impaired Alzheimer's patients on both 
psychometric testing and a clinician's structured interview. Although 
efficacious, its effects are not dramatic, and it does not affect the ultimate 
course of the disease. Adverse effects are frequent, and significantly elevated 
hepatic transaminase concentrations may occur in approximately 25 percent of 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Tacrine is the first drug approved by the FDA for treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. Although it may improve psychometric test scores in mild to 
moderately impaired patients, it is not a panacea and does not affect the course 
of the disease. Patients must be monitored closely for elevated transaminase, 
cholinergic adverse effects, and interactions with drugs metabolized through 
P-450IA2."
7921533,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dihydropyridine 
calcium antagonist isradipine on left ventricular (LV) structure and function in 
patients with essential hypertension. Cuff blood pressure and Doppler 
echocardiographic variables were assessed in 26 patients with mild to moderate 
hypertension (diastolic blood pressure range 95-110 mmHg) before and after 12 
weeks of therapy with either isradipine 5 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily. The 
study was of double-blind, parallel design, with a placebo run-in period of 15 
days. Three subjects withdrew from isradipine treatment because of flushing and 
2 from enalapril treatment due to cough before completing the study. Both drugs 
significantly reduced cuff systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) 
without affecting heart rate. By virtue of the decrease in both septal wall (p < 
0.01) and posterior wall thicknesses (p < 0.05), isradipine treatment produced a 
significant reduction in LV mass adjusted for height (p < 0.001) in comparison 
with placebo; also LV end-systolic dimension showed a slight decrease (p < 
0.05). Enalapril induced a similar reduction in LV end-systolic dimension (p < 
0.05) but the changes of wall thickness and LV mass did not reach statistical 
significance. In conclusion, our results indicate that isradipine treatment 
improves LV systolic function and causes a significant reduction in LV mass. 
This reduction is observed early in the course of antihypertensive treatment and 
is effective in both patients with and without LV hypertrophy."
7923859,"In the Portuguese population the most frequent form of Gaucher disease is type 
1. The N370S glucocerebrosidase gene mutation accounts for 63% of mutated 
alleles. The frequency of this mutation was accurately determined in the 
Portuguese population, which does not present an Ashkenazi Jewish genetic 
background. A gene frequency of 0.0043, with 95% confidence limits between 
0.0023 and 0.0063, was obtained studying the genomic DNA of 2000 blood cards 
randomly sampled from the national neonatal screening program. On the basis of 
this frequency a significantly high number of homozygotes for the N370S mutation 
should be expected in the Portuguese population. This finding supports the idea 
that the majority of homozygotes for this mutation present a very mild clinical 
phenotype and remain undiagnosed."
7924059,"We reported a 54-year-old HTLV-I seropositive female patient with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), who developed migrating radiculopathy but without chronic 
progressive myelopathy. She occasionally noticed butterfly rash and 
photosensitivity of the skin as well as painful episodes in different joints for 
10 years. She developed pins and needles sensation on her trunk a few days after 
she experienced lumbago with abrupt onset. Neurological examinations revealed 
normal muscular strength, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes without Babinski 
signs, and dysesthesia on her upper extremities and the trunk. The latter 
symptom showed a segmental distribution of spinal nerve roots. And during the 
course of the disease, it migrated in accord with a radicular pattern. This 
sensory disturbance was fairly responsive to corticosteroid treatment. The 
spinal tap yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which showed mononuclear 
pleocytosis (16/mm3) with predominance of CD8+ cytotoxic cells and a positive 
result for anti-HTLV-I antibody. A neurological status deteriorated in parallel 
with non-neurological symptoms as SLE, when the patient had discontinued 
corticosteroids in a tapering course by herself. We postulate that HTLV-I 
infection in this patient modulated original autoimmune reactions as SLE, which 
led to manifestation of migrating radiculopathy possibly due to autoimmunity 
against ganglion cells. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of migrating 
radiculopathy in an SLE patient associated with HTLV-I infection."
7925318,"Motor neurone disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a serious 
progressive neurological disorder, characterized by loss of UMN and LMN. 
Pathological features include characteristic intracytoplasmic MN inclusion 
bodies and appearances on ubiquitin staining. The aetiopathogenesis of the 
disease remains unknown and there is, to date, no effective treatment. Several 
abnormalities have been demonstrated in neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and gene 
expression studies. Abnormalities in glutamate metabolism have led to the 
excitotoxin hypothesis of MN destruction. Other theories include deficits in MN 
trophic factors, trans-synaptic degeneration, impaired ability to detoxify 
putative toxic agents and impaired DNA/RNA metabolism. The existence of familial 
forms, some of which show linkage to markers in chromosome 21, allows a genetic 
approach to the mechanisms of disease. Recent studies suggest that mutations in 
the Cu/Zn SOD gene may be important in some of the familial forms. The atypical 
forms seen in the Western Pacific have stimulated a search for environmental 
agents. Agents undergoing therapeutic trials at present include CNTF, IGF1 
glutamate antagonists, branched-chain amino acids and TRH analogue."
7926300,"Recent data have suggested a key role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in 
the insulin resistance of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(NIDDM). TNF-alpha expression is elevated in the adipose tissue of multiple 
experimental models of obesity. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in one of these 
models improves insulin sensitivity by increasing the activity of the insulin 
receptor tyrosine kinase, specifically in muscle and fat tissues. On a cellular 
level, TNF-alpha is a potent inhibitor of the insulin-stimulated tyrosine 
phosphorylations on the beta-chain of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor 
substrate-1, suggesting a defect at or near the tyrosine kinase activity of the 
insulin receptor. Given the clear link between obesity, insulin resistance, and 
diabetes, these results strongly suggest that TNF-alpha may play a crucial role 
in the systemic insulin resistance of NIDDM. This may allow for new treatments 
of disorders involving resistance to insulin."
7930846,"The BXSB/MpJ (BXSB) murine strain (H-2b) spontaneously develops an autoimmune 
syndrome with features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that affects males 
much earlier than females. A mutant gene located on the BXSB Y chromosome, 
designated Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), is responsible for 
the acceleration of the disease observed in male BXSB mice. Studies on H-2 
congenic and I-E transgenic mice have clearly demonstrated that the MHC class II 
genes play a crucial role in the development or protection of SLE. However, the 
MHC effect can be completely masked by the presence of the Yaa gene in mice with 
certain genetic backgrounds. It is intriguing that the Yaa gene effect is 
selective on autoimmune responses, varying in different lupus-prone mice. 
Studies on immune responses against foreign antigens have shown that the Yaa 
gene potentiates immune responses only against antigens to which mice are 
genetically (H-2-linked) low-responding, but not high-responding. Thus, the 
selective immune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene may be related to 
differences in the capacity of T helper cells specific for given antigens. 
Moreover, studies on Yaa(+)-Yaa- bone marrow cell chimeric mice have suggested 
that a specific cognate interaction of T helper cells with Yaa+ B cells is 
responsible for a selective enhancing effect of immune responses to foreign 
antigens as well as autoantigens. It is significant that unlike the lpr 
mutation, whose abnormality is associated with the capacity of the Fas antigen 
to mediate apoptosis, the Yaa gene by itself is unable to induce significant 
autoimmune responses in mice without apparent SLE background. This suggests that 
the molecular defect of the Yaa gene is likely to differ from that of the lpr 
gene, and that the Yaa gene effect requires the abnormal autosomal genome 
present in lupus-prone mice. Based on these findings, a possible molecular 
nature of the Yaa gene abnormality will be discussed."
7932731,"Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is essential 
for cell proliferation. This homodimeric enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and 
re-ligation of double-stranded DNA required to separate replicated sister 
chromatids. Both biochemical and genetic studies show that its catalytic 
activity is required for chromosome condensation and segregation, and that its 
decatenation activity can be stimulated by a variety of protein kinases in 
vitro. In budding yeast, topoisomerase II is most highly phosphorylated in 
metaphase, and casein kinase II (CKII) was shown to be the major kinase 
modifying topoisomerase II. We have investigated the effects of phosphorylation 
of yeast topoisomerase II by CKII in vitro, by means of gel-retardation and 
filter binding assays. The phosphorylation of the C terminus of topoisomerase II 
by CKII appears to increase the stability of the complex formed with linear DNA 
fragments, while dephosphorylation has the opposite effect. Rephosphorylation of 
phosphatase-treated topoisomerase II by chicken casein kinase II restores a 
stable protein-DNA complex using a linear DNA fragment. The enhanced stability 
of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex is also observed with relaxed circular DNA, 
but not with supercoiled minicircles, in agreement with published results using 
topoisomerase II from Drosophila. Limited proteolysis and probing with 
domain-specific antibodies shows that, with the exception of a weakly modified 
residue between amino acid residues 660 and 1250, all residues modified by 
casein kinase II are in the last 180 amino acid residues of yeast topoisomerase 
II."
7932780,"We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and 
nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the 
heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used 
to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA 
and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci 
USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of 
significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional 
mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different 
genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional 
mutation pressure and nucleotide content of mitochondrial cytochrome b genes. 
Results from a survey of 110 taxa indicate that the cytochrome b genes of most 
taxa are subjected to significant directional mutation pressure and that the 
gene is subject to A+T pressure in most cases. Only in the anseriform bird 
Cairina moschata is the cytochrome b gene subject to significant G+C pressure. 
The GC% at nonsynonymous codon sites decreases proportionately with increasing 
A+T pressure, and with a slope less than one, indicating a presence of selective 
constraints. The cytochrome b genes of insects, nematodes, and eumycotes are 
subject to extreme A+T pressures (microD = 0.123, 0.224, and 0.130) and, in 
parallel, the GC% of the nonsynonymous codon sites has decreased from about 0.44 
in organisms that are not subjected to A+T or G+C pressure to about 0.332, 
0.323, and 0.367, respectively. The distribution of taxa according to the GC% at 
nonsynonymous codon sites and directional mutation pressure supports the notion 
that variation in these parameters is a phylogenetic component."
7934162,"Mouse Tec is a non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase and is highly expressed 
in many hematopoietic cell lines. To investigate the roles of the Tec kinase in 
the human hematopoietic system, we isolated cDNAs encoding the human Tec kinase. 
The human tec cDNAs can encode a peptide of 631 amino acid residues with a 
calculated molecular mass of 73,624. The predicted human Tec protein is highly 
homologous to those of the members of the Tec family including mouse Tec type IV 
(94% homology), mouse Tsk/Itk (60%), and human Btk (57%). The homology between 
human Tec and other members of the Tec family can be observed not only in the 
Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and kinase domains, but also in the N-terminal unique 
domain. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the major transcripts of tec 
could be detected at 2.6 kb and 3.6 kb in a wide range of human hematopoietic 
cell lines including myeloid, B-, and T-cell lineages. Interestingly, high 
expression of the tec gene could be detected in all of the three patients 
examined with myelodysplastic syndrome. The human tec gene was mapped by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to chromosome 4p12."
7935490,"Thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoic acid (RA) are essential for normal vertebrate 
development and are known to coregulate several genes. Early development is 
predominantly retinoic acid sensitive, yet thyroid hormone receptor-alpha (T3R 
alpha) is expressed along with retinoic acid receptors (RAR)-alpha, -beta, and 
-gamma. To determine the role of unliganded T3R alpha in early development and 
on RA-stimulated neural development, we used homologous recombination techniques 
to inactivate both T3R alpha gene alleles in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. 
Loss of both T3R alpha alleles resulted in an increase in basal and RA-induced 
expression of the endogenous RA-responsive genes, RAR beta and alkaline 
phosphatase, which demonstrates that T3R alpha has an inhibitory effect on the 
RA response. A similar magnitude of T3R inhibition of the RA response was seen 
in transient transfection assays of RA response elements in both ES and assays 
of RA response elements in both ES and JEG cells. Cotransfection experiments 
were used to demonstrate that inhibition of the RA response could be mediated by 
T3R alpha 1. The addition of T3R alpha 1, but not the T3R alpha variant c-erbA 
alpha 2, to T3R alpha-null ES cells restored the inhibitory effect on RA-induced 
gene expression. RA-stimulated neural differentiation was seen in the wild-type, 
but not in T3R alpha-null ES, cells, consistent with reports of abnormal neural 
development as a consequence of premature RA stimulation. Our results 
demonstrate that the early expression of unliganded T3R alpha functions to 
modulate the RA response and RA-stimulated neural differentiation."
7936665,"Cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of the RB tumor suppressor protein is 
mediated by a family of G1 cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins including 
the activated cdk4:cyclin D complex. The identification of a cdk4 inhibitor, 
p16INK4, as a target for mutations in cultured tumor lines and primary tumors 
suggested that RB activity may be affected in these cells. We have examined 88 
lung cancer lines for p16INK4 protein expression and have observed a striking 
inverse correlation between the presence of p16INK4 and wildtype RB. We 
demonstrated that only 6/55 (11%) of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples had 
absent p16INK4 protein, and all 6 belonged to the rare subset of SCLC with 
wildtype RB expression. Conversely of 48 SCLC samples with absent or mutant RB, 
all showed detectable levels of p16INK4 protein. In contrast, we observed that 
23/33 (70%) of non-SCLC samples had loss of p16INK4. Twenty-two of 26 non-SCLC 
lines with wildtype RB had absent p16INK4 while 6 of 7 non-SCLC lines with 
absent or mutant RB had detectable p16INK4. The inverse correlation of RB and 
p16INK4 expression and the absence of p16INK4 inactivation in RB (-/-) SCLC 
lines (0/48) confirms a common p16INK4/RB growth suppressor pathway in human 
cancers and provides evidence that p16INK4, and not an adjacent gene on 
chromosome 9p, is a specific target for mutational events."
7939730,"A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in general. However, is there any reason to single this drug out 
for early RA? Mechanistically, it probably works differently in RA than in 
cancer, at least in part. Thus, in addition to dihydrofolate reductase-related 
effects, MTX inhibits aminoimidazocarboxamide transformylase, decreases 
leukotriene B4 production, and increases adenosine release at concentrations 
achieved with low-dose MTX regimens. Clinically, it is well tolerated over 
relatively long periods. Further, a recent meta-analysis of radiology studies 
shows that MTX compares favorably with intramuscular gold and is better than 
azathioprine. Toxicity remains a concern in treating early RA, particularly as 
pulmonary ""hypersensitivity reactions"" continue (1% to 7.6%), infections (both 
fungal and perioperative) are documented, and more cirrhosis is found. With all 
of the above in mind, the use of MTX seems reasonable but not necessarily 
uniformly appropriate and not yet proved for early RA. Studies of MTX in early 
RA, particularly in combination with other drugs, are only beginning."
7944288,"The classic concept of the viability thresholds of ischemia differentiates 
between two critical flow rates, the threshold of electrical failure and the 
threshold of membrane failure. These thresholds mark the upper and lower flow 
limits of the ischemic penumbra which is thought to suffer only functional but 
not structural injury. Recent studies of the functional and metabolic 
disturbances suggest a more complex pattern of thresholds. At declining flow 
rates, protein synthesis is inhibited at first (at a threshold of about 0.55 
ml/gm/min), followed by a stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis (at 0.35 
ml/gm/min), the release of neurotransmitters and the beginning disturbance of 
energy metabolism (at about 0.20 ml/min), and finally the anoxic depolarization 
(< 0.15 ml/gm/min). The penumbra, as defined by the classic flow thresholds, 
does not remain viable for extended periods. Since viability of the tissue 
requires maintenance of energy-dependent metabolic processes, penumbra is 
redefined as a region of constrained blood supply in which the energy metabolism 
is preserved. Imaging of the penumbra by combining autoradiographic cerebral 
blood flow measurements with bioluminescent images of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) demonstrates a gradual expansion of the infarct core (in which ATP is 
depleted) into the penumbra until, after a few hours, the penumbra has 
disappeared. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to 
periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue 
hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate 
increase of collateral blood supply. This explains pharmacological suppression 
of periinfarct depolarizations lowering the threshold of metabolic disturbances 
and reducing the volume of the ischemic infarct."
7944863,"Atrial arrhythmias resistant to medical therapy are still a common indication 
for ablation of the normal atrioventricular conduction pathway (Tawara node and 
His Bundle). However, the development of catheter techniques of intra-atrial 
ablation to destroy arrhythmogenic myocardial zones enables radical cure of the 
arrhythmias with the respect of the nodo-hisian pathway. With respect to common 
flutter, a number of series, including our own, show a 50 to 75% long-term 
success rate. We believe that a very high success rate in the ablation of 
flutter will probably be achieved in a reproducible manner but this will require 
a more accurate understanding of the tachycardia circuit and technological 
developments allowing controlled radio-frequency destruction of bigger atrial 
myocardial zone. Experience of radio-frequency ablation atrial of atrial 
extrasystoles is more limited than that of flutter and there are fewer published 
series. Globally, catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia remains a more 
difficult and a less well codified procedure than that of accessory pathways or 
of intra-nodal reentry. Radio-frequency ablation in this indication is not 
without danger in view of the thinness of the atrial wall. We believe that 
radio-frequency catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias should, for the moment, 
be reserved for centres specialised in the techniques of electro-physiological 
investigation and ablation."
7945327,"Angiogenin is endocytosed by subconfluent endothelial cells, translocated to the 
nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus. It also localizes into the nucleolus 
of digitonin-permeabilized endothelial cells. The peptide RRRGL corresponding to 
residues 31-35 of human angiogenin specifically targets non-nuclear carrier 
proteins such as albumin, an anti-human nucleolus monoclonal antibody and R33A 
angiogenin to the nucleolus of permeabilized endothelial cells. Proteins 
conjugated with a ""mutant"" peptide, RRAGL, are not imported. Fluorescein 
isothiocyanate-conjugated RRRGL is also rapidly imported into the nucleus and 
localized to the nucleolus, whereas the ""mutant"" peptide is not. Residue R33 is 
essential for nuclear translocation and R31 and R32 appear to modulate this 
process. Thus, 31RRRGL35 is a nuclear localization signal responsible for the 
nucleolar targeting of human angiogenin."
7946181,"These are the preliminary data of an open multicenter trial of antihypertensive 
treatment with isradipine as monotherapy (dose, 4.55 +/- 0.56 mg twice daily; n 
= 11) or isradipine (7.5 +/- 0.63 mg twice daily) in combination with bopindolol 
(1.16 +/- 0.12 mg once daily; n = 30) administered for 3 years to patients with 
essential hypertension (WHO classification I or II). Blood pressure was 
significantly decreased in both treatment groups and there was no indication of 
resistance to therapy. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides were 
decreased by the end of the second year of treatment, and there was a tendency 
toward increase in plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL2 
or HDL3). The atherogenic index (ratio between total cholesterol and HDL2 plus 
HDL3) was also decreased. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged in both 
normoglycemic patients and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(NIDDM) during 3 years of therapy. It is concluded that isradipine is safe and 
effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients 
with either hyperlipidemia or NIDDM."
7946779,"Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully 
with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was 
continued. These antithyroid drugs were stopped after the patients had became 
clinically and biochemically euthyroid. During follow up, when treatment with 
amiodarone continued, thyrotoxicosis did not recur. Amiodarone-induced 
thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated 
successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping 
amiodarone treatment."
7947097,"As an approach to the rational design of combination chemotherapy involving the 
anti-cancer DNA topoisomerase II poison etoposide (VP-16), we have studied the 
dynamic changes occurring in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell populations 
during protracted VP-16 exposure. Cytometric methods were used to analyse 
changes in target enzyme availability and cell cycle progression in a SCLC cell 
line, mutant for the tumour-suppressor gene p53 and defective in the ability to 
arrest at the G1/S phase boundary. At concentrations up to 0.25 microM VP-16, 
cells became arrested in G2 by 24 h exposure, whereas at concentrations 0.25-2 
microM G2 arrest was preceded by a dose-dependent early S-phase delay, confirmed 
by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Recovery potential was determined by 
stathmokinetic analysis and was studied further in aphidicolin-synchronised 
cultures released from G1/S and subsequently exposed to VP-16 in early S-phase. 
Cells not experiencing a VP-16-induced S-phase delay entered G2 delay dependent 
upon the continued presence of VP-16. These cells could progress to mitosis 
during a 6-24 h period after drug removal. Cells experiencing an early S-phase 
delay remained in long-term G2 arrest with greatly reducing ability to enter 
mitosis up to 24 h after removal of VP-16. Irreversible G2 arrest was delimited 
by the induction of significant levels of DNA cleavage or fragmentation, not 
associated with overt apoptosis, in the majority of cells. Western blotting of 
whole-cell preparations showed increases in topoisomerase II levels (up to 
4-fold) attributable to cell cycle redistribution, while nuclei from cells 
recovering from S-phase delay showed enhanced immunoreactivity with an 
anti-topoisomerase II alpha antibody. The results imply that traverse of G1/S 
and early S-phase in the presence of a specific topoisomerase II poison gives 
rise to progressive low-level trapping of topoisomerase II alpha, enhanced 
topoisomerase II alpha availability and the subsequent irreversible arrest in G2 
of cells showing limited DNA fragmentation. We suggest that protracted, low-dose 
chemotherapeutic regimens incorporating VP-16 are preferentially active towards 
cells attempting G1/S transition and have the potential for increasing the 
subsequent action of other topoisomerase II-targeted agents through target 
enzyme modulation. Combination modalities which prevent such dynamic changes 
occurring would act to reduce the effectiveness of the VP-16 component."
7947207,"Gluten-free diets have been used in the treatment of patients with dermatitis 
herpetiformis in our department since 1967. Of the 212 patients with dermatitis 
herpetiformis attending between 1967 and 1992, 133 managed to take the diet, and 
78 of these achieved complete control of their rash by diet alone. Of the 
remaining 55 patients taking a gluten-free diet, all but three were taking 
partial diets; over half of these patients managed to substantially reduce the 
dose of medication required. Of the 77 patients taking a normal diet, eight 
entered spontaneous remission, giving a remission rate of 10%; a further two 
patients who had been taking gluten-free diets were found to have remitted when 
they resumed normal diets. Loss of IgA from the skin was observed in 10 of 41 
(24%) patients taking strict gluten-free diets. These patients had been taking 
their diets for an average of 13 years (range 5-24 years), and their rash had 
been controlled by diet alone for an average of 10 years (range 3-16 years). The 
advantages of a gluten-free diet in the management of patients with dermatitis 
herpetiformis are: (i) the need for medication is reduced or abolished; (ii) 
there is resolution of the enteropathy, and (iii) patients experience a feeling 
of well-being after commencing the diet. Thus, we propose that a gluten-free 
diet is the most appropriate treatment for patients with dermatitis 
herpetiformis."
7952245,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was first recognized as a life-threatening 
complication of dopamine receptor antagonists characterized by extrapyramidal 
disturbances, hyperthermia, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Concepts 
of NMS have changed because medications other than classic neuroleptic drugs 
have been implicated as triggering agents and because syndromes identical to NMS 
have been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease withdrawn from their 
medication or suffering akinetic hyperthermic parkinsonian crisis. The 
neurochemical key features in all these conditions are probably functional 
dopamine deficiency and ensuing hyperactivity of excitatory amino acid 
neurotransmission in the basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Recognition of NMS is 
the most important step in its management; the outcome is good if causative 
drugs are discontinued or if parkinsonian therapy is readjusted. Supportive care 
includes management of hyperthermia and fluid replacement. Controversial 
therapeutic measures include the application of dopamine receptor agonists, 
excitatory amino acid antagonists, or dantrolene. Psychiatric patients with a 
history of NMS and psychotic relapse necessitating neuroleptic drugs do not 
commonly redevelop NMS when reexposed to dopamine receptor antagonists but may 
be treated most safely with atypical neuroleptic drugs such as clozapine."

on serum thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), 3,3'5'-triiodothyronine 
(reverse T3), free T4, free T3 concentrations, and the serum T4 and T3 
concentrations in response to administration of thyrotropin were studied. Serum 
thyroid hormone concentrations were not different between eight dogs with 
spontaneous congestive heart failure and normal age matched control dogs. Seven 
dogs with experimental heart failure were tested before and after induction of 
congestive heart failure by rapid ventricular pacing. Mean serum T4 and free T3 
concentrations were decreased and mean serum reverse T3 concentration was 
increased following induction of heart failure. The serum T4 and T3 responses to 
thyrotropin were not altered. Thyroid gland morphology appeared normal in dogs 
with experimental heart failure. Experimental congestive heart failure, similar 
to some other nonthyroidal illnesses, alters thyroid hormone secretion and 
metabolism in dogs."
7955262,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension commonly occurs after cardiac surgery and requires 
therapy to prevent the potentially deleterious effects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: After coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), 177 
patients with elevated blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg during the initial 6-hour 
postsurgical period were selected for this random blinded, parallel study to 
receive intravenous infusions of either isradipine (n = 90) or sodium 
nitroprusside (n = 87). Isradipine produced a statistically significant decrease 
in mean arterial pressure (MAP, delta-23 mmHg) during a 90-minute treatment 
period. Target MAP (< or = 85 mmHg or a decrease of 10 mmHg, if baseline MAP was 
between 90 and 95 mmHg) was achieved in 94% of patients 30 minutes after 
initiation of isradipine infusion (total mean dose, 411 micrograms); target MAP 
was achieved in 75% of nitroprusside-treated patients (total mean dose, 1708 
micrograms). The mean time to control MAP was 18 minutes for isradipine compared 
with 24 minutes for nitroprusside. Global smoothness in MAP control was graded 
on a scale of 0 (not controlled) to 5 (excellent). Approximately 76% of 
isradipine-treated patients received a rating of > or = 3 (mean score, 3.5); 40% 
of the sodium nitroprusside-treated patients achieved a score of > or = 3 (mean 
score, 2.0). Both isradipine and nitroprusside produced statistically 
significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, a decrease in 
systemic vascular resistance, and increases in heart rate, cardiac index, and 
stroke volume index. Isradipine produced no significant decreases in pulmonary 
artery occlusion wedge pressure compared with nitroprusside.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous isradipine was effective and well tolerated in patients 
with hypertension after CABG and offers an additional therapeutic option to 
treat patients after cardiac surgery."
7995828,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate any potential 
hemodynamic effect of intravenously administered triiodothyronine in patients 
undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients were randomized in this single-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial. Hemodynamic parameters including heart rate, stroke 
volume index, cardiac index, pulmonary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular 
resistances, systemic vascular resistances, and mean blood pressure, were 
compared between the two groups preoperatively, before the initiation of 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 5 minutes after the end of CPB, and 2, 4, 10, 16, 
and 22 hours thereafter.
INTERVENTION: Triiodothyronine was administered as a bolus infusion over a 1 min 
period after removal of the aortic cross-clamp, (0.15 microgram/kg), before the 
end of CPB (0.1 microgram/kg), 4 hours after the end of CPB (0.1 microgram/kg), 
9 hours after CPB (0.1 microgram/kg), and 14 hours after CPB (0.1 microgram/kg). 
Patients received inotropes, vasodilators, and diuretics only if specifically 
indicated.
RESULTS: Plasma FT3 levels were higher in the T3 group, but within the normal 
range. No significant differences were noted in the pre and post CPB 
hemodynamics between the two groups for the most part of the study except that 
heart rate was increased in T3 group. A greater number of patients in the 
control group received vasodilators. No adverse reactions were noted with 
triiodothyronine administration.
CONCLUSION: Triiodothyronine administration in patients undergoing 
cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is safe, may lessen the need for pharmacological 
(vasodilator) therapy, but may increase heart rate."
7997071,"Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids localized to the outer leaflet of the plasma 
membrane of vertebrate cells. The highest ganglioside concentration of any organ 
is found in the mammalian brain, where the gangliosides are enriched in the 
neuronal membrane, particularly in the synapses. There are four major brain 
gangliosides with the same neutral tetrasaccharide core to which one to three 
sialic acids are linked--the simplest being the GM1-ganglioside. These 
gangliosides have been shown to have neuritogenic and neuronotrophic activity 
and to facilitate repair of neuronal tissue after mechanical, biochemical or 
toxic injuries. Mixtures of native bovine brain gangliosides were adopted for 
pharmacological use in the treatment of peripheral nerve damage, and 
GM1-ganglioside has been applied for the treatment of CNS injuries and diseases. 
Beneficial effects of GM1 have been documented in the treatment of stroke and 
spinal cord injuries, particularly when the treatment has been initiated within 
a few hours of the acute event. Continuous intraventricular infusion of GM1 has 
recently been shown to have a significant beneficial effect in Alzheimer disease 
of early onset (AD Type I)."
7998766,"Expansion of trinucleotide repeats is now recognized as a major cause of 
neurological disease. At least seven disorders result from trinucleotide repeat 
expansion: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), two fragile X 
syndromes of mental retardation (FRAXA and FRAXE), myotonic dystrophy, 
Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), and 
dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The expanded trinucleotide repeats 
are unstable, and the phenomenon of anticipation, i.e., worsening of disease 
phenotype over successive generations, correlates with increasing expansion 
size. In this review, we compare the clinical and molecular features of the 
trinucleotide repeat diseases, which may be classified into two types. Fragile X 
and myotonic dystrophy are multisystem disorders usually associated with large 
expansions of untranslated repeats, while the four neurodegenerative disorders, 
SBMA, Huntington's disease, SCA1, and DRPLA, are caused by smaller expansions of 
CAG repeats within the protein coding portion of the gene. CAG repeats encode 
polyglutamine tracts. Polyglutamine tract expansion thus appears to be a common 
mechanism of inherited neurodegenerative disease. Although polyglutamine tract 
lengthening presumably has a toxic gain of function effect in the CAG 
trinucleotide repeat disorders, the basis of this neuronal toxicity remains 
unknown."
7998771,"During 1990 to 1991, through a national surveillance program for poliomyelitis,

37 were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The average annual incidence

benign than reported in other pediatric series. There were low rates of 
hospitalization (57%), respiratory compromise (8%), and intubation (5%). The 
overall severity, however, was similar to that described in previous reports, 
with a 3% case-fatality rate and an 81% total recovery rate at 12 months. 
Seventy-six percent of patients had symptom onset during January to April, the 
warmest months of the year. Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible 
exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak 
incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. There was no correlation between 
occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome and prior immunization."
7999980,"We review the main features of human mitochondrial function and structure, and 
in particular mitochondrial transcription, translation, and replication cycles. 
Furthermore, some pecularities such as mitochondria's high polymorphism, the 
existence of mitochondrial pseudogenes, and the various considerations to take 
into account when studying mitochondrial diseases will also be mentioned. 
Mitochondrial syndromes mostly affecting the nervous system have, during the 
past few years, been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) alterations such 
as deletions, duplications, mutations and depletions. We suggest a possible 
classification of mitochondrial diseases according to the kind of mt DNA 
mutations: structural mitochondrial gene mutation as in LHON (Leber's Hereditary 
Optic Neuropathy) and NARP (Neurogenic muscle weakness, Ataxia and Retinitis 
Pigmentosa) as well as some cases of Leigh's syndrome; transfer RNA and 
ribosomal RNA mitochondrial gene mutation as in MELAS (Mitochondrial 
Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike Episodes) or MERRF (Myoclonic 
Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers) or deafness with aminoglycoside; structural 
with transfer RNA mitochondrial gene mutations as observed in large-scale 
deletions or duplications in Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson's syndrome, diabetes 
mellitus with deafness, and CPEO (Chronic Progressive External Ophtalmoplegia). 
Depletions of the mt DNA may also be classified in this category. Even though 
mutations are generally maternally inherited, most of the deletions are 
sporadic. However, multiple deletions or depletions may be transmitted in a 
mendelan trait which suggests that nuclear gene products play a primary role in 
these processes. The relationship between a mutation and a particular phenotype 
is far from being fully understood. Gene dosage and energic threshold, which are 
tissue-specific, appear to be the best indicators. However, the recessive or 
dominant behavior of both the wild type or the mutated genome appears to play a 
significant role, which can be verified with in vitro studies."
8000104,"An autopsied case of systemic lupus erythematosus with pulmonary hypertension is 
reported. A 29-year-old woman with a seven-year history of polyarthralgia, 
butterfly rash, nephrotic syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon was admitted because 
of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Tests for antinuclear antibody, 
anti-cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant were positive. 
Echocardiographic examination revealed right ventricular hypertrophy and a 
moderate pericardial effusion. Estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure 
was 53 mmHg. Despite treatment with corticosteroids including pulse 
methylprednisolone therapy, lipo-PGE1 and warfarin, she died of progressive

8000657,"BACKGROUND: Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa. This study was 
undertaken to define factors affecting outcome of blacks from South Africa with 
melanoma.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the management and outcome of 63 black 
patients with malignant melanoma treated at a major referral center during a 14 
year period is presented. Data evaluated included patient demographic and 
clinical characteristics, stage at presentation, tumor site, histologic type, 
treatment, and subsequent cure. Survival curves were calculated for stage and 
site of disease.
RESULT: The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years 
(range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot 
was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual 
melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion 
could not be found. Thirty patients presented with stage I disease, two with 
stage II, 23 with stage III, and nine with disseminated metastatic disease. 
Acral lentiginous melanoma was the most common histogenetic type (34 patients), 
nodular melanoma occurred in ten patients, and superficial spreading melanoma 
occurred in three patients. The mean Breslow depth was 6.15 mm (range of 1 to 25 
mm). Patients with localized disease were treated by wide local excision and 
split skin graft, while patients with melanoma in the nailbed were treated by 
amputation of the involved digit. Sixteen patients are alive after a mean 
follow-up period of 82.1 months, 44 have died after a mean of 12.7 months, and 
five patients have been unavailable for follow-up evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result 
of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease. An 
active education program may reduce mortality by detecting the disease earlier."
8001864,"The deficiency of steroid 5 alpha-reductase leads to the disturbances in sex 
differentiation that cause symptoms of male pseudohermaphroditism. The methods 
of DNA analysis used to diagnose mutations of steroid 5 alpha-reductase gene

deficiency of steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 described so far in literature, the 
analysis of SRD5A2 gene revealed two ""major"" deletions, one ""minor"" deletion, 16 
point mutations (incl. 5 transitions and 11 transversions), in one case a 
mutation causing premature termination of translation and in one case mutation 
leading to defective splicing of the mRNA. The mutations localized in exons 2

8004674,"McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by 
abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. We have assembled 
a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb 
deletion was detected by screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole 
cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The 
mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to 
the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics 
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence 
analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations 
at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct 
evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome."
8006040,"Previous studies have shown that pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) is 
composed of a 43-kDa polypeptide with a short NH2-terminal domain, a collagen 
sequence, and a COOH-terminal C-type lectin domain. In the present studies, 
ultrastructural and biochemical techniques were used to examine the quaternary 
structure of native rat SP-D (rSP-D). Electron microscopy of freeze-dried 
preparations demonstrated a highly homogeneous population of molecules with four 
identical rod-like arms (46 nm in length), each with an 8-9-nm diameter globular 
terminal expansion. The arms, which are similar in diameter to the type I 
collagen helix (approximately 4 nm), emanate from the central ""hub"" in two pairs 
that closely parallel each other for their first 10 nm. This structure is 
consistent with hydrodynamic studies that predict an highly asymmetric and 
extended molecule (f/f0 = 3.26) with a large Stokes radius (Rs = 18 nm). Pepsin 
digestion gave glycosylated, trimeric collagenous fragments (43 +/- 4 nm, 17 
kDa/chain). Trimeric subunits containing intact triple helical domains were also 
liberated from SP-D dodecamers by sulfhydryl reduction under non-denaturing 
conditions. Digestion of rSP-D with bacterial collagenase generated a 
COOH-terminal carbohydrate binding fragment and a smaller peptide (approximately 
12 kDa, unreduced) that contains interchain disulfide bonds. Electron microscopy 
also demonstrated higher orders of multimerization, with as many as 8 molecules 
associated at the hub. These studies demonstrate that SP-D is assembled as 
homopolymers of four identical trimeric subunits, that interactions between the 
amino-terminal domains of the trimers are stabilized by interchain disulfide 
bonds, and that SP-D molecules can associate to form complex multimolecular 
assemblies."

frequently associated as an intervention for stress incontinence, they have been 
found to be effective in significantly reducing urge incontinence. 4. Nurses are 
in a key position to identify and treat urinary incontinence among the elderly,

8007629,"The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment 
of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most 
common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were 
Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), 
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, 
and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were 
susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. 
aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). 
It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with 
respiratory tract infections."
8008028,"BACKGROUND: The fibrillin gene encodes a protein in the extracellular matrix, 
and this protein is widely distributed in elastic tissues. The fibrillin gene is 
the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. This disorder shows a high 
degree of clinical variability both between and within families. Each family 
appears to have a unique mutation in the fibrillin gene, which precludes the 
routine use of mutation screening for presymptomatic diagnosis of the disorder. 
The goal of this study was to develop a widely applicable method of molecular 
diagnosis.
METHODS: We used three newly characterized intragenic sites of normal DNA 
repeat-sequence variation (i.e., polymorphisms) as markers to follow the 
inheritance pattern of specific copies (alleles) of the fibrillin gene in 
multiple kindreds with various clinical features of Marfan's syndrome.
RESULTS: The polymorphic markers allowed identification of the particular copy 
of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with Marfan's syndrome in 13 of the 14 
families tested. In 11 families a definite presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's 
syndrome could be made in family members who had only equivocal manifestations 
of the disorder. In two other families, some family members demonstrated either 
classic Marfan's syndrome or a milder but closely related phenotype. The copy of 
the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with classic Marfan's syndrome was not 
inherited by family members with the latter, atypical, form of the disease. 
These milder phenotypes, previously diagnosed as Marfan's syndrome, were not 
associated with aortic involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: These results document the usefulness of novel polymorphic DNA 
repeat sequences in the presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome. Our 
findings also demonstrate that the various clinical phenotypes seen in selected 
families may be due not to single fibrillin mutations, but rather to different 
genetic alterations. These findings underscore the need for a modification of 
the current diagnostic criteria for Marfan's syndrome in order to achieve 
accurate risk assessment."
8009147,"We report a case of neuromuscular disease overlap between myasthenia gravis and 
Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES). Clinical features were those of LES and occurred 
insidiously in this 68-year old man: proximal weakness predominant in the lower 
limbs, generalized areflexia, dryness of the mouth and partial right eye palsy. 
Investigations disclosed a small cell lung cancer. On the other hand, an 
electrophysiological study showed low amplitude of all motor evoked potentials, 
and significant decrement in the median nerve at repeated 3 Hz stimulation, but 
failed to disclose any increment of the motor evoked potential in abductor 
digiti minimi pedis muscle after both maximal voluntary contraction and repeated 
20 Hz stimulation. In addition, the patient improved under anticholinesterase 
drugs, but failed to respond to guanidine. Titres for both 
anti-acetylcholine-receptor antibodies and calcium channel antibodies were 
negative. The relationship between our case and recently reported cases of 
co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis is 
discussed."
8010709,"Translocations involving acrocentric chromosomes are frequent in chromosomal 
male infertility. Robertsonian translocations are usually concerned whereas 
reciprocal translocations between acrocentric chromosomes are rarely 
encountered. The first reciprocal translocation involving the long arms of the 
two acrocentric chromosomes 13 and 14 [46,XY,t(13,14)(q33,q22)] is presented in 
this paper. The patient presents a severe oligoasthenospermia; testicular 
histology shows an important impairment of spermatogenesis. The quadrivalent is 
present in all the pachytene nuclei analyzed. A straight contact between the sex 
vesicle and the quadrivalent was found in 40.9% of the nuclei. A frequent 
asynapsis is localized at the breakpoint region (33.8%). The XY-autosome 
association was obtained by the central asynapsis and/or by the terminal 
chromomeres of the acrocentric chromosomes involved in the translocation."
8015613,"The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II is 
essential in vivo, and is found in either an unphosphorylated (IIa) or 
hyperphosphorylated (IIo) form. The Drosophila uninduced hsp70 and hsp26 genes, 
and the constitutively expressed beta-1 tubulin and Gapdh-2 genes, contain an 
RNA polymerase II complex which pauses after synthesizing a short transcript. We 
report here that, using an in vivo ultraviolet crosslinking technique and 
antibodies directed against the IIa and IIo forms of the CTD, these paused 
polymerases have an unphosphorylated CTD. For genes containing a 5' paused 
polymerase, passage of the paused RNA polymerase into an elongationally 
competent mode in vivo coincides with phosphorylation of the CTD. Also, the 
level of phosphorylation of the CTD of elongating polymerases is shown not to be 
related to the level of transcription, but is promoter specific."
8021081,"BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in several areas in the 
Sudan. The disease is associated with depressed cellular immunity. Tinea 
versicolor is a normal commensal of the skin which can become pathogenic 
particularly in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity. Patients with VL 
have a high prevalence of tinea versicolor.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients with parasitologic confirmation of VL 
were screened for tinea versicolor infection. In the suspected cases the 
diagnosis was made by demonstrating the fungal hyphae and spores in skin 
scrapings. All patients were treated with sodium stibogluconate.
RESULTS: Of the 130 patients with VL, 10.8% were found to have severe tinea 
versicolor. The fungal infection developed or became worse with the start of VL. 
After successful treatment of VL, the tinea lesions disappeared completely or 
decreased in severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressed cell-mediated immunity that is a feature of VL is the 
probable underlying cause for fungal infection. Tinea infection during the 
course of VL is to be distinguished from lesions of post-kala-azar dermal 
leishmaniasis."
8022486,"Many cytokines function through interaction with receptors of the cytokine 
receptor superfamily. Although lacking catalytic domains, cytokine receptors 
couple ligand binding to induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent 
studies have shown that one or more of the Janus kinase family members (Jaks) 
associate with cytokine receptors and are tyrosine phosphorylated and activated 
following ligand binding. Here we describe a new Jak family kinase, Jak-3, and 
demonstrate that Jak-3, and to a lesser extent Jak-1, are tyrosine 
phosphorylated and Jak-3 is activated in the responses to interleukin-2 and 
interleukin-4 in T cells and myeloid cells. Jak-3 activation requires the 
serine-rich, membrane-proximal domain of the interleukin-2 receptor beta-chain, 
but does not require the acidic domain that is required for association and 
activation of Src family kinases."
8022508,"OBJECTIVE: Determining the factors which influence the success of training 
therapy in women suffering from urinary incontinence.
DESIGN: Descriptive.
SETTING: Thirteen general practices in Nijmegen and environs, the Netherlands.
METHOD: A total of 110 women between 20 and 65 years old, suffering from urinary 
incontinence were examined by their general practitioners. Age, personality, 
parity, psychological features and type, duration, severity, beginning of the 
disease, as well as the presence of cystocele or prolapse were recorded. Women 
were asked about their own experiences regarding factors that influenced 
success. The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress 
incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence. Outcomes and compliance 
were measured 3 and 12 months after start of treatment by means of a so-called 
incontinence diary.
RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished 
from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Compliance was the most important 
contribution to success. Patients were more motivated to practise when the 
subjective burden of the urine loss was more severe. Other features did not 
influence success."
8023851,"Deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC; alpha 4 beta 4) results in the 
rare, autosomal recessive disease propionic acidemia. Cell fusion experiments 
have revealed two complementation groups, pccA and pccB, corresponding to 
defects of the PCCA (alpha-subunit) and PCCB (beta-subunit) genes, respectively. 
The pccBCC group includes subgroups, pccB and pccC, which are thought to reflect 
interallelic complementation between certain mutations of the PCCB gene. In this 
study, we have identified the mutations in two pccB, one pccC, and two pccBC 
cell lines and have deduced those alleles participating in interallelic 
complementation. One pccB line was a compound heterozygote of Pro228Leu and 
Asn536Asp. The latter mutation was also detected in a noncomplementing pccBC 
line. This leaves Pro228Leu responsible for complementation in the pccB cells. 
The second pccB line contained an insertional duplication, dupKICK140-143, and a 
splice mutation IVS + 1 G-->T, located after Lys466. We suggest that the dupKICK 
mutation is the complementing allele, since the second allele is incompatible 
with normal splicing. The pccC line studied was homozygous for Arg410Trp, which 
is necessarily the complementing allele in that line. For a second pccC line, we 
previously had proposed that delta Ile408 was the complementing allele. We now 
show that its second allele, ""Ins.Del,"" a 14-bp deletion replaced by a 12-bp 
insertion beginning at codon 407, fails to complement in homozygous form. We 
conclude that the interallelic complementation results from mutations in domains 
that can interact between beta-subunits in the PCC heteromer to restore 
enzymatic function. On the basis of sequence homology with the Propionibacterium 
shermanii transcarboxylase 12S subunit, we suggest that the pccC domain, defined 
by Ile408 and Arg410, may involve the propionyl-CoA binding site."
8024257,"Wearing-off phenomenon that complicates levodopa therapy of Parkinson's disease 
has been attributed to a reduction in striatal dopamine storage due to the 
progressive degeneration of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals. To determine 
whether postsynaptic mechanisms also contribute to these response fluctuations, 
the duration of the antiparkinsonian response in parkinsonian patients grouped 
by disease severity was compared following discontinuation of a steady-state 
optimal-dose infusion of apomorphine. Although the plasma half-life of this 
dopamine receptor agonist remained constant, its mean efficacy half-time 
declined from 66 minutes in early, levodopa-naive patients to 33 minutes in 
advanced, complicated parkinsonians (p < 0.005). Since the motor effects of 
apomorphine do not depend on the presence of dopaminergic terminals, changes at 
the postsynaptic level undoubtedly contribute to the diminished response 
duration. The only slightly greater attenuation of levodopa's motor effects 
observed previously under similar conditions suggests these postjunctional 
alterations, possibly involving relatively plastic striatal dopaminoceptive 
systems, account for most of the shortening in the duration of levodopa action 
that underlie wearing-off fluctuations."
8025896,"Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are common causes of morbidity and 
mortality. These tumors can occur sporadically or in individuals with genetic 
disorders predisposing to cancer development. Such syndromes include 
neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as 
well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome. 
There may also be familial syndromes resulting in glioma or meningioma alone, 
but these are not well understood. Development of sporadic gliomas is 
accompanied by a number of molecular genetic alterations, including activation 
of dominant oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Some of these 
alterations may be associated with progression of gliomas to their most 
malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme. However, at this time molecular genetic 
analysis of gliomas does not provide better prognosis than histopathological 
staging. Recently, experimental treatments of gliomas in rodents, using gene 
therapy, have been reported. Results of these studies have been promising, and 
these techniques may represent a future direction for therapy in humans."
8026537,"We studied the role of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in 
non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the rabbit sphincter of 
Oddi by recording changes in isometric tension in response to electrical field 
stimulation in two series of experiments. In a first set of experiments, biliary 
sphincters of Oddi removed from New Zealand white rabbits were placed 
horizontally in an organ bath containing oxygenized, buffered (pH 7.4) Krebs 
solution. Contractile responses of the whole sphincter to field stimulation were 
determined. In the second set of experiments, sphincter of Oddi was divided into 
two parts and the effects of field stimulation were studied separately on areas 
close to the duodenal papilla (area I) and areas close to the common bile duct 
(area II). In the whole sphincter of Oddi, field stimulation induced an initial 
twitch-like contraction followed by relaxation proportional to the number of 
stimuli (3 and 10 stimuli at 20 Hz, 50 V, 0.1 ms). The magnitude of the 
contractile responses was considerably reduced by 1 microM atropine, 
phentolamine and oxprenolol (NANC solution). Field stimulation produced 
dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to 
the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation 
with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field 
stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter 
of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field 
stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence 
of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8027999,"The three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b, a short-chain neurotoxic 
peptide purified from the venom of the sea snake Laticauda semifasciata, was 
determined in aqueous solution by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic 
resonance and simulated annealing-based calculations. On the basis of 883 
assigned nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities, 676 final distance 
constraints were derived and used together with 38 torsion angle (phi, chi 1) 
constraints, four distance constraints derived from disulfide bridges and 30 
distance constraints derived from hydrogen bonds. A total of 14 converged 
structures were obtained from 50 runs of calculations. The atomic 
root-mean-square difference about the mean coordinate positions (excluding the 
residues 18 to 22) is 0.60 A for backbone atoms (N, C alpha and C'). The protein 
consists of a core region from which three finger-like loops emerge outwards. It 
includes a short, two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet of residues 2 to 5 and 13 
to 16, a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues 23 to 30, 35 
to 41 and 50 to 56, and four disulfide bridges in the core region. Comparison 
with two crystal structures of erabutoxin b at 1.4 A and 1.7 A resolution 
indicated that the solution and the crystal structures were very similar, but 
less defined regions were observed at the localized region of the tip of the 
central loop and the outside of the third loop in solution. Other short-chain 
alpha-neurotoxins showed structural characteristics similar to those of 
erabutoxin b."
8029151,"Clinical course and results of therapy were analysed in the group of 92 
children, aged between 3 and 9 years, with diagnosed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
The obtained results of an analysis have shown that Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
origin is not clear--causative factor can not be established in 1/3 of patients 
whereas in 1/2 of them abnormal course of pregnancy and perinatal period is 
noted. Together with seizures of various origin, other focal neurological 
symptoms, mental retardation and abnormalities in CT scans of the brain are 
frequently seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical course, 
prognosis and results of therapy are largely dependent on the degree of mental 
development before the onset of epileptic seizures, course of pregnancy and 
perinatal period, and the time of therapy. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
require relative polytherapy in which valproic acid derivatives are 
predominating together with benzodiazepines, and temporary corticosteroids. An 
improvement was achieved in about 30% of the treated children. Prognosis in the 
remaining 70% of children is rather poor. Irregular administration of drugs, 
frequent changes of anti-epileptic agents, too low doses and abnormal 
environmental effects (abnormal parental attitudes) affect the results of 
therapy. An emphasis is on the poor prognosis in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
proceeded with West syndrome."
8031346,"OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the risk associated with in utero exposure to lithium.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Data were obtained from all published studies, 
in multiple languages, referenced in MEDLINE, Toxline, and the Lithium 
Information Center databases. Unpublished studies were not included. The search 
terms were lithium, pregnancy, teratogen, abnormalities (drug induced), 
Ebstein's anomaly, and adverse effects.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In the 1970s a very strong association was 
suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's 
anomaly of the heart in the offspring. The relative risk for Ebstein's anomaly 
among such children was estimated to be 400 on the basis of data collected from 
a registry of voluntarily submitted cases. More recent controlled epidemiologic 
studies have consistently shown a lower risk. No women who took lithium during 
pregnancy were found among four case-control studies of Ebstein's anomaly 
involving 25, 34, 59, and 89 affected children, respectively. In two cohort 
studies, risk ratios of 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 7.7) and 1.5 
(95% CI, 0.4 to 6.8) for all congenital anomalies have been observed. The risk 
ratios for cardiac malformations in these studies were 7.7 (95% CI, 1.5 to 41.2) 
and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.1 to 18.3), respectively.
CONCLUSION: While initial information regarding the teratogenic risk of lithium 
treatment was derived from biased retrospective reports, more recent 
epidemiologic data indicate that the teratogenic risk of first-trimester lithium 
exposure is lower than previously suggested. The clinical management of women 
with bipolar disorder who have childbearing potential should be modified with 
this revised risk estimate."
8034708,"The molecular basis for commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage and 
mechanisms by which eosinophil-specific genes are expressed and regulated during 
differentiation is unknown. Expression of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) is 
restricted to the eosinophil lineage. To understand the mechanisms involved in 
transcriptional regulation of EPO gene expression, we clone the region of the 
EPO gene upstream of the transcriptional start site and analyzed the cis-acting 
elements required for EPO promoter activity in an eosinophil-inducible leukemic 
cell line, HL-60-C15. The 5'-flanking region of the EPO gene containing 1.5 
kilobases of sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site was subcloned 
into the promoterless pXP2-luciferase vector. The EPO-pXP2 construct and 5' 
deletion mutants were electroporated into HL-60-C15 cells and luciferase 
reporter activity assessed. The -1.5-kilobase EPO-pXP2 promoter construct 
reproducibly expressed > 120-fold more luciferase activity than did promoterless 
pXP2, and a 12-fold (90%) decrease in promoter activity was obtained when 
sequences between -122 and -45 base pairs (bp) were deleted. The specificity of 
the EPO promoter for the eosinophil lineage was analyzed by transfecting the 
EPO-pXP2 constructs and deletion mutants into HL-60-C15 cells and the parental 
HL-60 line; EPO promoter activity was 8-10-fold less in the HL-60 parental line, 
suggesting lineage specific elements in the -122 to -45 bp region. To further 
characterize regulatory sequences important for promoter activity, we performed 
linker-scanning analysis on the -122 to -45 bp region and identified a number of 
positively and negatively acting elements in the promoter. DNase I footprinting 
was performed with HL-60-C15, HL-60, and HeLa nuclear extracts to identify 
nuclear proteins that may bind to the functional elements; these experiments 
identified three protected regions of the EPO promoter which correspond to the 
functional segments defined by linker-scanning analysis and which contain 
consensus, potential binding sites for Egr-1, H4TF-1, PuF, CTCF, UBP-1, and 
GaEII transcription factors. Further study of EPO promoter regulation should 
elucidate unique transcriptional features of eosinophil gene regulation in 
granulocyte development."
8035789,"Cardiac muscle-restricted expression of the alpha-myosin heavy-chain (alpha-MHC)

activity from the wild-type promoter by approximately 85% in the adult rat 
heart, demonstrating that these sites were positive regulatory elements. 
alpha-MHC, beta-MHC, and chicken cardiac troponin T (cTnT) M-CAT sites 
interacted with an M-CAT-binding factor (MCBF) from rat heart nuclear extracts 
that was immunologically related to transcriptional enhancer factor 1, a factor 
that binds within the simian virus 40 enhancer. The factor that bound the A-rich 
region (ARF) was antigenically related to the RSRF family of proteins, ARF was 
distinct from myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) on the basis of 
DNA-binding specificity and developmental expression. Like MEF-2, ARF 
DNA-binding activity was present in the heart and brain; however, no ARF 
activity was detected in extracts from skeletal muscle or C2C12 myotubes. MCBF 
and ARF DNA-binding activities were developmentally regulated with peak levels 
in the 1- to 2-day neonatal heart. The activity of both factors increased nearly 
fivefold in adult rat hearts subjected to a pressure overload. By comparison, 
the levels of alpha-MHC binding factor 2 did not change during hypertrophy. 
Binding sites for MCBF and ARF are present in several genes that are upregulated 
during cardiac hypertrophy. Our results suggest that these factors participate 
in the alterations in gene expression that occur during cardiac development and 
hypertrophy."
8036148,"The question of the origin of the B1 family of rodents is addressed. The modern 
B1 elements are similar to the left Alu monomer, but with a 9 bp deletion and a 
29 bp duplication. Search of databases for B1 elements that do not exhibit those 
modern features revealed sequence fragments that are very similar to the free 
left Alu monomers (FLAMs) described in the primate genomes. In addition, the 
analysis reveals elements that have 10 bp or 7 bp deletion in place of the 9 bp 
deletion but without the 29 bp tandem duplication. The elements described define 
families of proto B1 elements (referred as PB1, PB1D10 and PB1D7) that appeared 
before the first modern B1 element. A phylogenetic reconstruction suggest that 
the origin of Alu and B1 families took place before the divergence between the 
primate and the rodent lineages and that each family has followed different 
evolutionary routes since this radiation."
8039276,"1. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of the 
sympatho-adrenomedullary system to the blood pressure response to an intravenous 
bolus of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in conscious medullectomized and 
sham-operated rats. 2. The peak pressor effect of 0.5 mg TRH was significantly 
increased in rats having no adrenal medulla (+24.2 +/- 1.6 mmHg, mean +/- 
s.e.m., P < 0.01) as compared to sham-operated animals (+12.2 +/- 3.0 mmHg). 3. 
Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine abolished the pressor 
effect of TRH in control rats (+2.1 +/- 1.9 mmHg) but did not attenuate the 
blood pressure response of medullectomized rats (+21.5 +/- 4.7 mmHg). In 
contrast, beta-blockade with propranolol blunted the blood pressure 
responsiveness of rats subjected to adrenal medullectomy (+12.4 +/- 2.6 mmHg) 
but did not modify the effect of TRH in sham-operated controls (+10.9 +/- 2.9 
mmHg). 4. The direct in vitro effect of TRH on isolated mesenteric rat arteries 
was also evaluated. TRH did not induce contractions of isolated arteries. 5. 
These results suggest that in rats with intact adrenals, the pressor effect of 
intravenous TRH is mediated primarily by a stimulation of alpha-adrenergic 
receptors. Adrenal medullectomy appears to enhance the blood pressure response 
to intravenous TRH. Activation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors seems to contribute 
to the blood pressure increasing effect of intravenous TRH in medullectomized 
animals."
8040305,"To investigate the specific contribution of select MHC class II genes on the 
development of murine lupus, H-2 congenic (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice bearing 
either H-2b/b, H-2d/b, or H-2d/d haplotypes were generated. We compared the 
clinical development (autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis) of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in these three F1 hybrids in the presence or 
absence of the mutant gene, Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), 
which normally accelerates the progression of murine SLE. (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid 
female mice bearing either the H-2b/b or H-2d/b haplotype developed a rapid 
course of severe SLE, while the appearance of disease was markedly delayed in 
H-2d/d hybrid females. However, in the presence of the Yaa gene, H-2d/d F1 males 
developed SLE as severe as H-2b/b and H-2d/b F1 males. These data indicate that 
(a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine 
SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype 
exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical 
MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally 
abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice."
8040892,"BACKGROUND: The cumulative cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is thought to result 
from the generation of free radicals. New DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors less 
prone to redox reactions, such as mitoxantrone and more recently the 
anthrapyrazoles, were developed to circumvent this toxicity.
PURPOSE: Two anthrapyrazoles currently in clinical evaluation, DuP 941 
(Losoxantrone) and DuP 937, were compared to other topoisomerase II inhibitors 
with respect to their cytotoxic potency and selectivity and with respect to 
topoisomerase II inhibition.
METHODS: Cytotoxicity was tested in the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer 
Institute preclinical antitumor drug discovery screen (NCI screen). The potency 
of anthrapyrazoles to inhibit purified topoisomerase II was determined. The 
specificity of drug-induced topoisomerase II pattern of cleavage, one of the 
cellular determinants of cytotoxicity, was investigated in human c-myc DNA.
RESULTS: Using the COMPARE analysis, we found that the most closely related 
cytotoxic profiles in the NCI screen were between the anthrapyrazoles and 
mitoxantrone. Among topoisomerase II inhibitors, the cytostatic potency was by 
decreasing order: mitoxantrone; doxorubicin, which was slightly greater than DuP 
941, azatoxin; DuP 937; and amsacrine, which was much greater than VP-16. The 
potency of mitoxantrone and anthrapyrazoles to generate DNA double-strand 
breaks, by induction of the topoisomerase II cleavable complexes in nuclear 
extracts, was in agreement with cytotoxicity. Sequencing of drug-induced 
topoisomerase II cleavages in c-myc DNA showed a common cleavage pattern for 
anthrapyrazoles and mitoxantrone. This pattern was different from the patterns 
obtained with other topoisomerase II inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: At the molecular and cellular levels, anthrapyrazoles are potent 
topoisomerase II inhibitors closely related to mitoxantrone.
IMPLICATIONS: These results validate the COMPARE analysis using the NCI screen 
to predict molecular mechanisms of drug action. Anthrapyrazoles, which are 
unlikely to produce free radicals, might be useful in the same indications as 
mitoxantrone, especially for patients with cardiac risks, for pediatric 
patients, and for patients treated with intensified protocols."

8041527,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the symptom of urinary incontinence 
during athletic endeavors among a group of nulliparous, elite college varsity 
female athletes.
METHODS: All women currently participating in varsity athletics at a large state 
university were asked to fill out a questionnaire about the occurrence of 
urinary incontinence while participating in their sport and during activities of 
daily life. One hundred forty-four of 156 eligible women (92%) responded.
RESULTS: The mean age was 19.9 years, and all women were nulliparous. Overall, 
40 athletes (28%) reported urine loss while participating in their sport. The 
proportions in different sports were: gymnastics 67%, basketball 66%, tennis 
50%, field hockey 42%, track 29%, swimming 10%, volleyball 9%, softball 6%, and 
golf 0%. Two-thirds of the women who noted urine loss during athletics were 
incontinent more often than rarely. There were no statistically significant 
relations between incontinence and amenorrhea, weight, hormonal therapy, or 
duration of athletic activity. Activities most likely to provoke incontinence 
included jumping, high-impact landings, and running. Forty percent and 17% of 
the women first noted incontinence during their sport while in high school and 
junior high school, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence during physical stresses is common in young, highly 
fit, nulliparous women. This suggests that there is a continence threshold 
which, when exceeded, can result in urine loss, even in the absence of known 
risk factors for incontinence."

Chromosomes are normal. Metabolic disorders were excluded. None of 14 well-known

8042708,"Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly 
derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic 
signal) and ""false"" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction 
(homoplasy). However, some types of DNA regions, for example those containing 
tandem duplicate repeats, are preferentially subject to homoplasy-inducing 
processes such as sporadically occurring concerted evolution and DNA 
insertion/deletion. This added level of homoplasic ""noise"" can make DNA regions 
with repeats less reliable in phylogenetic reconstruction than those without 
repeats. Most molecular datasets which distinguish among African hominoids 
support a human-chimpanzee clade; the most notable exception is from the 
involucrin gene. However, phylogenetic resolution supporting a 
chimpanzee-gorilla clade is based entirely on involucrin DNA repeat regions. 
This is problematic because (1) involucrin repeats are difficult to align, and 
published alignments are contradictory; (2) involucrin repeats are subject to 
DNA insertion/deletion; (3) gorillas are polymorphic in that some do not have 
repeats reported to be synapomorphies linking chimpanzees and gorillas. Gene 
tree/species tree conflicts can occur due to the sorting of ancestrally 
polymorphic alleles during speciation. Because hominoid females transfer between 
groups, mitochondrial and nuclear gene flow occur to the same extent, and the 
probability of conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees is 
theoretically low. When hominoid intraspecific mitochondrial variability is 
taken into account [based on cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene 
sequences], humans and chimpanzees are most closely related, showing the same 
relative degree of separation from gorillas as when single individuals 
representing species are analyzed. Conflicting molecular phylogenies can be 
explained in terms of molecular evolutionary processes and sorting of ancient 
polymorphisms. This perspective can enhance our understanding of hominoid 
molecular phylogenies."
8042786,"BACKGROUND: In infants, nonshivering thermogenesis from brown adipose tissue 
provides an important source of heat for thermoregulation. Infants are known to 
have a high susceptibility to hypothermia during anesthesia. To investigate 
whether this could be due to an inhibition of nonshivering thermogenesis by 
anesthetics, the effect of preincubation with volatile anesthetics on the 
norepinephrine-induced heat production of brown adipocytes was investigated.
METHODS: Brown adipocytes from hamsters were isolated with a collagenase 
digestion method and preincubated with volatile anesthetics. The cells were 
stimulated with norepinephrine, and heat production, measured as oxygen 
consumption, was monitored polarographically.
RESULTS: Norepinephrine addition led to a 20-fold increase in the rate of oxygen 
consumption (thermogenesis). However, preincubation of cells with 3% halothane 
reduced the response to norepinephrine by more than 70%. The potency of 
norepinephrine (the median effective concentration) was not affected by 
halothane. Full effect of halothane was reached quickly, and after halothane 
withdrawal, the thermogenic response recovered, although rather slowly. 
Halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane were approximately equipotent inhibitors of 
thermogenesis, with concentrations of approximately 0.7% resulting in 50% 
inhibition. The inhibitory effect of 1% halothane was unaffected by the presence 
of 74% nitrous oxide, but nitrous oxide alone also reduced thermogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Volatile anesthetics severely attenuated the thermogenic response 
to norepinephrine of isolated brown-fat cells. It is inferred that 
brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some 
time after) anesthesia. Because infants are dependent on brown-fat-derived 
nonshivering thermogenesis for thermal balance, the inhibition by volatile 
anesthetic agents of brown-adipocyte heat production may at least partly explain 
the susceptibility of infants to hypothermia during and after anesthesia."
8048706,"Loss of consciousness in childhood may be due to cardiovascular causes, and the 
Long Q-T syndromes can present with seizures. The Romano-Ward syndrome is of 
autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with 
associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis is often 
delayed, but a careful history can avoid this. The syndromes can appear to be 
due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nerve to the ventricular myocardium, and 
precipitating causes such as stress suggest a CNS influence on this. The 
electrocardiogram can confirm the prolonged Q-T interval, but this is not always 
present, at least without an exercise test. Treatment with beta-blockers is 
often successful. If a wrong diagnosis of epilepsy is made a chance may be 
missed of avoiding sudden death, quite apart from all the medical, and social 
consequences that can result from such a diagnosis."
8049444,"A cis-acting DNA regulatory element 3' to the A gamma-globin gene contains eight 
distinct regions of DNA-protein interaction distributed over 750 bp of DNA. The 
sequences of two foot-printed regions (sites I and IV) are A-T rich and generate 
a highly retarded complex on gel shift analysis with nuclear extract from human 
erythroleukemia (K562) cells. We have purified a 98-kD protein that reproduces 
this gel shift. Tryptic cleavage and peptide sequence analysis demonstrated that 
the 98-kD protein is identical to a recently cloned protein, special A-T-rich 
binding protein 1 (SATB1), that binds selectively to nuclear 
matrix/scaffold-associated regions of DNA (MARs/SARs). We have shown by 
functional analysis that the 3' A gamma regulatory element associates with the 
nuclear matrix. SATB1 mRNA was identified in K562 cells, and reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated its transcript in 
several other hematopoietic lines. Antisera to SATB1 caused ablation of the gel 
shift complex generated by both the crude nuclear extract and the purified 98-kD 
protein with the site I oligonucleotide. Furthermore, oligonucleotides that bind 
SATB1 inhibited formation of the site I gel shift complex when added as excess 
unlabeled competitor. An immunoblot analysis of the site I gel shift complex 
documented the presence of SATB1. Binding of SATB1 to two sites within the 3' A 
gamma regulatory element and its MAR/SAR activity suggests that this element may 
influence gene expression through interaction with the nuclear matrix."

8051940,"The mutation N370S accounts for 63% of the mutated glucocerebrosidase alleles of 
Portuguese type 1 Gaucher patients. It has been shown previously that this 
mutation is linked to the Pv1.1- form of the PvuII polymorphism and suggested 
that the N370S mutation in glucocerebrosidase alleles has an Ashkenazi Jewish

is also invariably associated with the Pv1.1- haplotype, despite the fact that 
there is no evidence of Ashkenazi Jewish background in this population."
8052312,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and kinases coregulate the critical 
levels of phosphorylation necessary for intracellular signalling, cell growth 
and differentiation. Yersinia, the causative bacteria of the bubonic plague and 
other enteric diseases, secrete an active PTPase, Yop51, that enters and 
suppresses host immune cells. Though the catalytic domain is only approximately 
20% identical to human PTP1B, the Yersinia PTPase contains all of the invariant 
residues present in eukaryotic PTPases, including the nucleophilic Cys 403 which 
forms a phosphocysteine intermediate during catalysis. We present here 
structures of the unliganded (2.5 A resolution) and tungstate-bound (2.6 A) 
crystal forms which reveal that Cys 403 is positioned at the centre of a 
distinctive phosphate-binding loop. This loop is at the hub of several 
hydrogen-bond arrays that not only stabilize a bound oxyanion, but may activate 
Cys 403 as a reactive thiolate. Binding of tungstate triggers a conformational 
change that traps the oxyanion and swings Asp 356, an important catalytic 
residue, by approximately 6 A into the active site. The same anion-binding loop 
in PTPases is also found in the enzyme rhodanese."
8055935,"The major phosphorylation site for both casein kinase-2 (CK2) and casein 
kinase-1 (CK1) in protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) inhibitor-2 (I-2) is Ser86. Minor 
phosphorylation sites affected by either CK2 or CK1 are Ser120/Ser121 and 
Ser174, respectively. A synthetic peptide of 25 amino acids encompassing 
residues 67-93 of I-2 is phosphorylated by either CK2 or CK1 at its seryl 
residue corresponding to Ser86 with higher Vmax and Km values similar to those 
of the intact protein (9 vs 7.2 microM and 14.2 vs 5.3 microM with CK2 and CK1, 
respectively). No detectable phosphorylation of this peptide which also includes 
the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) site (Thr72), could be observed with 
either GSK-3 or p34cdc2 kinase whether or not its seryl residue equivalent to 
Ser86 had been previously phosphorylated by CK2. Shorter derivatives of 
I-2(67-93), encompassing residues 72-93 and 78-93, are also readily 
phosphorylated by both CK1 and CK2, with phosphorylation efficiencies similar to 
those of the parent peptide. A synthetic heptadecapeptide reproducing the 
phosphoacceptor site around Ser120/Ser121 is phosphorylated by CK2, but not to 
any detectable extent by CK1, with a Km value fivefold higher than that of the 
corresponding pentadecapeptide including Ser86 (78-93). A synthetic 
pentadecapeptide (166-180) reproducing the phosphoacceptor site around Ser174 is 
phosphorylated by CK1 less efficiently than the pentadecapeptide including its 
main phosphorylation site (78-93) (Km 280 microM vs 33 microM). This peptide is 
readily phosphorylated by CK2 as well, although it lacks the canonical consensus 
sequence for CK2 and its Ser174 is almost unaffected by CK2 in intact I-2. These 
data provide the clear-cut demonstration that the consensus sequence with 
N-terminal prephosphorylated residue(s), SerP/ThrP-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr, [Flotow, H., 
Graves, P. R., Wang, A., Fiol, C. J., Roeske, R. W. & Roach, P. J. (1990) J.

Pinna, L. A. (1991) FEBS Lett. 283, 303-306] is not always required to achieve 
efficient and high-affinity phosphorylation by CK1. They also show that the 
specificity determinants for I-2 phosphorylation by either CK2 or CK1, but not 
by GSK3, are entirely grounded on local structural features of the 
phosphoacceptor site, being only marginally affected by the overall structure of 
I-2."
8056902,"A 12-year-old boy was seen in our department with a three year history of 
eruptions on his back consisting of normal colored or slightly reddish, 
pinhead-sized papules, which had gradually spread to his trunk within the 
previous year. Four days before the first visit, May 13, 1992, the eruption 
involved his entire extremities. On the back side of his lumbar region, 
Koebner's phenomenon was observed. He had received several medications for more 
than two years to treat this eruption in several hospitals, but none were 
effective. He was in good general health. Mantoux reaction was negative two 
months after BCG injection. Histopathologic features of the papules included 
focal epidermal hyperplasia and elongation of the rete ridges in a narrow area 
and a well demarcated dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate on the papillar layer. 
Biscoclaurine alkaloids (20 mg/day) and Jumi-haidoku-to (TJ-6; 7.5 g/day) were 
administered to the patient after the biopsy. No topical ointments were applied. 
Two weeks after of these treatments, he reported moderate pruritus on the back. 
The eruption diminished rapidly within 2 weeks after the therapy began. Almost 
all the eruptions were cured within one year. Mantoux reaction developed 8 x 8 
mm erythema two and half months after the treatment began, and it was 
significantly positive (23 x 30 mm) 6 months later."
8058745,"Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking 
agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of 
DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. The function of the recently isolated FACC 
(Fanconi anemia group C complementing) gene for a subset of this disorder is not 
yet known. The notion that FACC plays a direct role in DNA repair would predict 
that the polypeptide should reside in the nucleus. In this study, a polyclonal 
antiserum raised against FACC was used to determine the subcellular location of 
the polypeptide. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies of 
human cell lines as well as COS-7 cells transiently expressing human FACC showed 
that the protein was localized primarily to the cytoplasm under steady-state 
conditions, transit through the cell cycle, and exposure to crosslinking or 
cytotoxic agents. However, placement of a nuclear localization signal from the 
simian virus 40 large tumor antigen at the amino terminus of FACC directed the 
hybrid protein to the nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells. These observations 
suggest an indirect role for FACC in regulating DNA repair in this group of 
Fanconi anemia."
8059339,"A neglected type of neuron, termed the unipolar brush cell, was recently 
characterized in the granular layer of the mammalian cerebellar cortex with 
several procedures, including light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry 
utilizing antibodies to calretinin and neurofilament proteins. Although certain 
features of the unipolar brush cells were highlighted in these studies, the 
internal fine structure was partially obfuscated by immunoreaction product. In 
this study, rat cerebella were prepared for electron microscopy after perfusion 
fixation and Araldite embedding, and folia of the vestibulo-cerebellum, where 
unipolar brush cells are known to be enriched, were studied by light microscopy 
in semithin (0.5-1 micron) sections and by electron microscopy in ultrathin 
sections. Unipolar brush cells were easily identified in semithin sections 
immunostained with antibodies to GABA and/or glycine, and counterstained with 
toluidine blue. The unipolar brush cells have a pale cytoplasm and are GABA and 
glycine negative, while Golgi cells are darker and appear positive for GABA and, 
for the most part, also for glycine. Sets of identification criteria to 
differentiate unipolar brush cells from granule and Golgi cells in standard 
electron micrographs are presented. The unipolar brush cells possess many 
distinctive features that make them easily distinguishable from other cerebellar 
neurons and form unusually conspicuous and elaborate synapses with mossy 
rosettes. The unipolar brush cell has a deeply indented nucleus containing 
little condensed chromatin. The Golgi apparatus is large and the cytoplasm is 
rich in neurofilaments, microtubules, mitochondria, and large dense core 
vesicles, but contains few cisterns of granular endoplasmic reticulum. In 
addition, unipolar brush cells contain an unusual inclusion, which invariably 
lacks a limiting membrane and is made up of peculiar ringlet subunits. The cell 
body usually emits a thin axon and is provided with a single, large dendritic 
trunk that terminates with a paintbrush-like bunch of branchlets. Numerous 
nonsynaptic appendages emanate from the cell body, the dendritic stem, and the 
branchlets. The appendages contain rare organelles and lack neurofilaments. The 
branchlets contain numerous mitochondria, neurofilaments, large dense core 
vesicles, and clusters of clear, small, and round synaptic vesicles. They form 
extensive asymmetric synaptic junctions with one or two mossy fibers, which 
indicates minimal convergence of excitatory inputs. Under the postsynaptic 
densities, the branchlet cytoplasm displays a microfilamentous web. Besides 
their contact with mossy rosettes, the branchlets form symmetric and asymmetric 
synaptic junctions with presumed Golgi cell boutons that contain pleomorphic 
synaptic vesicles, indicating that the unipolar brush cells receive an 
inhibitory modulation. Some of these junctions are unusually extensive.(ABSTRACT

8059835,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that the HELLP (hemolysis, 
elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome is the result of excessive 
vasoconstriction of the hepatic arterial circulation.
STUDY DESIGN: Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the pulsatility index 
of the common hepatic artery in 14 women with preeclampsia, 15 with preeclampsia 
complicated by HELLP syndrome, and 8 with HELLP syndrome but without 
proteinuria. Gestational age ranged from 24 to 38 weeks. The study group was 
compared with a reference group (n = 42).
RESULTS: Both in preeclampsia and in the HELLP syndrome the hepatic artery 
pulsatility index values were significantly increased compared with the 
reference group. However, no significant differences were found between the 
preeclamptic group, the HELLP group with proteinuria, and those with HELLP 
without proteinuria.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that hepatic artery resistance to blood 
flow is increased in preeclampsia in the presence or absence of the HELLP 
syndrome. The results also demonstrate that vasoconstriction of the hepatic 
arteries is not more pronounced in the HELLP syndrome than in other 
manifestations of preeclampsia. Therefore factors other than vasoconstriction 
are likely to be responsible for the development of the HELLP syndrome."
8063775,"We have previously shown that mutations in the GGAA core motif of the Ets1 
binding site, EBSI, or deletion of EBSI, reduced basal and Tax1 transactivation 
of the PTHrP P2 promoter. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to EBSI, a 
CACCC-like motif located between -53 and -58 is required for full basal activity 
of this promoter in Jurkat T-cells. Site-specific mutations in the CACCC motif 
decreased promoter activity approximately 5-fold. In an effort to identify 
transcription factors that bind to the CACCC element, we found that purified 
human Sp1, as well as Sp1 in HeLa nuclear extract, can specifically bind to a 
DNA probe that corresponds to the PTHrP-specific sequence between -94 and -34. 
Gel shift competition studies and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that 
Sp1 specifically interacts with the CACCC motif. In the presence of Ets1, the 
mobility of the Sp1-specific gel shift complex with the PTHrP DNA decreased. 
DNase I footprint analysis of this gel shift complex showed an extended 
footprint over both the Sp1 and the Ets1 binding site, demonstrating that Sp1 
and Ets1 form a ternary complex with the PTHrP DNA. Cotransfection of an Ets1 
and Sp1 expression vector into Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that Sp1 
can functionally cooperate with Ets1 to transactivate the PTHrP promoter. We 
conclude from these data that Ets1 and Sp1 can cooperatively regulate PTHrP P2 
promoter activity."
8065837,"To study the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on vascular permeation 
of albumin in the fetus, ANP (167-600 ng/min) was infused into eight ovine 
fetuses and saline vehicle was infused into eight twin controls (gestational age 
127 +/- 3 d) over a 50-min period. Using two different radiolabeled albumin 
markers, we determined the tissue to blood isotope ratio (TBIR), an index of 
albumin permeation, and the albumin clearance. Although ANP had no hemodynamic 
effect, a marked increase in the hematocrit was observed in ANP-infused fetuses 
compared with initial values (0.37 +/- 0.04 vs 0.42 +/- 0.04, p < 0.005) but was 
unchanged in the twin fetuses receiving saline vehicle (0.35 +/- 0.03 versus

8065896,"The DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (m5C-MTase) M.BspRI is able to accept the 
methyl group from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) in the 
absence of DNA. Transfer of the methyl group to the enzyme is a slow reaction 
relative to DNA methylation. Self-methylation is dependent on the native 
conformation of the enzyme and is inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, DNA 
and sulfhydryl reagents. Amino acid sequencing of proteolytic peptides obtained 
from M.BspRI, which had been methylated with [methyl-3H]AdoMet, and thin layer 
chromatography of the modified amino acid identified two cysteines, Cys156 and 
Cys181 that bind the methyl group in form of S-methylcysteine. One of the 
acceptor residues, Cys156 is the highly conserved cysteine which plays the role 
of the catalytic nucleophile of m5C-MTases."
8068159,"GM1 gangliosidosis is a genetic disease with lysosomal beta-galactosidase 
deficiency caused by mutations of the gene coding for this enzyme. However, 
apparently normal enzyme activity was found in plasma or serum from juvenile GM1 
gangliosidosis patients homozygous for a mutation, R201C (201Arg-->Cys), after 
clotting for 30 min. This extracellular fluid finding is unusual in patients 
with primary and genetic deficiency of beta-galactosidase. The serum enzyme 
activity became relatively low only after 3 1/2-hour clotting because its 
increase in normal controls was not observed in these patients. 
beta-Galactosidase assay is not always reliable, particularly with serum or 
plasma as an enzyme source, for the diagnosis of hereditary beta-galactosidase 
deficiency, unless it is conducted under well-controlled conditions."
8068885,"Clinical syndromes of hormone resistance or independence have baffled clinicians 
for decades. These syndromes sometimes result from mutations or deficiencies in 
enzymes that activate prohormones or from alterations in signal transduction 
proteins. The majority of these conditions, however, arise from abnormalities of 
hormone receptors. We describe examples of syndromes that result from genetic 
mutations or misexpression of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, with a specific 
emphasis on thyroid and androgen resistance syndromes, and estrogen independence 
in breast cancer."
8068955,"We analyzed data from 388 subjects with Fanconi anemia reported to the 
International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). Of those, 332 developed 
hematologic abnormalities at a median age of 7 years (range, birth to 31 years). 
Actuarial risk of developing hematopoietic abnormalities was 98% (95% confidence 
interval, 93% to 99%) by 40 years of age. Common hematologic abnormalities were 
thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. These were often associated with decreased 
bone marrow (BM) cellularity (75% of cases studied). Clonal cytogenetic 
abnormalities developed in 23 of 68 persons with BM failure who had adequate 
studies. Actuarial risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities during BM failure 
was 67% (47% to 87%) by 30 years of age. Fifty-nine subjects developed 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Actuarial 
risk of MDS or AML was 52% (37% to 67%) by 40 years of age. Risk was higher in 
persons with than in those without a prior clonal cytogenetic abnormality (3% 
[0% to 9%] v 35% [0% to 79%]; P = .006). One hundred twenty persons died of 
hematologic causes including BM failure, MDS or AML and treatment related 
complications. Actuarial risk of death from hematologic causes was 81% (67% to 
90%) by 40 years of age."
8069002,"OBJECTIVE: To provide an outline of the drugs and nutritional therapy that could 
contribute to the development of hypophosphatemia in the critically ill patient.
DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary 
literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to 
drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected. 
Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans.
DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case 
reports and clinical trials.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum 
phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an 
effect on phosphate metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder 
recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines, 
beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly 
used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development 
of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished 
individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition 
could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have 
a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely 
to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia."
8070428,"Hypertension is more common in hypothyroidic patients than in euthyroid controls 
in older age groups. Treatment of the thyroid deficiency alone lowers blood 
pressure in most patients. Hemodynamically, cardiac output is reduced and total 
peripheral resistance is elevated. The latter probably is secondary to an 
increase of sympathetic nervous tone and a relative increase in alpha-adrenergic 
response. In hyperthyroidism, elevation of diastolic blood pressure is uncommon. 
Systolic hypertension is more common in younger age groups. Treatment of the 
hyperthyroidism alone lowers systolic blood pressure in most patients. An 
increase in cardiac output and a decrease in total peripheral resistance 
accompany the hyperthyroidism. Potentiation of catecholamine action by an excess 
of thyroid hormone has been invoked as an explanation, because thyroid hormone 
excess is accompanied by increased beta-adrenergic receptors in some tissue, 
including heart."
8075508,"Women with epilepsy giving birth during 1973 to 1991 were identified by record 
linkage of Swedish health registries. Among 3,625 identified infants, 9 had 
spina bifida. A nested case-control study was performed, comparing drugs used in 
early pregnancy in the 9 cases and in 18 controls, matched for year of delivery, 
maternal age, and parity. Six of the spina bifida mothers had used carbamazepine 
and two had used valproic acid. Among the controls, 5 women used carbamazepine 
and one valproic acid. There is an apparent excess risk for spina bifida after 
use of either of these two drugs, but it is not statistically significant when 
the analysis is restricted to drug-using women. The findings support earlier 
reports in the literature of an association between carbamazepine and spina 
bifida."
8077949,"The 605 amino acid E1 protein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) is a 
multifunctional nuclear protein required for viral DNA replication. A nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) sequence was previously defined by point mutations in 
three short adjacent clusters of basic amino acids located in the amino-terminal 
region of the E1 protein. In this study, we used a fusion protein approach to 
evaluate the contribution of other regions of the E1 protein to nuclear 
transport. The nearly full-length E1 gene and six non-overlapping subfragments 
were each fused in-frame with the lacZ gene in a eukaryotic expression vector. 
Each clone was electroporated into COS-1 cells, and the intracellular location 
of the E1-beta-galactosidase fusion proteins was determined by 
immunofluorescence. Only the constructs containing the full-length E1 or a 
single subregion (E1-259; amino acids 84 to 166) produced fusion proteins that 
entered the nucleus. Point mutations in the NLS sequences of the E1-259-lacZ 
construct prevented nuclear translocation of the corresponding fusion protein. 
This confirms the previous result that the cluster of basic amino acids is 
critical for nuclear transport. Furthermore, the data obtained in this 
investigation indicated that the region of E1 containing the NLS sequence was 
not only necessary, but was also sufficient for nuclear localization. No other 
region of E1 contained independent nuclear localization activity."
8078586,"Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000 
live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed 
dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an 
increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, 
suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals 
are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal 
dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In 
contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and 
affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia 
parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 
4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains 
a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is 
expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent 
missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 
protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic 
cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant 
genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that 
recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the 
FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series."
8080508,"Andersen's syndrome is a clinically distinct form of potassium-sensitive 
periodic paralysis associated with cardiac dysrhythmias. The subtle nature of 
the cardiac and dysmorphic features may delay the recognition of this syndrome 
and its potentially lethal cardiac dysrhythmias. The genetic defect in 
Andersen's syndrome is not genetically linked to other forms of 
potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis and is probably distinct from the long QT 
syndrome locus."
8080604,"Kartagener's syndrome is a well known classical triad of presentations 
consisting of bronchiectasis, sinusitis and situs inversus. It is now recognized 
that the syndrome is an extreme presentation of primary ciliary dyskinesia, a 
large group of conditions with ultrastructural ciliary defects, leading to poor 
ciliary motility in various organ systems. A case of Kartagener's syndrome is 
presented in an eight year old Thai boy in whom the ultrastructural ciliary 
defects have been examined and described in detail for the first time in 
Thailand. Incomplete lack of dynein arms was recognized. In addition, 
disorientation of ciliary axis was noticed. Due to severe bronchiectatic changes 
of the right lower lobe and right lingular lobe which did not improve despite 
adequate antibiotics, these lobes were surgically removed. The child has done 
well since, but still suffers occasional and recurrent bouts of sinusitis."
8081035,"The risk of developing a tumor of the nervous system in humans is analysed in 
several studies of populations, exposed to ionising radiation for medical 
reasons, or exposed to military or occupational radiation. The main data come 
from series of patients who underwent radiotherapy during childhood: a high 
incidence of tumors of the nervous system is found after irradiation of one to a 
few grays as treatment of a benign disease (especially tinea capitis), as well 
as after irradiation at higher doses of a few tens of grays for the treatment of 
cancer (in particular cerebral irradiation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia). 
The type of radiation-induced tumors is variable, but meningioma is more 
frequent after low doses and glioma and sarcoma after higher doses used in the 
treatment of neoplastic diseases. A dose-effect relationship appeared between 
the risk of tumor of the nervous system and the radiation dose. The risk was 
higher when radiation was delivered at a younger age. Much less data are 
available after radiotherapy in the adulthood, but an increased risk of cerebral 
tumor appears in the series of ankylosing spondylitis patients. As for the 
exposures to radiodiagnosis exams, the main problem is the risk of cerebral 
tumor in children whose mother has undergone abdominal or pelvic X-rays during 
pregnancy. No risk of neurologic tumor was found in the A-bomb survivors 
irradiated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Occupational exposure to ionising 
radiation has been incriminated in the first radiologists exposed to high doses. 
In nuclear industry workers, the results of epidemiological studies are 
contradictory and at the present time it is not possible to link their 
radiologic exposure with a risk of tumor of the nervous system. In populations 
living near nuclear plants, mortality due to tumors of the nervous system was 
not increased."
8086335,"The amino terminus of the avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29 v-Myc oncoprotein 
contains sequences that are essential for cellular transformation (S. Farina, et 
al. J. Virol., 66: 2698-2708, 1992; S. Min and E. J. Taparowsky. Oncogene, 
7:1531-1540, 1992) and for the ability to activate gene transcription (S. Min 
and E. J. Taparowsky. Oncogene, 7:1531-1540, 1992). To investigate the molecular 
interactions that mediate these v-Myc-associated activities, we performed 
competition assays in which various regions of the v-Myc amino terminal 
transcription activation domain (TAD) were examined for their ability to inhibit 
transcription activation by v-Myc, VP16, and the myogenic regulatory factor 
MyoD. Overexpression of these transcriptional activators also was used to 
investigate whether Myc-interacting proteins were required for cellular 
transformation and cell proliferation events. Our results demonstrate that at 
least two distinct cellular activities interact with the v-Myc TAD and that it 
is the synergism between these activities that is required for v-Myc to function 
fully as a transcriptional activator. In addition, v-Myc activators squelch 
VP16- and MyoD-dependent transcription activation, suggesting that the v-Myc TAD 
interacts with a component of the general transcription machinery. In support of 
this observation, we found that overexpression of the v-Myc TAD inhibits 
ras-mediated cellular transformation as well as cell proliferation, underscoring 
the critical role these amino terminal Myc-interacting factors play in 
regulating the physiology of both normal and transformed cells."
8127448,"We report on a 12-year-old patient with Turcot Syndrome (Glioma polyposis). This 
patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic 
glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis

of this rare syndrome, such as the young age of the patient and the relatively 
long survival time, will be discussed."
8128314,"In housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a 
so-called CpG island. We have compared the available human and mouse DNA 
sequences with respect to their CpG island properties. While mouse sequences 
showed a simple gradient distribution of G + C content and CpG densities, man 
had a distinct peak of sequences with typical CpG island characteristics. 
Pairwise comparison of 23 orthologous genes revealed that mouse almost always 
had a less pronounced CpG island than man, or none at all. In both species the 
requirements for a functional CpG island may be similar in that most DNA regions 
with a density of six or more CpG per 100 bp remain unmethylated. However, the 
mouse has apparently experienced more accidental CpG island methylation, 
suggested by local TpG and CpA excess. We propose that: (1) in mouse the CpG 
islands do not represent the ancestral state but have been eroded during 
evolution, and (2) this erosion may be related to the mouse's small body mass 
and short life-span, allowing for a more relaxed control of gene activity."
8129414,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic disease with 
prominent cutaneous and brain involvement whose clinical and molecular genetics 
are reviewed.
OBSERVATIONS: Tuberous sclerosis is a systemic disorder (incidence one in 
10,000) characterized by benign growths (hamartias and hamartomas) in multiple 
organ systems. Involvement of the brain can result in persistent seizures and 
mental retardation; skin involvement includes facial angiofibromas, subungual 
fibromas, hypomelanotic macules, forehead fibrous plaques, and Shagreen's 
patches. Approximately 60% of TS occurs as apparent sporadic cases. In families, 
it has autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance (approximately 95%), 
with careful clinical and radiologic evaluation. Genetic linkage analysis 
indicates that about half of all TS families show linkage to chromosome 9q34, 
and about half to chromosome 16p13. There are no distinguishing features in the 
two groups of families showing linkage to the two genomic regions, nor strong 
evidence for a third causative gene. Positional cloning efforts for both 
chromosomal regions have limited the region containing the gene to about 1 to 2 
million bases.
CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the two TS genes should illuminate the 
pathogenesis of TS and provide opportunities for genetic counseling, prenatal 
diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention."
8131775,"We report two observations of significant left heart involvement in patients 
with the carcinoid syndrome assessed by transthoracic and transoesophageal 
echocardiography. Echocardiographic lesions of this kind have only been reported 
twice. In the present cases, there was mitral involvement with mitral 
regurgitation in one case and a mitro-aortic involvement with mitral and aortic 
regurgitation in the other. The mechanism of left heart lesions is unclear since 
in both cases no right-to-left cardiac shunt was present, as attested by colour 
Doppler and saline contrast transoesophageal echocardiography. The location of 
the primary tumour was unknown in one case and ileal in the other; no pulmonary 
metastasis was detected. The use of transoesophageal echocardiography might make 
it possible to detect left-sided cardiac lesions more frequently since they were 
found in anatomical series, in 30% of patients with carcinoid syndrome."
8133999,"The authors observed one case of an iatrogenic subarachnoid-pleural fistula 
secondary to the resection of an upper lobe carcinoma of the lung. The clinical 
presentation was characterized by a sudden deterioration of mental status and 
level of consciousness immediately after the removal of the thoracotomy chest 
tube. The diagnosis was substantiated by the demonstration of pneumocephalus by 
a computed tomographic scan of the head and by the identification of a left T5 
nerve root fistula by a postmyelographic computed tomographic scan. The 
excellent anatomical definition achieved by this modality emphasizes its 
usefulness in the identification and therapeutic management of these lesions. 
Operative treatment consisted of the suture ligature of the nerve root and a 
chest drain. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the outcome was 
excellent, with the only finding of sensory loss in the T5 nerve root territory. 
A review of the literature disclosed 11 similar cases, with some differences in 
the choice of the most appropriate diagnostic procedure and significant 
differences in the therapeutic options, which were related to the various 
mechanisms of injury."
8136666,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of gamolenic acid provided by evening 
primrose oil in treating hot flushes and sweating associated with the menopause.
DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study.
SETTING: District general hospital and teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS: 56 menopausal women suffering hot flushes at least three times a day.
INTERVENTION: Four capsules twice a day of 500 mg evening primrose oil with 10 
mg natural vitamin E or 500 mg liquid paraffin for six months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the number of hot flushes or sweating episodes 
a month.
RESULTS: 56 diaries were analysed, 28 from women taking gamolenic acid and 28 
from those taking placebo. Only 18 women given gamolenic acid and 17 given 
placebo completed the trial. The mean (SE) improvement in the number of flushes 
in the last available treatment cycle compared with the control cycle was 1.9 
(0.4) (P < 0.001) for daytime flushes and 0.7 (0.3) (P < 0.05) for night time 
flushes in women taking placebo; the corresponding values for women taking 
gamolenic acid were 0.5 (0.4) and 0.5 (0.3). In women taking gamolenic acid the 
only significant improvement was a reduction in the maximum number of night time 
flushes (1.4 (0.6); P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Gamolenic acid offers no benefit over placebo in treating menopausal 
flushing."
8139084,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the hepatic effects of tacrine treatment in patients 
with Alzheimer's disease.
DESIGN: Controlled trials of tacrine therapy consisting of two blinded, 
parallel-group trials; three blinded, enrichment-design trials; and their 
respective open-label extensions.
SETTING: Multicenter clinical trials in the United States, France, and Canada.
PATIENTS: A total of 2446 men and women at least 50 years of age with a 
diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity and in 
good health without significant hepatic, cardiovascular, or renal disease.
INTERVENTION: Administration of tacrine vs placebo, with weekly measurement of 
serum hepatic enzymes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, maximum severity, and timing of event for 
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation.
RESULTS: Among the 2446 patients who received tacrine in clinical trials, ALT 
levels greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred on at least one 
occasion in 1203 patients (49%), ALT levels greater than three times the ULN 
occurred in 621 patients (25%), and ALT levels greater than 20 times the ULN 
occurred in 40 patients (2%). The elevated ALT levels were generally 
asymptomatic and occurred more frequently in women than men. The mean time from 
initiation of tacrine treatment to first ALT level greater than three times the 
ULN was 50 days, and 90% of all initial ALT levels greater than three times the 
ULN occurred during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Of 145 patients who 
discontinued tacrine treatment because of an ALT level greater than three times 
the ULN and were rechallenged, 127 (88%) were able to resume long-term therapy 
with the drug. In all instances, discontinuing tacrine completely reversed 
elevations in ALT levels, and no deaths related to hepatotoxicity occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the potential for serious hepatic toxicity 
can be reduced through careful monitoring of ALT levels in patients who may 
benefit from tacrine therapy."
8142051,"Though echogenic fetal bowel has been associated with meconium ileus and/or 
peritonitis, it may be a normal finding in the second trimester. The purpose of 
this study is to determine which characteristics might distinguish fetuses 
ultimately having abnormal outcomes in a population at low risk for cystic 
fibrosis. Seven fetuses with echogenic bowel were identified: 5 fetuses < or = 
20 weeks gestation (group 1) and 2 fetuses 20-25 weeks gestation (group 2) at 
diagnosis. Four of 5 group 1 fetuses had resolution of the echogenic bowel 
during the second trimester. One group 2 fetus had a persistent mass associated 
with growth deficiency and trisomy 18. The neonatal bowel evaluation was normal 
in the remaining 2 fetuses although echogenic findings persisted into the third 
trimester. In a low-risk population, echogenic bowel usually resolves without 
neonatal sequelae. Even when persistent into the third trimester, echogenic 
bowel does not uniformly herald an abnormal outcome. Echogenic bowel coexistent 
with other abnormalities (such as growth deficiency or structural malformations) 
may be a comarker for aneuploidy."
8143741,"The distribution of cardiolipin across the inner mitochondrial membrane was 
directly determined by using the ability of the fluorescent dye 
10-N-nonyl-3,6-bis(dimethylamino)acridine (10-N-nonyl acridine orange) to form 
dimers when it interacts with the diacidic phospholipid. Two independent methods 
were employed: (a) a spectrophotometric measurement of 10-N-nonyl acridine 
orange binding to isolated rat liver mitochondria, mitoplasts and inside-out 
submitochondrial particles, and (b) a flow-cytometric analysis of specific red 
fluorescence, emitted when two dye molecules are bound to one membrane 
cardiolipin; the stoichiometry of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange binding to 
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, 1 mol dye/mol phospholipid, 
prevented dye dimerisation and subsequent red-fluorescence appearance. 57% total 
cardiolipin was present in the outer leaflets of inner membranes of isolated 
organelles, a distribution confirmed by saturation measurements for mitoplasts 
and inside-out submitochondrial particles. The same asymmetry was directly 
observed in situ with mitochondrial membranes of quiescent L1210 cells, and with 
mitochondrial membranes of respiring yeasts. Nevertheless, alterations in ATP 
synthesis and inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis revealed that 
cardiolipin distribution was apparently tightly correlated with mitochondrial 
membrane assembly and activity."
8144024,"RNA secondary structure is a critical determinant of RNA function in ribosome 
assembly, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA translation and RNA stability. The 'DEAD/H' 
family of putative RNA helicases may help regulate these processes by utilizing 
intrinsic RNA-dependent ATPase activity to catalyze conformational changes in 
RNA secondary structure. To investigate the repertoire of DEAD/H box proteins 
expressed in mammals, we used PCR techniques to clone from mouse erythroleukemia 
(MEL) cells three new DEAD box cDNAs with high similarity to known yeast 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes. mDEAD2 and mDEAD3 (mouse DEAD box proteins) 
are > 95% identical to mouse PL10 but exhibit differential tissue-specific 
expression patterns; mDEAD2 and mDEAD3 are also approx. 70% identical (at the aa 
level) to yeast DED1 and DBP1 proteins. Members of this DEAD box subclass 
contain C-terminal domains with high content of Arg, Ser, Gly and Phe, 
reminiscent of the RS domain in several Drosophila and mammalian splicing 
factors. mDEAD5 belongs to a second class related to translation initiation 
factors from yeast (TIF1/TIF2) and mammals (eIF-4A); this class contains a novel 
conserved peptide motif not found in other DEAD box proteins. Northern blotting 
shows that mDEAD5 is differentially expressed in testis vs. somatic tissues. 
Thus, mouse erythroid cells produce two highly conserved families of putative 
RNA helicases likely to play important roles in RNA metabolism and gene 
expression."
8144827,"OBJECTIVE: To compare communication in triadic (three-person) and dyadic 
(two-person) older patient medical interviews and to determine the influence of 
the presence of a third person on the physician-older patient relationship.
DESIGN: Matched sample of dyadic and triadic audiotaped outpatient medical 
visits. Audiotapes were coded with the Multi-dimensional Interaction Analysis 
(MDIA) system.
SETTING: Hospital-based medical primary care group practice in a major urban 
teaching institution.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients 60 years and older who were making their first visit to 
study physicians. In a sample of 96 audiotaped initial medical visits, 15 
encounters involved three persons. These 15 cases were matched with 15 dyadic 
interviews for gender and race of the patient and for gender and race of the 
physician.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Content, interactional processes, and specific language 
and communication behaviors of older patients, physicians, and third persons in 
the medical encounter, as measured by the MDIA system.
RESULTS: The specific content and the quality of interactional processes of 
physicians were not affected by the presence of a third person. However, older 
patients raised fewer topics in all content areas (medical, personal habits, 
psychosocial, and physician-patient relationship) in triads than in dyads. 
Overall, patients were less responsive (ie, the quality of their questioning, 
informing, and supportiveness was poorer) on patient-raised topics in triads 
than in dyads. Patients were rated as less assertive and expressive, and there 
was less joint decision-making and shared laughter in triads than in dyads. 
Patients were frequently excluded from conversations in visits in which a third 
person was present.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a third person in the medical encounter changes the 
interactional dynamics of older patient medical interviews and may influence the 
development of a trusting and effective physician-older patient relationship."
8145639,"Killer toxins are polypeptides secreted by some fungal species that kill 
sensitive cells of the same or related species. In the best-characterized cases, 
they function by creating new pores in the cell membrane and disrupting ion 
fluxes. Immunity or resistance to the toxins is conferred by the preprotoxins 
(or products thereof) or by nuclear resistance genes. In several cases, the 
toxins are encoded by one or more genomic segments of resident double-stranded 
RNA viruses. The known toxins are composed of one to three polypeptides, usually 
present as multimers. We have further characterized the KP4 killer toxin from 
the maize smut fungus Ustilago maydis. This toxin is also encoded by a single 
viral double-stranded RNA but differs from other known killer toxins in several 
respects: it has no N-linked glycosylation either in the precursor or in the 
mature polypeptide, it is the first killer toxin demonstrated to be a single 
polypeptide, and it is not processed by any of the known secretory proteinases 
(other than the signal peptidase). It is efficiently expressed in a heterologous 
fungal system."

8149754,"The association between recent atrial fibrillation during the course of acute 
myocardial infarction and pericarditis or pericardial effusion occurring during 
the hospital phase of myocardial infarction was studied by means of serial 
echocardiographic examinations in 192 patients presenting with their first 
myocardial infarction. Clinical pericarditis was found in 8%, echocardiographic 
effusion in 43%, and atrial fibrillation in 5% of all patients. Atrial 
fibrillation was present in only 2% of patients without pericardial effusion 
compared to 15% of patients with more than minimal effusion (p = 0.0094). Thus, 
pericarditis might play a role in the development of recent atrial fibrillation 
during the course of myocardial infarction. Recent atrial fibrillation may be a 
sign of pericardial effusion which may be otherwise silent."

polarized cells and is also required to establish segments in the embryo. Here, 
we show that loss of dishevelled function in clones, in double heterozygotes 
with wingless mutants and in flies bearing a weak dishevelled transgene leads to 
patterning defects which phenocopy defects observed in wingless mutants alone. 
Further, polarized cells in all body segments require dishevelled function to 
establish planar cell polarity, and some wingless alleles and dishevelled; 
wingless double heterozygotes exhibit bristle polarity defects identical to 
those seen in dishevelled alone. The requirement for dishevelled in establishing 
polarity in cell autonomous. The dishevelled gene encodes a novel intracellular 
protein that shares an amino acid motif with several other proteins that are 
found associated with cell junctions. Clonal analysis of dishevelled in leg 
discs provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that the wingless 
dishevelled interaction species at least one of the circumferential positional 
values predicted by the polar coordinate model. We propose that dishevelled 
encodes an intracellular protein required to respond to a wingless signal and 
that this interaction is essential for establishing both cell polarity and cell 
identity."
8149916,"The daughterless (da) gene in Drosophila encodes a broadly expressed 
transcriptional regulator whose specific functions in the control of sex 
determination and neurogenesis have been extensively examined. We describe here 
a third major developmental role for this regulatory gene: follicle formation 
during oogenesis. A survey of da RNA and protein distribution during oogenesis 
reveals a multiphasic expression pattern that includes both germline and soma. 
Whereas the germline expression reflects da's role in progeny sex determination, 
the somatic ovary expression of da correlates with the gene's role during egg 
chamber morphogenesis. Severe, but viable, hypomorphic da mutant genotypes 
exhibit dramatic defects during oogenesis, including aberrantly defined 
follicles and loss of interfollicular stalks. The follicular defects observed in 
da mutant ovaries are qualitatively very similar to those described in Notch (N) 
or Delta (Dl) mutant ovaries. Moreover, in the ovary da- alleles exhibit 
dominant synergistic interactions with N or Dl mutations. We propose that all 
three of these genes function in the same regulatory pathway to control follicle 
formation."
8151646,"A case of mosaic Turner's syndrome with a 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX karyotype, who was 
also a fragile X obligate carrier as the mother of an affected boy, was 
identified by molecular diagnosis. Complete haplotyping and direct DNA analysis 
showed that the X chromosome in all metaphases was the normal X. At the age of 
57, she is mentally normal. Her external appearance was typical of Turner's 
syndrome. This report shows that molecular studies in conjunction with 
cytogenetic analysis can help in the clinical diagnosis of a rare case and can 
show the uniqueness of a case such as the one here described."
8152255,"We used fluorescence DNA in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect chromosomal 
abnormalities as an indicator of minimal residual disease in follow-up samples 
from the bone marrow (BM), or peripheral blood, of 25 patients with leukemia, 
lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Trisomies were detected by interphase 
FISH with repeat-sequence probes (RSP) or by using metaphase FISH with 
whole-chromosome paint probes (WCP). Specific translocations were detected using 
WCP probes. Translocations were observed using metaphase FISH in two patients in 
uncertain or complete remission (CR), who both later suffered relapse. Five 
patients with no abnormal cells remained in CR. Four patients with trisomies 
detected during CR suffered relapse; metaphase FISH detected the trisomy in 
0.17-16% of metaphase cells. Five patients for whom the trisomy occurred in 
0.034% of cells remained in CR. Trisomic nuclei were observed in 0.27-2.3% of 
interphase cells, by means of RSPs, in four patients who later suffered relapse. 
Five patients with trisomic nuclei in 0.061% remained in CR. When two probes 
were used simultaneously in a sample from one patient, 1% of the residual cells 
were abnormal. The patient later suffered relapse. In one patient with 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, CD30-positive interphase cells were shown to 
have trisomic chromosome 7 by immunophenotyping and FISH. Our results suggest 
that metaphase FISH using WCP probes is a sensitive and specific method for 
detecting minimal residual disease especially in patients with translocations."
8152424,"We have previously reported the isolation of an Escherichia coli K12 mutant that 
is extremely sensitive to mutagenesis by low doses of ethylating agents. We now 
show by Southern analysis that the mutation involves a gross deletion covering 
at least the ogt and fnr genes and that no O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase 
activity is present in cell-free extracts of an ada::Tn10 derivative of these 
bacteria. Confirmation that sensitisation to ethylation-induced mutagenesis was 
attributable to ogt and not to any other loci covered by the deletion was 
obtained by constructing derivatives. Thus an ogt::kanr disruption mutation was 
introduced into the parental ogt+ bacteria, and the ogt::kanr mutation was then 
eliminated by cotransduction of ogt+ with the closely linked Tetr marker 
(zcj::Tn10). The delta(ogt-fnr) deletion or ogt::kanr disruption mutants were 
highly sensitive to ethyl methanesulphonate-induced mutagenesis, as measured by 
the induction of forward mutations to L-arabinose resistance (Arar). 
Furthermore, the number of Arar mutants increased linearly with dose, unlike the 
case in ogt+ bacteria, which had a threshold dose below which no mutants 
accumulated. Differences in mutability were even greater with propyl 
methanesulphonate. Overproduction of the ogt alkyltransferase from a multicopy 
plasmid reduced ethylmethanesulphonate-induced mutagenesis in the ogt- mutant 
strains and also methylmethanesulphonate mutagenesis in ada- bacteria. A sample 
of AB1157 obtained from the E. coli K12 genetic stock centre also had a deletion 
covering the ogt and fnr genes. Since such deletions greatly influence the 
mutagenic responses to alkylating agents, a survey of the presence of the ogt 
gene in the E. coli K12 strain being used is advisable."
8152926,"Using the 1kb 3' terminal DNA fragment of the mouse methyltransferase cDNA as a 
probe and low stringent hybridisation conditions, a new potential 
methyltransferase (MTase) gene family was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana 
genomic DNA library. One clone (MTase-11), which gave the strongest signal at 
the Northern blot, was entirely sequenced (11483 bp) and further characterised. 
Under consideration of the likely open reading frames and our preliminary cDNA 
experiments we propose that the clone 11 gene encodes for an approximately 90 kD 
protein. As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved 
sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases. MTase-11 gene expression 
was demonstrable in callus and during germination but not in one month old 
plants or in leaves."
8153497,"Skeletal muscle tissue is sensitive to the acute and chronic stresses associated 
with resistance training. These responses are influenced by the structure of 
resistance activity (i.e. frequency, load and recovery) as well as the training 
history of the individuals involved. There are histochemical and biochemical 
data which suggest that resistance training alters the expression of myosin 
heavy chains (MHCs). Specifically, chronic exposure to bodybuilding and power 
lifting type activity produces shifts towards the MHC I and IIb isoforms, 
respectively. However, it is not yet clear which training parameters trigger 
these differential expressions of MHC isoforms. Interestingly, many programmes 
undertaken by athletes appear to cause a shift towards the MHC I isoform. 
Increments in the cross-sectional area of muscle after resistance training can 
be primarily attributed to fibre hypertrophy. However, there may be an upper 
limit to this hypertrophy. Furthermore, significant fibre hypertrophy appears to 
follow the sequence of fast twitch fibre hypertrophy preceding slow twitch fibre 
hypertrophy. Whilst some indirect measures of fibre number in living humans 
suggest that there is no interindividual variation, postmortem evidence suggests 
that there is. There are also animal data arising from investigations using 
resistance training protocols which suggest that chronic exercise can increase 
fibre number. Furthermore, satellite cell activity has been linked to myotube 
formation in the human. However, other animal models (i.e. compensatory 
hypertrophy) do not support the notion of fibre hyperplasia. Even if hyperplasia 
does occur, its effect on the cross-sectional area of muscle appears to be 
small. Phosphagen and glycogen metabolism, whilst important during resistance 
activity appear not to normally limit the performance of resistance activity. 
Phosphagen and related enzyme adaptations are affected by the type, structure 
and duration of resistance training. Whilst endogenous glycogen reserves may be 
increased with prolonged training, typical isotonic training for less than 6 
months does not seem to increase glycolytic enzyme activity. Lipid metabolism 
may be of some significance in bodybuilding type activity. Thus, not 
surprisingly, oxidative enzyme adaptations appear to be affected by the 
structure and perhaps the modality of resistance training. The dilution of 
mitochondrial volume and endogenous lipid densities appears mainly because of 
fibre hypertrophy."

8154510,"PURPOSE: To develop a strategy to identify cases of endogenous subclinical 
hyperthyroidism and free triiodothyronine (free T3) thyrotoxicosis in otherwise 
healthy ambulatory patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the records of 
ambulatory patients who had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels determined 
between October 1, 1991 and August 31, 1992. Each patient also had a 
simultaneous free thyroxine (free T4) measurement. Patients were excluded from 
consideration if they had active, concurrent non-thyroidal illness, psychiatric 
disease, known hypothalamic/pituitary lesions, were under treatment for hyper- 
or hypothyroidism, were on drugs known to affect TSH levels, or were pregnant. 
Patients without exclusions were diagnosed with free T3 toxicosis if they had: 
(1) a markedly subnormal TSH level (less than or equal to 0.1 mU/L), (2) a 
normal free T4, (3) a normal total T3, (4) evidence of a primary thyroid 
abnormality (e.g., autonomous function on a thyroid scan), and (5) an elevated 
free T3 level by tracer equilibrium dialysis. Patients meeting conditions 1-4, 
but with normal free T3 levels, were considered to have subclinical 
hyperthyroidism.
RESULTS: One thousand twenty-five patients had TSH and simultaneous free T4 
determinations, and 148 of these had markedly subnormal TSH but normal free T4 
levels. Three patients met the criteria for free T3 toxicosis and three had 
subclinical hyperthyroidism. All six patients had either multinodular glands or 
a single nodule on thyroid exam. Four patients were treated with radioactive 
iodine or surgery, resulting in reversal of the TSH suppression in three cases.
CONCLUSION: Apparently healthy ambulatory patients with subnormal TSH levels 
should be worked up with measurements of free T4 and total T3. If these are 
normal, a T3 level (by tracer equilibrium dialysis) be obtained to distinguish 
subclinical hyperthyroidism from overt free T3 toxicosis. A thyroid scan and 
radioiodine uptake measurement can be obtained to substantiate the diagnosis. 
Some patients with these conditions will benefit from treatment."
8158611,"Arboviruses differ from other viruses in their need to replicate in both 
vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The invertebrate is a blood-sucking arthropod 
that is competent to transmit the virus between susceptible animals. Arboviruses 
transmitted by ticks must adapt to the peculiar physiological and behavioral 
characteristics of ticks, particularly with regard to blood feeding, bloodmeal 
digestion, and molting. Virus imbibed with the blood meal first infects cells of 
the midgut wall. During this phase the virus must contend with the heterophagic 
bloodmeal digestion of ticks (an intracellular process occurring within midgut 
cells) and overcome the as yet undefined ""gut barrier"" to infection. Genetic and 
molecular data for a number of tick-borne viruses indicate ways in which such 
viruses may have adapted to infecting ticks, but far more information is needed. 
After infection of midgut cells, tick-borne viruses pass to the salivary glands 
for transmission during the next blood-feeding episode. To do this, the virus 
must survive molting by establishing an infection in at least one cell type that 
does not undergo histolysis. Different tick-borne viruses have different 
strategies for surviving the molting period, targeting a variety of tick 
tissues. The infection can then persist for the life span of the tick with 
little evidence of any detrimental effects on the tick. Transmission to a 
vertebrate host during feeding most probably occurs via saliva that contains 
virus secreted from infected salivary gland cells. The virus then enters the 
skin site of feeding, which has been profoundly modified by the pharmacological 
effects of tick saliva. At least three tick-borne viruses exploit such 
tick-induced host changes. This phenomenon (saliva-activated transmission) is 
believed to underlie ""nonviremic transmission,"" whereby a virus is transmitted 
from an infected to an uninfected cofeeding tick through a host that has an 
undetectable or very low viremia. Thus tick-borne viruses that have adapted to 
the feeding characteristics of their tick vectors may not need to induce a 
virulent infection (with high viremia) in their natural vertebrate hosts. 
Efficient transmission of tick-borne viruses between cofeeding ticks may be a 
means of amplifying virus infection prevalence in F1 generations infected by 
transovarial transmission."
8159911,"While the knowledge concerning the role of the immune system in many internal 
disorders has grown rapidly in recent years, there are few methods to assess 
immune system activation in clinical practice. Measurement of urine neopterin, 
product of a metabolic pathway controlled by interferon-gamma, has been found 
useful in many clinical conditions. The present study concerns neopterin 
excretion in 157 patients with different internal disorders. As expected, we 
found an increase in urine neopterin in patients with malignant tumors, 
autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus or inflammatory bowel 
disease, and infections. Elevated neopterin levels were also observed in acute 
pancreatitis and in acute myocardial infarction. In addition, significant 
correlations between urine neopterin and zinc and neopterin and copper excretion 
were found suggesting a physiological role of neopterin as urine antioxidant."
8160653,"To evaluate chronic effects of acute organophosphate pesticide poisoning, 
quantitatively determined vibrotactile thresholds were measured as an index of 
peripheral neuropathy among agricultural workers in Nicaragua. Thirty-six male 
workers were evaluated between 10 and 34 months after hospitalization for acute 
organophosphate poisoning and compared to an age- and sex-matched community 
reference group. Vibrotactile thresholds were measured quantitatively in right 
and left index fingers and right and left great toes. Study subjects were 
stratified into three groups: 1) never poisoned; 2) poisoned with 
organophosphates other than methamidophos, agents which have not been reported 
to cause peripheral neuropathy; and 3) poisoned with methamidophos, a peripheral 
neurotoxin. For all digits, there was a statistically significant trend of 
increasing age- and height-adjusted thresholds across these three exposure 
categories. Over one fourth of patients previously poisoned with methamidophos 
we studied had abnormal vibrotactile thresholds. These results suggest that 
previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may 
represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of 
exposure that may be much more common than previously thought."

8162086,"Several laboratory tests have been proposed for the differentiation of beta 
thalassemia from iron deficiency, including decision functions based on red 
blood cells indices generated by electronic cell counters. The accuracy of these 
screening methods was assessed in 192 patients with microcytosis known to be 
secondary to beta thalassemia minor and 72 patients with iron deficiency. The 
functions evaluated were: 1) discriminant function of England an Fraser: 
MCV--(5xHb)--RBC--8.4; 2) ratio of MCH/RBC; 3) ratio of MCV/RBC; 4) ratio of 
(MCV)2 x MCH and 5) the erythrocyte count. The discriminant function of England 
and Fraser showed the highs, percentage of correct distinction between iron 
deficiency and beta thalassemia minor, although diagnosis errors occurred in 
10%. Mentzer ratio MCV/RBC detected all cases of beta thalassemia but was a poor 
index for iron deficiency detection. The tested discriminant function, with 
exception of the Mentzer ratio, although not sufficiently accurate for 
definitive diagnosis, appears to be a useful technique in the initial screening 
of patients with microcytosis."

meningioma but ossification of the meningeal tumor was rarely observed. Two 
cases of ossificated spinal cord meningiomas, located extramedullary 
intradurally apart from spinal bone, were clinicopathologically analyzed. The 
patients were 75-year-old female with meningioma at T9-10 level and 60-year-old 
female with one at T6-8 level. With pathological examination, concentration of 
psammoma bodies is not related to the formation of bone tissue. Metaplasia of

8164014,"The sensitivities and predictive values of visual, somatosensory, and brain 
auditory evoked potentials (EPs), cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal banding 
(CSF-OB) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were evaluated for the early 
diagnosis of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). Paraclinical 
evidence of asymptomatic lesions allows a diagnosis of CDMS. Eighty-two patients 
in whom MS was suspected but diagnosis of CDMS was not possible entered the 
study prospectively. Paraclinical examinations were performed at entry. Patients 
were examined and underwent EPs every 6 months, and MRI yearly. After a mean 
follow-up of 2.9 years, 28 patients (34%) had developed CDMS (McDonald-Halliday 
criteria). The initial MRI was strongly suggestive of MS in 19 of these (68%), 
while 27 (96%) had at least one MS-like abnormality in the initial MRI. CSF-OB 
and EPs had lower sensitivities. CDMS developed during follow-up in 19 of the 36 
patients (53%) who had an initial MRI strongly suggestive of MS but in only 1 of 
the 25 who had normal MRI when first studied. These results support previous 
conclusions that MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting white matter 
asymptomatic lesions, and the most predictive for the diagnosis of CDMS."
8164066,"Hypercholesterolemia attributable to increased plasma concentrations of low 
density lipoproteins is a well recognized risk factor for the premature 
development of coronary atherosclerosis in both experimental animals and humans. 
Recent studies have indicated that modifications to low density lipoprotein 
result in enhanced uptake of the modified lipoproteins by macrophages and lead 
to accelerated rates of lipid deposition and the creation of foam cells. 
Oxidation of low density lipoprotein has been shown to be one of the 
modifications which leads to uptake of this lipoprotein by scavenger receptors 
present on macrophages and results in intracellular lipid accumulation. 
Treatment of hypercholesterolemic animals with antioxidant drugs, including 
probucol, has been shown to reduce the development of atherosclerosis and 
xanthoma regression has been observed in patients with severe 
hypercholesterolemia treated with this drug. Epidemiologic studies support the 
view that low plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E 
are associated with higher rates of coronary atherosclerosis in humans and that 
supplementation with vitamin E is associated with a decreased incidence of 
coronary artery disease. Prospective clinical trials to assess the potential 
benefit of antioxidant supplementation in high risk patients are currently in 
progress and these trials, when completed, should provide definitive information 
concerning the potential benefits to be derived from supplementation with 
antioxidant vitamins as an adjunctive therapy to prevent the premature 
development of atherosclerosis."
8164540,"Recently, Sarna et al. (Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 25:237-244, 1993) reported 
increased mean life expectancy in former world class athletes. Because lifestyle 
is associated with longevity, we have examined whether health habits of former 
Finnish male athletes (N = 1274; present mean age: 57.5, range: 36-94 yr) 
differed from those of noncompetitive referents (N = 788; mean age: 55.7, range: 
39-87 yr). The athletes had represented Finland in international competitions in 
endurance (N = 177), power (N = 454), or other (""mixed"") events (N = 643) from 
1920-1965. Data on physical characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and 
health habits were obtained from questionnaires. All dependent variables in an 
analysis of covariance and in a logistic regression analysis were adjusted for 
age and occupation. Both leisure aerobic and work activity of all athlete groups 
was higher (P < 0.01) than that of referents. Compared with the referents, both 
power and ""mixed"" athletes were more prone to eat fruits and vegetables and to 
avoid vitamin supplements, but less prone to use butter and high-fat milk, and 
to smoke (odds ratios different from 1.0, P < 0.05). Also endurance athletes 
smoked less and drank less alcohol than the referents (P < 0.05). Higher leisure 
aerobic activity and less frequent smoking after athletic years might explain 
higher life expectancy of Finnish athletes."
8166227,"d-Tubocurarine (curare) is a well-characterized competitive antagonist of 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), and it is usually assumed that curare 
and agonists share a common binding site. We have examined the role of several 
highly conserved residues of the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunits in the 
interaction of curare with the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Curare 
inhibition of wild-type receptors is consistent with curare binding to a single 
high-affinity binding site [inhibitor constant (Ki) = 20 nM]. Phenylalanine 
substitutions for two tyrosine residues implicated as being in the ligand 
binding site (alpha Y93F, alpha Y190F) reduce curare affinity, indicating that 
these residues are also important for high-affinity curare binding. 
Phenylalanine substitution for alpha Y198 [alpha Y198F (notation used here: 
subunit/amino acid in wild-type/residue number/substitution)] causes a 10-fold 
increase in curare affinity (Ki = 3.1 nM), and measurement of the recovery from 
curare inhibition indicates that this increase in affinity is due to a reduction 
in the rate of curare dissociation from the receptor. In addition to the 
alpha-subunits, portions of the ligand binding sites also reside on the gamma- 
and delta-subunits, and photoaffinity studies have implicated two residues 
(gamma W55 and delta W57) as forming part of the curare sites. The gamma W55L 
mutation results in an eightfold decrease in curare affinity (Ki = 170 nM), 
whereas the delta W57L mutation has no effect. These data support the notion 
that the high-affinity curare binding site is formed by segments of the alpha- 
and gamma-subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A total of 36 consecutive subjects, 32 women and 4 men, complaining of BMS, who 
had attended the Dental Clinic of the University of Ferrara during a period of 2 
years, was studied. The method of assessment followed closely a strictly 
co-ordinated management protocol based on conventional guidelines, namely 
history, clinical examination and special investigations. A detailed history was 
taken of duration of the condition, site affected, and pattern of burning. The 
severity and the response to treatment were assessed with a Visual Linear 
Analogue Scale (VLAS). A full medical history was taken, with regard to 
xerostomia-inducing drug assumption. The presence and the severity of menopausal 
symptoms were explored. Inquiries were made on use of mouthwashes. For the 
denture-wearers, specific questioning was directed to the length of 
denture-wearing experience, temporal association of the symptom with the wearing 
of dentures, relationship to burning sensation of any relines or repairs, 
denture cleaning technique, and use of fixatives. A complete routine intraoral 
and extraoral examination was performed. The presence of parafunctional habits, 
such as tongue thrusting, clenching, grinding, lip and cheek biting, was 
investigated. If dentures were worn, their design and condition were examined. 
In particular, the relation between the vertical and horizontal components of

8175343,"In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon 
could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, 
scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock 
tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc. The 
interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the 
isomorphic reactions varied from case to case. In SLE patients receiving 
systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not 
be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never 
received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones. It was not seen in patients with 
localized DLE. There was no direct relationship between the appearance of 
humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon. With regard to the 
histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of 
the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression 
of adhesion molecules, might be involved. The Koebner phenomenon may be a 
valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus."
8175773,"The initial step in the clearance of apolipoprotein (apo) E-enriched remnant 
lipoproteins from the plasma appears to be sequestration within the liver 
mediated by their binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The 
surface-bound remnants are believed to be internalized by their interaction with 
the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein or by the LDL 
receptor. Cholesterol-induced rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins 
(beta-VLDL) enriched in human apoE3 display 4-5-fold enhanced binding to 
cultured cells. The present study attempts to determine whether recessive versus 
dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia might be explained, at least in part, by 
a variable interaction of the mutant forms of apoE with the HSPG and impaired 
uptake. The beta-VLDL+apoE2(Arg158-->Cys), which is associated with recessive 
type III hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly than beta-VLDL+apoE3 but still 
possessed significant enhanced binding (approximately 2-2.5-fold compared with 
beta-VLDL without added apoE) to HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells. In comparison, 
beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg142-->Cys), beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg145-->Cys), and 
beta-VLDL+apoE-Leiden, which are associated with dominant type III 
hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly. This same hierarchy of binding and 
uptake was determined by [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters in 
LDL receptor-negative cells and by secretion of apoE3 and the variant apoE forms 
from McA-RH7777 cells. Furthermore, the enhanced binding of the apoE-enriched 
beta-VLDL was almost totally inhibited by heparinase treatment of the cells, and 
the basal binding activity was inhibited by 80-90% following addition of an LDL 
receptor antibody capable of blocking receptor-ligand interaction. The beta-VLDL 
enriched in apoE or apoE-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine complexes bound to 
isolated HSPG from McA-RH7777 cells or the rat liver to a very similar degree. 
Likewise, the binding of beta-VLDL plus the various forms of apoE to the LDL 
receptor-related protein on ligand blots paralleled the results of other 
studies. In conclusion, all of the type III hyperlipoproteinemic apoE variants 
are defective in displaying enhanced binding to HSPG and in the cellular uptake 
initiated by HSPG. However, apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) displayed more activity than the 
variants associated with the dominant forms of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. 
The hierarchy of binding and uptake was as follows: apoE3 > apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) 
> apoE(Arg145-->Cys) > apoE(Arg142-->Cys) approximately apoE-Leiden (the latter 
two usually displaying very little, if any, enhanced binding and uptake). Thus, 
a correlation exists between the mode of expression of type III 
hyperlipoproteinemia and the binding and uptake of the specific apoE mutation."
8175878,"We have developed a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method to examine 
the structure of both natural chromosomes and small artificial chromosomes 
during the mitotic cycle of budding yeast. Our results suggest that the pairing 
of sister chromatids: (a) occurs near the centromere and at multiple places 
along the chromosome arm as has been observed in other eukaryotic cells; (b) is 
maintained in the absence of catenation between sister DNA molecules; and (c) is 
independent of large blocks of repetitive DNA commonly associated with 
heterochromatin. Condensation of a unique region of chromosome XVI and the 
highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster from chromosome XII were also 
examined in budding yeast. Interphase chromosomes were condensed 80-fold 
relative to B form DNA, similar to what has been observed in other eukaryotes, 
suggesting that the structure of interphase chromosomes may be conserved among 
eukaryotes. While additional condensation of budding yeast chromosomes were 
observed during mitosis, the level of condensation was less than that observed 
for human mitotic chromosomes. At most stages of the cell cycle, both unique and 
repetitive sequences were either condensed or decondensed. However, in cells 
arrested in late mitosis (M) by a cdc15 mutation, the unique DNA appeared 
decondensed while the repetitive rDNA region appeared condensed, suggesting that 
the condensation state of separate regions of the genome may be regulated 
differently. The ability to monitor the pairing and condensation of sister 
chromatids in budding yeast should facilitate the molecular analysis of these 
processes as well as provide two new landmarks for evaluating the function of 
important cell cycle regulators like p34 kinases and cyclins. Finally our FISH 
method provides a new tool to analyze centromeres, telomeres, and gene 
expression in budding yeast."

Neurol., in press]. This neuronal class is mostly encountered in the vestibular 
part of the cerebellum, although also present in the rest of the vermal folia. 
The UBC axon, as seen in Golgi impregnated material, has a tortuous course 
throughout the granular layer and gives off number of collaterals of variable 
diameter. Some of the axon collaterals enter the white matter only for a short 
distance, after which they ascend into the granular layer. Astonishingly, some 
of the thick granular collaterals of these axons display characteristic 
expansions resembling the rosette excrescences seen on mossy fibers. In our 
series these rosettes are mostly of the simple type [Palay, S. and Chan-Palay, 
V., Cerebellar Cortex. Cytology and Organization, Springer, Berlin, 1974], i.e. 
short swellings with simple globular contours. The exact projection targets and 
functional effect of the UBC axon and granular rosettes have still to be 
demonstrated."

cardiac arrhythmias. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may worsen 
the disordered breathing. Nasal bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), 
however, may help alleviate the breathing problem and eliminate sleep-related 
arrhythmias."
8178941,"Mutations in the K-ras oncogene and in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are 
commonly identified in sporadic cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although 
these genes might serve as useful markers for early diagnosis of pancreatic 
carcinoma in patients at risk for the development of this disease, familial 
pancreatic carcinomas have not been studied for these mutations. We recently had 
the opportunity to examine a pancreas prophylactically removed from a patient 
with a strong family history of pancreatic carcinoma. This gave us the unique 
opportunity to study the early events in the development of familial 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Histopathological examination of the pancreas 
revealed multifocal papillary and nonpapillary mucinous duct hyperplasia. Seven 
of these foci were microdissected and analyzed for K-ras and p53 mutations. The 
K-ras mutations were detected by combined mutant-enriched polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and characterized 
further by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Five of the seven duct 
lesions harbored activating point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras; a G to A 
transition was found in four and a G to C transversion in one. In contrast, 
these lesions did not harbor detectable p53 mutations as determined by 
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of exons 5 to 8, nor was there 
overexpression of the p53 protein as determined by immunohistochemistry. These 
findings suggest that mutations in K-ras represent an early event in the 
pathogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. In addition, monitoring of patients with a 
strong family history of pancreatic carcinoma for K-ras mutations may identify 
patients at risk for the development of invasive carcinoma."
8178970,"Previous studies have shown that 17 beta-estradiol (beta-E2) has a direct acute 
inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction. To investigate 
the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we utilized whole cell patch-clamping 
techniques to study effects of beta-E2 on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in 
cultured VSM cells (VSMC). T- and L-type Ca2+ currents were characterized with 
ramp and pulse protocols in A7r5 cultured VSMC. T-type current, inactivated in < 
100 ms, was reduced by Ba2+ and was comparatively little affected by isradipine. 
L-type current required higher voltages to activate, inactivated slowly, was 
greatly increased by Ba2+, and could be completely inhibited by 5 microM 
isradipine. beta-E2 (10 microM) significantly reduced peak L-type Ba2+ current 
and T-type Ca2+ current within 1-2 min, whereas alpha E2 (a hormonally inactive 
isomer of estradiol) caused significantly less reduction in both types of 
current. Vehicle (0.1% ethanol) had no significant effect on either current. The 
inhibitory effect of beta-E2 on voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents may contribute 
to previously demonstrated beta-E2 attenuation of VSM contraction."
8180508,"The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleiotropic 
manifestations that involve the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. 
Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, 
the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene 
causing the Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is the large glycoprotein with a 
repetitive domain structure and is a major protein component of microfibrils, a 
fibrillar system closely associated with elastin in connective tissue. 
Mutational analysis of defects in the FBN1 gene in patients with the Marfan 
syndrome has revealed that most mutations are private or unique in an affected 
individual or family. Analysis of fibrillin protein or gene defects in 
individuals with related phenotypes has revealed that a perinatal lethal 
syndrome, termed neonatal Marfan syndrome, is due to FBN1 gene mutations. In 
addition, fibroblast cell strains from a subset of patients with idiopathic 
scoliosis have fibrillin protein defects. Last, fibroblasts from calves affected 
with bovine Marfan syndrome display defects in the fibrillin protein. These 
studies have wide-ranging implications in the diagnosis, treatment, and 
prevention of Marfan syndrome and related disorders."
8180509,"The Romano-Ward long QT syndrome, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, is 
an increasingly recognized cause of sudden cardiac death in children and adults. 
Sudden death may or may not be preceded by a history of ""seizures"" and recurrent 
syncope; the diagnosis relies on electrocardiographic evidence, including 
prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate, T wave abnormalities, 
sinus bradycardia, and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsades de 
pointes). Recently, a gene responsible for causing long QT syndrome was 
localized (using molecular genetic methods) to the short arm of chromosome 11 
(11p15.5) in the region near the Harvey ras-1 locus. The purpose of this report 
is to describe the current molecular genetic understanding of long QT syndrome, 
including information regarding gene mapping, genetic heterogeneity, and 
prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis."
8180825,"Neurofibrillary degeneration is one of the histopathological hallmarks of 
Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies have shown an association of ubiquitin 
with the cytoskeletal protein pathology in AD. In the present study, we report 
(i) the measurement of ubiquitin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 
histopathologically confirmed AD and control cases, using a new rapid 
immunoassay, the competitive enzyme-linked immunoflow assay (CELIFA), (ii) the 
determination of ubiquitin levels in brain tissue taken from the same cases, 
using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and (iii) an 
evaluation of the correlation between levels of ubiquitin in CSF and in brain 
tissue. Ubiquitin levels in CSF of AD and neurological control groups are 
significantly higher than those of non-neurological aged controls. Ubiquitin 
levels in brain homogenates of the AD group are significantly higher than those 
of both non-neurological aged and neurological control groups. The source of 
this increase in brain ubiquitin in AD is the particulate fraction, because 
ubiquitin levels in the brain cytosol fraction are the same among the three 
groups. In AD and non-neurological aged controls, there is a significant 
positive correlation between ubiquitin levels in CSF and in homogenate of 
cerebral white matter. In contrast, the correlation in the non-AD neurological 
control group has a negative tendency. These studies suggest that in AD, 
elevated levels of ubiquitin in the CSF reflect the increased amount of the 
protein in the brain and, therefore, can serve as a biomarker of the 
neuropathology in this disease."
8181495,"Cardiac tumours have been frequently reported in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis but their incidence at different ages has been evaluated in only a few 
studies. We performed echocardiography in 47 children with tuberous sclerosis 
and found tumours in 22 (47%). In none, except one newborn, did we observe any 
clinical symptoms of heart failure. Tumours were more frequent in children below 
2 years of age (91%) than in older children. As other signs of tuberous 
sclerosis are often absent in infants, echocardiography may be regarded as the 
most useful diagnostic test at this age. Follow up studies were done in 12 
children and tumour regression occurred in 6 patients."
8181531,"The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating gene mutation (yaa), first discovered in 
the BXSB mouse strain, is known to accelerate spontaneous autoantibody 
production and subsequent development of lupus disease. We have investigated the 
role of the yaa gene in the development of the type II collagen (CII)-induced 
arthritis (CIA), which is used as a model for rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast 
to the accelerating effects on development of lupus autoimmunity we can show 
that the presence of BXSB Y chromosome carrying the yaa gene block development 
of CIA in F1 crosses with three normally CIA-susceptible strains, DBA/1, C3H.Q 
and B10.Q. Backcross experiments showed an additional modulatory effect from 
other BXSB genes or possibly from DBA/1 X chromosome. To evaluate the effect 
mediated by the yaa gene alone, the BXSB Y chromosome was bred into the DBA/1 
gene background. The DBA/1 congenic DBA/1.yaa male mice were less susceptible to 
arthritis development than their DBA/1 counterparts. (B10.QxDBA/1.yaa)F1 
acquired resistance to arthritis development similar to that of DBA/1.yaa, 
indicating a role for the yaa gene alone. The serum levels of autoantibodies to 
CII were significantly suppressed in all strains carrying yaa. In DBA/1.yaa mice 
a reduced number of T cells were found to produce interferon-gamma after in 
vitro stimulation with CII. Thus, although autoreactive B cells are important in 
both diseases they play different roles in murine lupus and in CIA."

purification and characterization of cell-free BDV from the tissue culture 
supernatant of infected human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells. A single negative 
strand 10-kb RNA was detected in purified virions. Immunoprecipitation analysis

8185987,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that regular clinics might improve the 
management of urinary incontinence in general practice.
AIM: A study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence 
among women in one general practice and the feasibility of using a health 
promotion clinic in its management.
METHOD: Questionnaires were sent to a 10% sample of women aged 20 years and over 
on the practice register. Pregnant women were excluded.
RESULTS: Of 384 questionnaires sent to eligible women, 314 were completed 
correctly (82%). The overall reported prevalence of urinary incontinence was 
53%; 8% of these women had urge incontinence, 46% had stress incontinence and 
43% had mixed incontinence. Incontinence was positively correlated with parity 
and with gynaecological operation other than hysterectomy and repair of prolapse 
but not with perineal suturing after childbirth, delivery of a baby weighing 9 
lb (4.1 kg) or more or mode of delivery. Twenty seven out of 78 incontinent 
women (35%) who completed a second questionnaire admitted to worrying about 
their incontinence but only 10 (13%) had consulted their doctor about the 
problem. The main reason given for not consulting was that incontinence was a 
minor inconvenience only. The 167 incontinent women were offered an appointment 
at a women's clinic but only 13 attended. Of these, 10 were entered into a 12 
week treatment trial. Various treatments were offered, such as the women being 
taught bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. One woman was lost to follow 
up, and for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both 
subjectively and objectively.
CONCLUSION: Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem. It can be 
successfully diagnosed and treated in general practice but low attendance makes 
the health promotion clinic setting an inefficient means of achieving this."
8186659,"We report on an otherwise healthy female, mother of two children, with severe 
decompensated liver cirrhosis due to an iron overload and Wilson's disease. The 
patient was considered heterozygote for hemochromatosis on the basis of the 
autosomal recessive inheritance for hemochromatosis, the frequency of the 
hemochromatosis gene, and the laboratory parameters defining her iron overload. 
The case is interesting because of the coincidence of Wilson's disease and 
excessive iron storage."
8186692,"Plasma from patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), an 
autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission, contains antibodies that bind 
to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. Synaptotagmin associates with 
calcium channels and appears to regulate synaptic vesicle docking at the plasma 
membrane prior to rapid neurotransmitter release. Autoantibodies directed 
against a synaptotagmin-calcium channel complex may be involved in the etiology 
of LEMS. In the majority of patients LEMS is associated with small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC). We have detected the expression of proteins of the secretory 
pathway, including synaptotagmin, syntaxin and N-type calcium channels, in a 
panel of SCLC tumor lines. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis 
that the initial autoimmune response in LEMS is triggered by the tumor."
8187356,"The transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb) is often elevated in patients 
with diabetic microangiopathy. The objective of this study was to examine the 
effect of enalapril on the TERalb of diabetic patients with albuminuria and 
normal or mildly elevated blood pressure. Seventeen diabetic patients with 
diabetic retinopathy, albuminuria, a diastolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg and 
increased TERalb participated in the study. Blood pressure and TERalb were 
measured before and after 14 days of therapy with enalapril, 20 mg daily for 14 
days. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell from 168 +/- 6 to 155 +/- 6 (p 
< 0.001) and from 87 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 2 mmHg (p < 0.005) respectively. Mean 
arterial pressure declined from 114 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 3 mmHg (p < 0.0001). The 
elevated TERalb decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.2 +/- 0.5%/hr (p < 0.005). In 
the hypertensive subset, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure 
decreased significantly by 15, 7 and 10 mmHg (p < 0.005, p < 0.005 and p < 0.005 
respectively); TERalb decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.6 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.03). In 
the normotensive subset, arterial pressure remained unchanged and TERalb 
decreased from 9.0 +/- 0.8 to 6.8 +/- 1.0%/hr (p < 0.03). Plasma fructosamine 
decreased from 373 +/- 23 to 347 +/- 20 (p < 0.05) in the hypertensive group and 
remained unchanged in the normotensive patients. No correlation could be 
demonstrated between variation in TERalb and changes in blood pressure. In 
conclusion, enalapril decreases microvascular albumin leakage in patients with 
diabetic microangiopathy and normal or mildly elevated blood pressure."
8187585,"This report describes a feasibility study concerning the use of a visible diode 
laser for two important fluorescence applications in a flow cytometer. With a 3 
mW 635 nm diode laser, we performed immunofluorescence measurements using the 
fluorophore allophycocyanin (APC). We have measured CD8 positive lymphocytes 
with a two-step labeling procedure and the resulting histograms showed good 
separation between the negative cells and the dim and the bright fluorescent 
subpopulations. As a second fluorescence application, we chose DNA analysis with 
the recently developed DNA/RNA stains TOTO-3 and TO-PRO-3. In our setup TO-PRO-3 
yielded the best results with a CV of 3.4%. Our results indicate that a few 
milliwatts of 635 nm light from a visible diode laser is sufficient to do single 
color immunofluorescence measurements with allophycocyanin and DNA analysis with 
TO-PRO-3. The major advantages of using a diode laser in a flow cytometer are 
the small size, the low price, the high efficiency, and the long lifetime."
8188292,"Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) is a mitochondrial, biotin-dependent enzyme, 
composed of an equal number of alpha and beta subunits, that functions in the 
catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and other metabolites. Mutations of the 
PCCA (alpha subunit) or PCCB (beta subunit) gene cause the inherited metabolic 
disease, propionic acidemia. We report the cloning of a full-length cDNA 
encoding the beta subunit of human PCC. The open reading frame encodes a 
pre-beta polypeptide of 539 amino acids (58,205 Da). The cDNA was introduced 
into the expression vector, pRc/CMV, and microinjected into the nucleus or, as 
ribotranscripts, into the cytoplasm of fibroblast lines from patients with 
defects of the beta subunit. The restoration of function was monitored by 
autoradiography of PCC-dependent [14C]-propionate incorporation into cellular 
protein. These results confirm the completeness of the clone and demonstrate the 
capacity for beta subunits derived from the microinjected cDNA or RNA to be 
transported into mitochondria and assembled with endogenously derived alpha 
subunits to form functional PCC."
8190479,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe the heterogeneous phenotype of 
individuals with an unusual type of albinism--minimal pigment oculocutaneous 
albinism.
METHODS: Nine patients with minimal pigment oculocutaneous albinism were 
identified and followed for up to 11 years. The criteria were the presence of 
oculocutaneous albinism in association with low hairbulb tyrosinase activity in 
the patient and disparate activity in the parents with one parent having normal 
activity and the other having low tyrosinase activity. Changes in skin, hair, 
and ocular pigment were followed as the patients matured. As a measure of ocular 
pigment, iris transillumination and macular transparency were graded according 
to a previously published scheme.
RESULTS: Patients were born with white scalp hair and skin, and nystagmus 
developed. Visual acuity was reduced to 20/50 to 20/200 for the group, but in 
one patient vision improved with maturity. Irides were blue. In seven patients, 
iris pigment developed, which was detected by transillumination with slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy, including the one patient with improved visual acuity. All 
patients had foveal hypoplasia, and melanin pigment in the fundi could not be 
detected by clinical examination. Visual acuity in the group did not correlate 
directly with the presence or development of iris transillumination or macular 
transparency. The pedigrees were consistent with an autosomal recessive 
inheritance pattern.
CONCLUSION: This unique type of oculocutaneous albinism has heterogeneous 
clinical features. Minimal pigment oculocutaneous albinism appears to represent 
a new type of tyrosinase-related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1MP)."
8194267,"We presented a case of probable Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. A 
39-year-old woman developed easy falling, progressive consciousness disturbance, 
total ophthalmoplegia, and bilateral pyramida tract sign. In serum 
anti-ganglioside antibody assay using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, high 
anti-GQ1b antibody was found. Electroencephalography was dominated by alpha 
activity, superimposed with occasional theta wave bursts. Brain MRI showed 
abnormal signal hyperintensities in the tegmentum of the midbrain to the upper 
pons on T2 weighted images and swelling of the midbrain and pons on T1 weighted 
images. Five days after the onset of the disease, she had respiratory arrest, 
which necessitated artificial ventilation for a few days. Then, she began to 
recover. However, she gained only partial recovery, leaving upward gaze palsy, 
right abducens nerve palsy, pseudbulbar palsy and quadriplegia."
8195077,"The Escherichia coli Ada and Ogt DNA methyltransferases (MTases) are known to 
transfer simple alkyl groups from O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine, directly 
restoring these alkylated DNA lesions to guanine and thymine. In addition to 
being exquisitely sensitive to the mutagenic effects of methylating agents, E. 
coli ada ogt null mutants display a higher spontaneous mutation rate than the 
wild type. Here, we determined which base substitution mutations are elevated in 
the MTase-deficient cells by monitoring the reversion of six mutated lacZ 
alleles that revert via each of the six possible base substitution mutations. 
During exponential growth, the spontaneous rate of G:C to A:T transitions and 
G:C to C:G transversions was elevated about fourfold in ada ogt double mutant 
versus wild-type E. coli. Furthermore, compared with the wild type, stationary 
populations of the MTase-deficient E. coli (under lactose selection) displayed 
increased G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions (10- and 3-fold, respectively) 
and increased G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions (10-, 2.5-, 
and 1.7-fold, respectively). ada and ogt single mutants did not suffer elevated 
spontaneous mutation rates for any base substitution event, and the cloned ada 
and ogt genes each restored wild-type spontaneous mutation rates to the ada ogt 
MTase-deficient strains. We infer that both the Ada MTase and the Ogt MTase can 
repair the endogenously produced DNA lesions responsible for each of the five 
base substitution events that are elevated in MTase-deficient cells. Simple 
methylating and ethylating agents induced G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions 
in these strains but did not significantly induce G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and 
A:T to T:A transversions. We deduce that S-adenosylmethionine (known to e a weak 
methylating agent) is not the only metabolite responsible for endogenous DNA 
alkylation and that at least some of the endogenous metabolites that cause 
O-alkyl DNA damage in E. coli are not simple methylating or ethylating agents."
8197773,"Hereditary breast cancer (HBC) shows extant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. 
Clinically one finds the onset of breast cancer at an early age, an excess of 
bilaterality, and patterns of multiple primary cancer such as combinations of 
breast and ovarian carcinoma in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) 
syndrome. In addition to HBOC, one sees a variety of putative breast 
cancer-prone genotypes inclusive of hereditary site-specific breast cancer, and 
the Li-Fraumeni (SBLA) syndrome that is characterized by cancers involving all 
three germinal layers including sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia, lymphoma, and 
adrenal cortical carcinoma in addition to often markedly early-onset breast 
cancer. Breast cancer is also associated with autosomal dominantly inherited 
Cowden's disease and autosomal recessively inherited ataxia-telangiectasia. 
Examples of pedigrees depicting clinical examples of these several HBC syndromes 
are presented in order to describe HBC's heterogeneity. The recent 
identification of the BRCA1 gene in early-onset hereditary site-specific breast 
cancer and the HBOC syndrome has led to new challenges for the genetic 
counselor. We review genetic counseling, which embraces surveillance and 
management recommendations that are responsive to the natural history of HBC and 
address the concept for future development of centers of expertise for HBC in 
the interest of improving cancer control."
8198037,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is probably the most common cause of sudden 
cardiac death in youthful athletes, and this diagnosis has represented a 
contraindication to continued participation in competitive sports. Less well 
appreciated is the fact that within the clinical spectrum of HC are patients 
who, despite having this disease, have been able to undertake particularly 
intensive and often extraordinary levels of training for sports competition over 
many years without dying suddenly. Fourteen such patients (13 men and 1 woman, 
aged 30 to 66 years [mean 43]) form the present study group. HC was initially 
identified at 24 to 57 years of age (mean 34), usually under fortuitous 
circumstances. Patients most often competed in distance running (including the 
marathon, 7), but also in swimming, triathalon, basketball, and football. The 
duration of training ranged from 6 to 22 years (mean 15) and 5 continue to train 
and compete actively. The magnitude of training, competition, and achievement 
was considerable in most patients; 12 of the 14 performed either at the 
national, collegiate or professional level in their sport, completed numerous 
marathon and triathalon events, or sustained particularly rigorous training 
regimens of > or = 50 miles/week. Echocardiographic studies demonstrated a left 
ventricular wall thickness of 18 to 28 mm (mean 20) in most patients (12 of 14) 
having a relatively localized pattern of ventricular septal hypertrophy. It is 
possible for some patients with HC to tolerate particularly intense athletic 
training and competition for many years, and even maintain high levels of 
achievement without incurring symptoms and disease progression or dying 
suddenly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8198763,"Apolipoprotein E (apo E) plays a role in the regulation of the lipid metabolism 
of humans. Apo E, 229 amino acid polypeptide, is classified into three major 
isoform (E2, E3, E4) according to the differences of amino acid in position 112 
and 158. In the normal population apo E3 isoform is most prevalent and apo E2 or 
E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. To find out the frequency 
of apo E isoform distribution in the Korean population, apo E genotyping was 
performed. After amplification of apoE gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
restriction isotyping was done by cleavage with restriction enzyme Hha I and 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apo E allele frequency in 73 normal 
subjects was 4.8% for E2, 84.9% for E3 and 10.3% for E4. In diabetic patient 
with hyperlipoproteinemia, the frequency of apo E allele was 6.3% for E2, 81.0% 
for E3 and 12.7% for E4. There was no significant difference in apo E isoform 
distribution between diabetics and normal populations. But in patients with 
cardiovascular disease with hyperlipidemia, the apo E4 allele frequency was 
significantly higher than normal (20.0% vs 10.3%, p < 0.005). Apo E3 was the 
most common isoform in normal and diabetic subjects and apo E2 isoform was 
rather low frequency compared to Caucasians. This pattern is similar to the 
Japanese population but somewhat different from other populations. From the data 
of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with 
hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of 
hyperlipoproteinemia. The PCR method may be useful in apo E genotyping."
8199011,"A transfection-reactivated Coxsackievirus B3 (rCVB3), from a full-length cDNA 
clone of Nancy strain, has previously been shown to be as cardiovirulent as the 
wild-type virus. Myocarditis induced by this genetically defined virus was 
compared in SWR mice with the traditional Balb/c model. SWR mice inoculated with 
rCVB3 developed more severe myocarditis but less severe pancreatitis than Balb/c 
mice. In contrast to the poor general health and frequent mortality of Balb/c 
mice following CVB3 infection, the body weight of SWR mice was not affected by 
CVB3 inoculation and no mortality occurred at titres of 10(2)-10(7) plaque 
forming units (PFU). Typical myocarditis developed in SWR mice 7 days post 
infection. Myocarditic foci consisting of necrotic myocardial fibres and 
mononuclear cell infiltrates resolved by day 30, similar to that observed in 
Balb/c. However, SWR mice were more sensitive to rCVB3-induced myocarditis than 
were Balb/c mice: mild myocarditis was induced (4/4) by as low as 10(2) PFU of 
the virus (ID50 < 10(1.5) PFU), and more severe myocarditis was seen at higher 
PFU of virus in a dose-dependent manner. The SWR model was tested with 
attenuated variants derived from cardiovirulent rCVB3. The ID50 for myocarditis 
was 10(7) PFU for a large plaque-size attenuant and 10(6) PFU for a minute 
plaque-size attenuant, indicating loss of cardiovirulence by a factor of more 
than 10(4)-10(5). rCVB3-induced SWR mouse is a sensitive and reliable model for 
myocarditis. It is useful in assessing the cardiovirulence of different CVB3 
variants and evaluating the efficacies of anti-viral therapies. It will allow 
follow-up study after high dose infection with cardiovirulent rCVB3."
8199664,"It has recently been suggested that the inhalation of coal in the absence of 
complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) or smoking can lead to disabling 
airways obstruction. The cause of such obstruction has been variously attributed 
to emphysema or bronchitis. The frequency of significant airways obstruction in 
a group of United States coal miners seeking compensation for occupationally 
induced pulmonary impairment was therefore determined. In a sample of 611 ""Black 
Lung"" claimants there was only one subject who was a non-smoker and who in the 
absence of other non-occupationally related diseases,--for example, asthma and 
bronchiectasis--had sufficient airways obstruction to render it difficult for 
him to carry out hard labour. An alternative explanation for his reduced 
ventilatory capacity other than coal dust or smoking may be available. If the 
inhalation of coal dust in the absence of smoking and complicated CWP ever 
induces sufficient ventilatory impairment to preclude a miner from working, it 
is indeed rare."

8204006,"Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are 
frequently considered to be different tumors. Some researchers have suggested 
that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to 
determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct 
patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of 
readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases). Light microscopic, ultrastructural, and 
immunophenotypic parameters were assessed and compared for both groups. The 
avidin-biotin complex method was used. All tumors were antigenically intact 
since all stained for vimentin or at least one marker. Neuroectodermal antigens 
(neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were 
found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB. In ESB, an 
atypical light microscopic appearance correlated with the presence of 
neuroectodermal features in most cases, but neuroectodermal phenotype was more 
frequent (68%) than morphological evidence of neuroectodermal differentiation 
(36%). These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral 
primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal 
phenotype and morphological differentiation."
8205296,"The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was studied in 45 patients with 
mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age 59 years) using casual and ambulatory 
24-h blood pressure measurement. Patients were included into the study according 
to their casual blood pressure. Isradipine was started at a dose of 1.25 mg 
twice daily for 4 weeks, and increased to 2.5 mg twice daily if casual blood 
pressure was not normalized. If necessary, 3 mg of spirapril, a new 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, (n = 1) or 5 mg of pindolol (n = 
1) was added. The active-treatment period lasted 24 weeks. At the end of the 
therapy, casual blood pressure was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) from 
173/103 to 150/86 mmHg, and mean ambulatory blood pressure, from 146/87 to 
140/83 mmHg (p < 0.05). When patients were divided into three groups according 
to initial whole-day ambulatory blood pressure values (group I: < 140/90 mmHg; 
group II: > or = 140/90 mmHg; group III: > or = 140/<90 mmHg), no effect of 
treatment was detected in group I. However, whole-day blood pressure fell 
significantly (p < 0.001) in group II (155/96 vs 143/88 mmHg) as did systolic 
blood pressure (p < 0.01) in group III (150/83 vs 142/81 mmHg), whereas 
diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. Thus, ambulatory blood pressure 
measurement may be superior to casual measurement in the decision-making process 
to treat hypertension, avoiding not only the phenomenon of 'white-coat 
hypertension', but also ineffective treatment. This conclusion, however, should 
be confirmed by prospective studies."
8207801,"Transformation by the human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene products, E6 and E7, 
involves their interaction with cellular proteins p53 and Rb. Using glutathione 
S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, we found that HPV E6 bound human p53 and 
that the relative efficiency of binding varied such that the GST-HPV type 16 E6 
(16E6) protein bound p53 with highest affinity, followed by GST-31E6, GST-18E6, 
and GST-11E6. The GST-E6 fusion proteins were sufficient for binding p53 
purified from a baculovirus expression system as well as in vitro translation 
sources, while no association was observed with GST-18E7 or a GST-16E6 mutant 
bearing a five-amino-acid deletion in E6. When the site-specific DNA binding 
activity of p53 was examined in the presence of GST-E6 proteins, an inhibition 
of DNA binding was observed. The degree of inhibition correlated with the 
relative affinity of different E6 proteins for p53; thus, GST-16E6 was the most 
potent inhibitor of p53 DNA binding activity, and GST-11E6 was the least 
effective. Prevention of p53 DNA binding is likely to play a role in the 
abrogation of the transcriptional activity of p53 by HPV E6 and provides a 
further mechanism for E6 disruption of p53 growth suppressor function in 
addition to its role in directing specific degradation of p53 through the 
ubiquitin-mediated pathway. The variation in inhibition of DNA binding seen with 
the various E6 proteins may thus contribute to the differences in oncogenic 
potential seen among the HPV types."
8207974,"We performed conventional cytogenetic (CC) and interphase fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) analysis with an alpha satellite chromosome 7 specific DNA 
centromeric probe (p alpha 7t1) on bone marrow material prepared for CC in 11 
controls and 80 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In controls, a mean of 
4.3 +/- 1% of the 700 cells examined showed only one FISH signal for chromosome 
7, and the finding of > 6.3% (mean +2 standard deviations) of cells with one 
FISH signal was considered to indicate the presence of a clone with -7. By CC, 
clonal -7 was found in 11 patients, whereas two patients had -7 in only one 
mitose (non-clonal -7). In eight of the 11 cases of clonal -7 by CC, interphase 
FISH confirmed -7. In the remaining three patients, 5.1%, 6.3% and 18.4% 
respectively of the cells had one signal. Those three patients had, in addition 
to -7 by CC, a marker chromosome which was shown to be constituted of chromosome 
7 pericentromeric material by FISH analysis on metaphase spreads (metaphase 
FISH). Of the two patients with non-clonal -7 by CC, one had a -7 clone by 
interphase FISH whereas the other patient had normal FISH results. Five of the 
67 patients with no -7 mitose by CC had clonal -7 by interphase FISH, with one 
chromosome 7 signal in 14.4 to 39% of the cells examined. At least three mitoses 
with -7 were found in two of them by metaphase FISH. Three of the five patients 
were reexamined 12 to 17 months later: CC and metaphase FISH found no -7, 
whereas interphase FISH still showed a -7 clone. Three of the patients with 
clonal -7 by CC and by FISH were reexamined in complete hematological remission 
after intensive therapy. CC found no -7 and interphase FISH was normal in all 
three patients. Our findings suggest that interphase FISH may improve the 
detection of -7 in MDS. Conventional cytogenetics should still be performed in 
parallel to FISH, however, because of possible false negative FISH results when 
a pericentromeric chromosome 7 marker is present in patients with -7. Larger 
numbers of cases with minor -7 clones, detectable by FISH only, and longer 
follow-up in those cases will be necessary to determine the significance of this 
finding, the evolution of this minor clone, and the outcome of the patients."
8213473,"Until recently, only three calcium channel antagonists--verapamil, diltiazem and 
nifedipine--were available for managing cardiovascular disorders such as 
hypertension and ischemic heart disease. In the past few years, however, several 
dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, including nicardipine, isradipine, 
felodipine, nimodipine, and amlodipine, have been marketed. Others are currently 
awaiting FDA approval. In addition, bepridil, which belongs to a new class of 
calcium channel antagonists, has recently been marketed for refractory angina 
pectoris. Clinical uses of calcium channel antagonists have been expanded since 
the 1970s to include management of cardiovascular disorders such as 
supraventricular arrhythmias, CHF secondary to diastolic dysfunction, and 
myocardial reinfarction in selected patients. Calcium channel antagonists are 
also being investigated for prevention of atherosclerosis. Calcium channel 
antagonists are a heterogeneous group of pharmacologic agents. Differences in 
tissue selectivity are largely responsible for the variations in hemodynamic and 
electrophysiologic properties of these agents. Thus, their clinical uses and 
side effect profiles differ. These differences must be taken into consideration 
in the selection of the most appropriate agent for a specific indication. 
Potential advantages of some of the newer dihydropyridine calcium channel 
antagonists include less frequent dosing (amlodipine and isradipine) and little 
or no negative inotropic effect (nicardipine, felodipine, amlodipine, 
isradipine) compared with the prototype calcium channel antagonists. Additional 
clinical experience with these newer agents is required, however, before their 
role in the management of cardiovascular disorders can be fully delineated. The 
availability of sustained-release formulations of verapamil, diltiazem, 
nifedipine, felodipine, and nicardipine, as well as the recent marketing of 
calcium channel antagonists with relatively long half-lives (amlodipine and 
isradipine), makes once- or twice-daily dosing possible with most calcium 
channel blockers. However, selection of a particular agent will depend on 
several factors, including clinical efficacy, side effect profile, cost, and 
patient characteristics such as concomitant disease states and baseline 
hemodynamic status."
8213821,"The frequency of nine different mutated alleles known to occur in the 
glucocerebrosidase gene was determined in 247 Gaucher patients, of whom 176 were 
of Jewish extraction, 2 were Jewish with one converted parent, and 69 were of 
non-Jewish origin. DNA was prepared from peripheral blood, active 
glucocerebrosidase sequences were amplified by using the PCR technique, and the 
mutations were identified by using the allele-specific oligonucleotide 
hybridization method. The N37OS mutation appeared in 69.77% of the mutated 
alleles in Jewish patients and in 22.86% of the mutated alleles in non-Jews. The 
84GG mutation, which has not been found so far among non-Jewish patients, 
existed in 10.17% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients. The IVS + 1 
mutation constituted 2.26% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients and 
1.43% among the non-Jewish patients. RecTL, a complex allele containing four 
single-base-pair changes, occurred in 2.26% of the alleles in Jewish patients 
and was found in two (1.43%) of the patients of non-Jewish extraction. Another 
complex allele, designated ""RecNciI"" and containing three single-point 
mutations, appeared in 7.8% of alleles of non-Jewish patients and in only two 
(0.56%) of the Jewish families. The prevalence of the L444P mutation among 
non-Jewish Gaucher patients was 31.43%, while its prevalence among Jewish 
patients was only 4.24%. The prevalence of two other point mutations--D409H and 
R463C--was 5.00% and 3.57%, respectively, among non-Jewish patients and was not 
found among the Jewish Gaucher patient population. The prevalence of the R496H 
mutation, found so far only among Jewish patients, was 1.13%. The results 
presented demonstrate that seven mutations identify 90.40% of the mutations 
among Jewish patients and that these seven mutations allow diagnosis of only 
73.52% of the non-Jewish patients. Identification of additional mutant alleles 
will enhance the accuracy of carrier detection."
8214350,"A study of epileptic drop attacks (EDA) by simultaneous video-polygraphic 
recordings was carried out in one epileptic patient with myoclonic astatic 
seizures (Doose syndrome). EDA was shown to correspond to a burst of generalized 
bilaterally synchronous spike and wave complexes (GBSSW) at 3 Hz. Absence 
seizures were also observed with a burst of GBSSW with similar characteristics. 
The amplitudes of the corresponding slow wave component of GBSSW among the three 
intensities of atonia, i.e. complete atonia, minor atonia and no discernible 
atonia (control), was compared. A high amplitude was demonstrated to correspond 
with more pronounced atonia and a lower amplitude with reduced or absent atonia. 
These findings suggest that EDA corresponding to GBSSW have a neurophysiological 
mechanism in common with absence seizures, and that if the GBSSW is intense, it 
may be sufficient to cause immediate loss of global muscle tone."
8217842,"The daughterless (da) gene in Drosophila functions in the regulation of at least 
three significant developmental pathways: sex determination, neurogenesis and 
oogenesis. As a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of DNA binding 
proteins, the da gene product appears to act as a transcription factor. Based on 
the genetic and molecular characterization of da, it has been proposed that the 
da protein (Da) functions as a generic member of this family, serving throughout 
development as a necessary binding partner for an assortment of other HLH 
proteins. As a result of temporally and/or spatially restricted expression, 
these binding partners would provide some regulatory specificity to the 
functional transcription complex. In order to participate in this way in the 
regulation of multiple genes, Da must be expressed in numerous times and places 
during development. Using anti-Da antibodies, we validate two predictions of 
this scenario of Da function: (1) Da protein is not only nuclear localized, but 
also associated with chromosomes in vivo; and (2) Da protein is widely 
distributed, both spatially and temporally, throughout development. With regard 
to the essential role of maternal da+ in progeny sex determination, little, if 
any, Da protein is synthesized in the maternal germline. This suggests that the 
female-specific germline function of da+ is provided to the zygote as maternally 
synthesized RNA that becomes translated early in embryogenesis."
8260178,"A review of 775 normally pigmented Africans and 18 African albinos with 
malignant skin tumours showed that squamous cell carcinoma was the most common 
tumour type, in contrast to Caucasians, in whom basal cell carcinoma is most 
frequent. In African albinos squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region 
was most frequent. However, the proportion of basal cell carcinomas was low also 
among albinos but higher than among normally pigmented patients. In contrast to 
the normally pigmented patients, there were no squamous cell carcinomas on the 
limbs in albino patients. We suggest that this difference was due to 
environmental factors, such as chronic leg ulcers, which might have been less 
influential in the albinos, who seldom lived more than 30 years. No cases of 
cutaneous melanoma or Kaposi sarcoma were found in the albino group."
8260718,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome 7 specific alpha 
satellite DNA probe was used to detect monosomy 7 in interphase and metaphase 
cells obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute 
nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Chromosome analysis revealed monosomy 7, either 
alone or as part of a complex chromosome abnormality, in all cell samples. FISH 
analyses of 12 marrow samples and a blood sample using a chromosome 7 specific 
alpha satellite DNA probe revealed a single fluorescence spot in 80.5-97.5% of 
interphase cells indicating monosomy 7. In contrast, 83.5-92.0% of the same 
cells had two copies of chromosome 17 as two fluorescent spots were detected 
using a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite DNA probe used as a positive 
control. The proportion of interphase cells with monosomy 7 did not correlated 
with the percentage of metaphase cells with monosomy 7 detected by conventional 
karyotyping or with the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow."
8261754,"In order to evaluate patients with necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and to 
compare them with age, sex, and duration of diabetes matched controls, 15 
patients with necrobiosis were each matched with 5 control subjects with 
diabetes mellitus. Complications of diabetes, glycaemic control, and proteinuria 
were measured. Patients with necrobiosis (mean age 40, range 18-74 years) had a 
mean duration of diabetes of 14 (range 3-36) years; 8 patients were male, and 7 
were female. For necrobiosis versus controls, background retinopathy (67% vs 
27%, p = 0.009), proteinuria (53% vs 17%, p = 0.006), and smoking (60% vs 20%, p 
= 0.003) were all more common with necrobiosis. There were no significant 
differences between patients with necrobiosis and control patients in the 
prevalence of vascular disease and neuropathy. Glycosylated haemoglobin 
concentrations were higher in patients with necrobiosis (p = 0.02). Blood 
pressure measurements were similar in both groups. We conclude that smoking, 
proteinuria, and retinopathy were more prevalent in diabetic patients with 
necrobiosis; the skin lesion may therefore share common aetiological factors 
which affect the microvascular circulation, leading to damage to basement 
membranes and vascular endothelial cells."
8262007,"In the 20 yr since it was established that impairment of dihydrotestosterone 
formation is the cause of a rare form of human intersex, a wealth of information 
has accumulated about the genetics, endocrinology, and variable phenotypic 
manifestations, culminating in the cloning of cDNAs encoding two 5 
alpha-reductase genes and documentation that mutations in the steroid 5 
alpha-reductase 2 gene are the cause of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. Perplexing 
and difficult problems remain unresolved, e.g. whether the variability in 
manifestations is due to variable expressions of steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 or 
to effects of testosterone itself. It is also imperative to establish whether 
defects in steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2, perhaps in the heterozygous state, are 
responsible for a portion of cases of sporadic hypospadias, to determine whether 
5 alpha-reductase plays a role in progesterone action in women, and to elucidate 
the relation between androgen action and gender role behavior."
8262564,"A highly sensitive quantitative fluorometric assay for phagocytosis, previously 
measured using fluorescence spectrophotometry or flow cytometry, has been 
adapted for use with a 96-well fluorescence plate reader. The technique allows 
rapid analysis of large numbers of samples, and requires only a small sample 
volume. Comparison of plate types demonstrated that opaque white 96-well 
luminostrips produced a 100 fold greater fluorescent output, and were more 
sensitive than black fluoroplates. Intraplate variability was also significantly 
lower using white luminostrips. For the phagocytic assay, fluorescein conjugated 
polystyrene beads were incubated with macrophage monolayers in white 
luminostrips. After incubation, cells were washed, lysed and phagocytosis 
quantified by determining the fluorescent intensity using a fluorescence plate 
reader. The number of beads phagocytized was determined from a standard curve of 
bead number versus fluorescent output. The phagocytic activity of resident and 
thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages was compared using this 
technique."
8263140,"Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of 
probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune 
diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). 
Approximately 60% of patients with SMS have high titers of autoantibodies 
against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Similar to SMS, the majority of 
patients with IDDM have autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase at or 
before diabetes onset, although usually at a lower titer and with a different 
reaction pattern than patients with SMS. To investigate the immunogenetic basis 
of SMS, we HLA-typed 18 patients with the disease. Seventy-two percent carried 
the DQB1*0201 allele (13 of 18, P = 0.02 vs. 18 of 48 controls), indicating that 
SMS is associated with this allele. DQB1*0201 is also a susceptibility allele 
for IDDM and other autoimmune diseases. Patients with SMS carried the 
IDDM-protective DQB1*0602 allele and other sequence-related DQB1*06 alleles with 
the same frequency observed in controls. In contrast, these alleles are rarely 
found in IDDM. Five of 8 (62.5%) SMS patients lacking a DQB1*06 allele were 
diabetic in contrast to only 2 of 10 (20%) with a DQB1*06 allele (P = 0.08), 
suggesting that the presence of DQB1*0602 or other DQB1*06 alleles may be 
associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes among patients with SMS."
8264648,"Lysine 1423 of neurofibromin (neurofibromatosis type I gene product [NF1]) plays 
a crucial role in the function of NF1. Mutations of this lysine were detected in 
samples from a neurofibromatosis patient as well as from cancer patients. To 
further understand the significance of this residue, we have mutated it to all 
possible amino acids. Functional assays using yeast ira complementation have 
revealed that lysine is the only amino acid that produced functional NF1. 
Quantitative analyses of different mutant proteins have suggested that their 
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity is drastically reduced as a result of a 
decrease in their Ras affinity. Such a requirement for a specific residue is not 
observed in the case of other conserved residues within the GAP-related domain. 
We also report that another residue, phenylalanine 1434, plays an important role 
in NF1 function. This was first indicated by the finding that defective NF1s due 
to an alteration of lysine 1423 to other amino acids can be rescued by a second 
site intragenic mutation at residue 1434. The mutation partially restored GAP 
activity in the lysine mutant. When the mutation phenylalanine 1434 to serine 
was introduced into a wild-type NF1 protein, the resulting protein acquired the 
ability to suppress activated phenotypes of RAS2Val-19 cells. This suppression, 
however, does not involve Ras interaction, since the phenylalanine mutant does 
not stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS2Val-19 protein and does not 
have an increased affinity for Ras proteins."
8264800,"Lantibiotics are defined as peptide antibiotics containing the unusual amino 
acids mesolanthionine, 3-methyllanthionine, dehydroalanine, and dehydrobutyrine. 
They are synthesized by some gram-positive bacteria. Their inhibitory effect on 
certain other gram-positive bacteria is explained by detergent-like damage of 
cytoplasmic membranes. Prominent members of the lantibiotics are nisin of 
Lactococcus lactis, which can be used as a food preservative, subtilin of 
Bacillus subtilis, which is similar to nisin, and epidermin of Staphylococcus 
epidermidis, which is considered in the treatment of acne. Lantibiotics are 
ribosomally synthesized as prepeptides, which are posttranslationally modified. 
Genes probably encoding these biosynthetic enzymes and regulatory factors have 
been identified adjacent to the structural genes of the lantibiotics subtilin, 
nisin, and epidermin."
8266579,"Original modification of the harvest procedure, hypotonic treatment and 
slide-making techniques were used to obtain prometaphase spreads of good quality 
fitted to G-banding or to FISH. Human blood cultures were synchronized with a 
methotrexate block during synthesis, and following this with a thymidine 
release. Cells were then proceeded into prometaphase and early metaphase and 
were quickly harvested without exposure to colcemid. Following incubation in a 
mixture of 0.56% KCl and 1% sodium citrate (1:1) for 20-23 min at room 
temperature, cells were fixed in 4 changes of fixative made of 3 parts of 
absolute methanol and 1 part of glacial acetic acid. Three or four 100-105 
microliters volume of a suspension of fixed cells were blew with a strength 
through pasteur pipette tip from a distance 5-6 cm onto chilled superclean 
slides wetted by water. These slides were then quickly flame dried. Prior to 
staining, prometaphase bearing spreads were held in thermostat overnight at 37 
degrees C. Prometaphases were G-banded with the aid of a modified technique 
elaborated in the Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital 
(Sweden). The slides were incubated for 1-4 min at room temperature in 0.01 
versene solution, containing 0.011% w/v trypsin (Difco), 0.4 mg/ml D-glucose, 
0.17 mg/ml KCl, 1.7 mg/ml NaCl. Following a 15 sec incubation in a solution 
containing 1 mg/ml D-glucose, 0.4 mg/ml KCl, 8 mg/ml NaCl, G-banding was 
completed by staining the slides with 2% Giemsa (Merck) in pH 6.8 phosphate 
buffer for 4-5 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8267016,"Increased intracranial pressure and ventricular and subarachnoidal dilatation 
are common manifestations in achondroplasia. They rarely lead to major 
neurologic and/or psychomotor deficits and neurosurgical intervention is seldom 
needed. The present study was undertaken to detect signs of minor cerebral 
dysfunction and discuss possibilities of their prevention. Thirty children with 
achondroplasia were compared to 3 control groups: their next-born sibs, 30 
children with other forms of dwarfism, and 30 children with normal height. Early 
development was assessed by means of questionnaires. Cognitive skills were 
evaluated with the German version of the Cognitive Abilities Test and the 
Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test. Personality data were tested using 
standardized neuroticism, extraversion, and anxiety scales. Children with 
achondroplasia had more frequent histories of delayed motor development, 
retarded speech development, and lower school grades in language-related 
specialties. Psychometric testing disclosed total and subtest scores in the 
population-based normal range. In comparison with their sibs and matched 
controls children with achondroplasia had significantly lower total scores 
mainly caused by low scores in the subtest ""verbal comprehension."" We conclude 
that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with 
achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle 
ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. Hypotonia with delayed 
oropharyngeal muscle coordination and parental response to an altered, more 
infantile instinctive releasing pattern may be contributing factors."
8269857,"We previously found that cultured neural crest-derived cells from embryonic 
quail peripheral nerves, which consist mostly of Schwann cell precursors, gave 
rise to melanocytes following treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Here, we show that 
antisense deoxyoligonucleotides targeted against two regions of the bFGF mRNA 
transcript blocked this TPA-induced transdifferentiation of Schwann cell 
precursors. Neither sense nor scrambled antisense control oligonucleotides had 
any effect in this regard. TPA increased bFGF protein expression in cell lysates 
but not in conditioned media from these cultures, and this expression was 
localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, bFGF-neutralizing 
antibodies and inositol-hexakisphosphate (InsP6) both inhibited pigmentation 
caused by exogenous bFGF, but had no affect on TPA-induced melanogenesis, 
suggesting that bFGF is not released by these cells. These data indicate that 
bFGF is necessary for the TPA-induced transdifferentiation of Schwann cell 
precursors into melanocytes and that bFGF acts via an intracrine mechanism."
8272014,"Carney's triad is defined by the coexistence of at least two of three rare 
disorders, including gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant 
leiomyoblastoma), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma, most often 
extra-adrenal and functioning. We report a new case in a 10-year-old girl. The 
paraganglioma, although nonfunctioning, was detected after it was searched for, 
as Carney's triad was suspected. Unrelated seems the development of breast 
fibroadenomas in the same patient. Whenever a patient with one component of the 
triad is encountered, the possibility of this syndrome should be considered and 
the other two components sought."
8275567,"Two unrelated Mexican girls, aged 14 months and 6 years respectively, with 
Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, are reported. Both showed psychomotor 
retardation, microcephaly, blepharophimosis and delayed growth as the main 
features; the infant also presented preauricular tags and large clitoris. 
Comparative analysis with previous cases reveals a heterogeneous syndrome in 
which the micro-brachycephaly, the mongoloid slanted eyes with different 
anomalies, the micrognathia and the neonatal respiratory distress are the most 
typical characteristics of this mental retardation syndrome."
8275569,"Congenital hypertrichosis universalis is a rare autosomal dominant disease. We 
report the further development of a Greek girl, now aged 3 years, the first case 
associated with a balanced structural chromosomal aberration. She was described 
as a neonate by Sigalas et al. (1990). Her persistent generalized hypertrichosis 
is most excessive on the face, ears and shoulders. Her fine silky hair is of the 
vellus, not the lanugo type. The syndrome features are characterized, referring 
to nine further published case reports. It is distinguished from other types of 
congenital hypertrichoses, which have been described in the literature under 
different synonyms. To avoid confusion in the terminology, we propose to name 
this type of hypertrichosis Ambras syndrome in reference to the first documented 
family with congenital hypertrichosis universalis in the 16th century."
8276234,"The assembly of multicomponent complexes at promoters, enhancers, and silencers 
likely entails perturbations in the path of the DNA helix. We present evidence 
that YY1, a ubiquitously expressed DNA-binding protein, regulates the activity 
of the c-fos promoter primarily through an effect on DNA structure. YY1 binds to 
and induces a phased DNA bend at three sites in this promoter. By use of a 
truncated c-fos promoter activity containing a single functional YY1 site, we 
show that YY1 represses promoter activity but that repression does not appear to 
be an intrinsic property of the protein in this context. Moreover, when the 
orientation of the YY1 site is reversed, YY1 activates the same promoter. 
Repression by YY1 is also alleviated by changing the relative phasing of 
factor-binding sites on either side of YY1. We conclude that the principal 
function of YY1 in this promoter is to bend DNA to regulate contact between 
other proteins. Thus, YY1 represents a new class of transcription factors that 
influences promoter function by affecting promoter structure rather than by 
directly contacting the transcriptional machinery. We provide evidence that the 
product of the male sex determination gene SRY may also belong to this class of 
structural factors."

8278949,"Hereditary intrahepatic cholestasis with lymph oedema is now a well defined 
autosomal recessive inherited syndrome. More than 75% of the known cases (about 
40) are Norwegian, and most of these came from a few communities in the 
south-western part of Norway. Cholestasis is present prior to or shortly after 
birth. With modern treatment the cholestasis usually improves considerably 
during the first two years of life, but periods of recurrent cholestasis occur 
later. In some cases, lymph oedema is present at birth, but usually comes to 
light during childhood. Lymph oedema needs continuous treatment. As a rule, the 
prognosis for the liver disease is good, but cirrhosis has developed in about 
15% of the Norwegian cases. As for the pathogenesis of the cholestasis, the 
hypothesis is that the cause is an anomaly of the lymph function."
8281145,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
resulting from the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. GALC is 
responsible for the lysosomal catabolism of galactosylceramide, a major lipid in 
myelin, kidney and epithelial cells of small intestine and colon. We describe 
the molecular cloning of human GALC cDNA and its expression in COS-1 cells. 
Degenerate PCR primers, derived from N-terminal amino acid sequence from the 51 
kDa band from human brain, were used to amplify cat testes RNA, and the 
resulting product was used to screen human testes and brain libraries. Two 
overlapping clones contained the total protein coding region, while additional 
clones and PCR amplification were needed to obtain the complete 3' end of the 
cDNA. The 3795 bp obtained include 47 bp 5' to the initiation start site, 2007 
bp of open reading frame (coding for 669 amino acids), and 1741 bp of 3' 
untranslated sequence. Modification of the sequence surrounding the initiation 
codon to one more favorable for expression, resulted in a 6-fold increase in 
GALC activity in transfected COS-1 cells. The isolation of this clone will 
permit investigations into the causes for GALC deficiency in humans and 
available animal models, development of more accurate tests for patient and 
carrier identification, and evaluation of methods for effectively treating GALC 
deficiency, initially using the animal models."
8286427,"Achalasia is a motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by total loss of 
esophageal peristalsis and by defective lower esophageal sphincter function. The 
etiology of achalasia is poorly understood. Achalasia occurs across the 
lifespan, but is uncommon in children. Most patients have progressive dysphagia 
for both liquids and solids. This article describes the symptoms of achalasia, 
its diagnosis, and treatment. The emphasis is on primary achalasia. Case studies 
illustrate common findings in patients with achalasia. The importance of patient 
education for effective management of this chronic illness is discussed."
8287902,"It has been suggested that ethanol may interact with the central nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor, thus providing a basis for the often observed high 
consumption of both ethanol and nicotine. In the present in vivo microdialysis 
study, ethanol (2.5 g/kg) moderately increased dopamine overflow in the rat 
nucleus accumbens. The central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist 
mecamylamine totally counteracted this effect in a dose (1.0 mg/kg) that did not 
alter dopamine overflow per se. Ethanol also increased the overflow of 
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, but this effect was not 
altered by mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg). Furthermore, the ethanol-induced 
enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic 
dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid 
decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3.0 and 6.0 
mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se. Neither ethanol nor mecamylamine changed 
the catecholamine synthesis rate in the striatum or the cerebral cortex. These 
results provide further evidence that ethanol-induced activation of the 
mesolimbic dopamine system (increased dopamine synthesis and release) may be 
mediated via stimulation of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is 
suggested that antagonists of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may be 
useful in the treatment of alcoholism."
8290523,"A comprehensive clinicomorphological examination of 24 children with 
Zivert-Kartagener syndrome ascertained the complete triad (bronchiectasis, 
maldevelopment of the sinuses and transposition of the viscera) in all of them. 
Initial signs of the respiratory affection are shown to arise early. The disease 
progression depended primarily on the scope of pulmonary damage. 
Electron-microscopic findings at examination of the patients' tracheal mucosa 
obtained at bronchoscopy revealed reduced number of ciliary cells and abnormal 
inner structure of the cilia. The impairment in some patients was focal. The 
attention is drawn to the benefit of early diagnosis and follow-up for such 
patients who should be treated surgically after careful consideration of 
potential risks."
8290568,"To analyze potential functional consequences of myosin heavy chain (MHC) 
mutations identified in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(FHC), we have assessed the stability of the mutant MHCs and their ability to 
form thick filaments. Constructs encoding wild-type rat alpha MHC and seven 
corresponding FHC missense mutants were transfected into COS cells. Immunoblot 
analysis suggested that FHC mutations do not grossly alter protein stability. 
Wild-type alpha MHC transfected into COS cells forms structures previously shown 
to be arrays of thick filaments, which also resemble myosin structures observed 
early in differentiation of muscle cells. Surprisingly, up to 29% of COS cells 
transfected with the FHC mutants failed to form filamentous structures. To 
assess whether this phenotype was specific for the FHC mutants and not 
generalizable to any myosin mutation, COS cells were transfected with a 
construct encoding an MHC with a 168-amino acid deletion of the hinge/rod 
region. This deletion construct formed filamentous structures with the same 
frequency as wild-type MHC. Biochemical analysis of one FHC mutant 
(Arg-249-->Gln) demonstrates that the structures formed by the mutant are 
solubilized at a lower ionic strength than those formed by wild-type MHC. We 
conclude that although the FHC mutant MHC is not labile, its assembly properties 
may be impaired."
8290673,"Consenting schizophrenic patients ranging in age from 18 to 63 years were 
withdrawn from antipsychotics for at least 1 week and randomly assigned to 
receive identical capsules of thioridazine (n = 13), molindone (n = 10), or 
haloperidol (n = 12) for a minimum of 6 weeks. Compared with the molindone- and 
haloperidol-treated patients, the thioridazine-treated patients were 
significantly improved over time as measured by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) total scores. 
Improvement in BPRS scores was due largely to improvement in symptoms of anxiety 
and depression. Subjects did not differ significantly on other measures, with 
the important exception of weight. On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds 
over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds. 
Haloperidol-treated patients had no significant weight changes."
8290959,"Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) occur at recombination hotspots during 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis and are thought to initiate exchange at these 
loci. Analysis of DSB sites in three regions of the yeast genome indicated that 
breaks occur at or near many potential transcription promoters and that DSBs 
initiate most, if not all, meiotic recombination. DSB sites displayed 
deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitivity in chromatin from mitotic and meiotic 
cells, and changes in chromatin structure produced parallel changes in the 
occurrence of DSBs. Thus, features of chromatin structure that are established 
before meiosis play a role in determining where meiotic recombination events 
initiate."
8292878,"A 45-year-old woman presented with a 10 year history of asymmetrical facial 
flushing and sweating after exertion or in hot weather. During these episodes 
the right side of her face remained dry and white, while the left side normally 
flushed. Sweating was impaired on the left side in the limbs and trunk. She also 
had areflexia in the lower limbs and slow pupillary reactions to light and 
darkness, as seen in Adie's syndrome. The topography of the sweating disorder 
suggested that the lesion involved the sympathetic pathways at the level of 
spinal cord. The relationship with the harlequin syndrome and related disorders 
is discussed."
8292886,"Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of 
the eyelid, or the orbit. Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing 
choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for 
conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and 
orbital lesions. The atypical mole syndrome (AMS) is associated with uveal and 
conjunctival melanomas, especially when the ocular lesions are multiple or 
familial. AMS patients should be screened for ocular melanomas. Conjunctival 
melanomas are managed by excision with or without adjunctive beta-irradiation. 
Circumscribed tumours have a better prognosis than diffuse and multifocal 
lesions arising in acquired melanosis and attempts should be made to limit the 
progress of the latter variant of the disease by treating PAM with cryotherapy. 
The most significant prognostic factor in uveal melanoma is the size of the 
tumour at presentation. Early dissemination is the rule and every effort should 
be made to distinguish a melanoma from a naevus as soon as possible. Small and 
medium-sized melanomas respond well to focal treatments chosen according to the 
size and location of the tumour. The techniques employed include 
photocoagulation, radioactive plaque therapy, proton beam radiotherapy and 
surgical resection."
8294487,"Structure/function relationships of acid beta-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient 
in Gaucher disease, were evaluated by characterizing the proteins expressed from 
cDNAs encoding normal and mutant enzymes. Twenty-two Gaucher disease mutations 
or created mutations were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and 
analyzed for catalytic properties, stability, inhibitor binding, and modifier 
interactions. Many Gaucher disease mutations encoded highly disruptive amino 
acid substitutions (e.g. P289L and D409V) and produced severely compromised 
proteins with very reduced activity (kcat < 1% of normal) and/or stability. Six 
mutant enzymes had sufficient catalytic activity (kcat approximately 5-30% of 
normal) for extensive studies. The highly conservative substitutions, i.e. F216Y 
or S364T and V394L, led to severe, but selective, abnormalities of enzyme 
stability or large decreases in catalytic activity, respectively. The T323I, 
N370S, and V394L enzymes interacted abnormally with active site-directed 
inhibitors and localized these residues to the glycon binding region. Selected 
mutant enzymes were poorly activated by phosphatidylserine (V394L, L444P, and 
R463C) or by saposin C (L444P and T323I), indicating that the enzyme sites for 
interaction with these activators were within the carboxyl one-third of the 
enzyme. Substitutions of Ser, Glu, and/or Gly at residues Asp-443 and/or Asp-445 
demonstrated important steric roles for these residues in the active site, but 
neither is the catalytic nucleophile. Together with previous studies, the 
present analyses provide an insight into the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and 
the functional organization of acid beta-glucosidase."
8297104,"Suramin is a prototype of a new class of anticancer drugs. We investigated the 
action of suramin on the signal transduction pathways to DNA topoisomerase II 
(Topo II). Suramin showed a growth-inhibitory effect on a human lung cancer cell 
line (PC-9) with an IC50 of about 160 micrograms/ml. Suramin inhibited the 
catalytic activity of Topo II with an IC50 of about 100 micrograms/ml without 
stabilization of the cleavable complex of DNA and Topo II. Suramin decreased the 
phosphorylation of Topo II with an IC50 of 175 micrograms/ml, but did not change 
the degree of Topo II expression. These IC50 values for inhibition of catalytic 
activity and phosphorylation of Topo II were equivalent to the growth-inhibitory 
dose determined by tetrazolium dye assay. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine 
residues of Topo II was not changed by suramin. In the presence of okadaic acid, 
a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatase, suramin also 
decreased the phosphorylation of Topo II, suggesting that the drug did not act 
on the serine/threonine protein phosphatases inhibited by okadaic acid. Suramin 
also inhibited the protein kinase C (PKC) activity of PC-9 cells. These results 
suggest that suramin decreases the phosphorylation of Topo II mediated by PKC. 
This effect of suramin might cause the inhibition of Topo II activity resulting 
in the growth inhibition of tumor cells."
8297359,"Human galactocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Krabbe disease, was 
purified, through several hydrophobic column steps and gel filtration, 
22,650-fold from human lymphocytes. Using information on its N-terminal and 
internal amino acid sequences, and the polymerase chain reaction method, we 
cloned a full-length cDNA for the enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence 
matched all amino acid sequences determined. The 3780 nucleotide sequence 
included 2007 nucleotides which encoded a single chain peptide of 669 amino acid 
residues with a 26 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and six potential 
asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. The galactocerebrosidase cDNA detected an 
about 4 kb mRNA band material in human cultured skin fibroblasts. A nonsense 
mutation was found at codon 369 (GAA-->TAA) in the coding sequence of cDNA 
amplified from cultured skin fibroblast mRNA from a patient with typical Krabbe 
disease."
8300589,"Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man. 
Biochemical studies were focused on the asexual, intraerythrocytic stages of P. 
falciparum, because of their role in the clinical phase of the disease and the 
possibility of propagation in a cell culture system. In this report, we describe 
the in-culture labeling of malarial glycolipids and the analysis of their 
hydrophilic moieties. They were identified as glycosylphosphatidylinositols 
(GPIs) by: 1) labeling with [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]ethanolamine 
and 2) sensitivity toward glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D, 
phospholipase A2, and nitrous acid. Malarial GPIs are shown to be unaffected by 
treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, regardless of 
prior treatment with mild base commonly used for inositol deacylation. Two 
candidates for putative GPI-anchor precursors to malarial membrane proteins with 
the structures ethanolamine-phosphate-6(Man alpha 1-2)Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 
1-6Man alpha 1-4 GlcN-PI (Pfg1 alpha) and ethanolamine-phosphate-6Man alpha

8300904,"We describe with a variant of the Golgi method a new type of neuron that is 
prominently represented in the granular layer of the mammalian 
vestibulocerebellum but is presently neglected in all major accounts on the 
cerebellum. These neurons, here termed unipolar brush cells, are intermediate in 
size between granule cells and Golgi cells. They typically have a thin and 
presumably myelinated axon, and a single and stubby dendrite whose tip forms a 
tightly packed group of branchlets resembling a paintbrush. The branchlets often 
intertwine with the digitiform claws of granule cell dendrites and are 
occasionally approached by Golgi cell dendrites, indicating that the unipolar 
brush cells may share the input of the other granular layer neurons. Branchlets 
of neighboring unipolar brush cells converging into the same neuropil island 
also occur. The brush-like tip of the unipolar cell engulfs one or two mossy 
fiber rosettes to form an extensive synapse that appears to close recurrent 
loops involving the vestibular nuclei. Positive feedback in these loops could 
help to explain several motor responses and drive mechanisms of extended 
duration that are controlled by the ventral cerebellum."
8301561,"To define the minimal structural requirements for cardiac activity of thyroid 
hormone analogs, a series of substituted phenols were screened for their ability 
to bind bacterially expressed thyroid hormone receptors. Compounds with binding 
activity then were tested for their ability to induce expression of alpha-myosin 
heavy chain mRNA in primary cultures of fetal rat cardiomyocytes, a sensitive 
marker for potential inotropic activity. 3,5-Diiodo-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic 
acid (DIHPA) was found to bind specifically to bacterially expressed alpha-1 and 
beta-1 thyroid hormone receptors (Kaff approximately 1 to 2 x 10(5) M-1) and to 
induce alpha-myosin heavy chain (EC50 approximately 5 x 10(-7)). To assess the 
effects of DIHPA on cardiac performance in vivo, hemodynamic measurements were 
made in three groups of hypothyroid rats treated for 5 days with s.c. doses of 
DIHPA (15 mg/100 g), L-thyroxine (T4, 1.5 micrograms/100 g) or saline. Compared 
to controls, DIHPA and T4 produced increases in heart rate, left ventricular 
+dP/dtmax, -dP/dtmax, and isovolumic relaxation. In isometric papillary muscles 
preparations, DIHPA and T4 shortened time-to-peak tension and time-from-peak 
tension to 50% decline as compared with saline-treated controls. Muscles from 
both drug-treatment groups showed similar responses to graded doses of 
isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) and to variations in Ca++ concentration of 
the muscle bath (0.3125 to 3.75 x 10(-3) M). Thus, DIHPA is a novel thyromimetic 
compound with effects on myocardial function similar to those observed with T4."
8302154,"Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting tumor originating from the adrenal 
medulla (up to 90%), or from the chromaffin tissue along the paravertebral 
sympathetic chain. The hallmark of pheochromocytoma is paroxysmal hypertension 
associated with diaphoresis, headache, tremulousness, and palpitations. The 
triad of diaphoresis, tachycardia, and headache in hypertensive patients is 
highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Other symptoms like flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, personality changes, and visual disturbances may however cast doubt on 
the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Death resulting from pheochromocytoma is 
usually due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or intracerebral 
hemorrhage. Although less than 0.1 percent of patients with hypertension have a 
pheochromocytoma, nearly 50 percent of the mortality with unsuspected 
pheochromocytoma occurred during anesthesia and surgery or parturition. Patients 
of unsuspected pheochromocytoma have higher risk for surgery, because some 
mandatory pre-op medical treatments might have been ignored. It is also a 
challenge to anesthesiologists to handle unsuspected hypertensive crisis during 
anesthesia and surgery. We presented such a case of unexpected Pheochromocytoma 
which was mis-diagnosed by the surgeon and was treated as an ordinary adrenal 
gland tumor and was scheduled for surgical operation. When the patient was 
undergoing excision of the tumor, manipulations of the tumor initiated an 
tremendous elevation of the blood pressure. Upon reviewing her history of 
normotension with visual disturbance, nausea and restlessness, she was immediate 
treated as with a pheochromocytoma. Appropriate managements were applied to 
control her abnormally high fluctuating blood pressure with success and with no 
complications or adverse effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8302226,"The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disease of unknown pathogenesis. 
Classical signs include recurrent facial palsy, lingua plicata and orofacial 
edema. The diagnosis is often difficult when all features are not present at the 
same time: in the literature complete triads occurred in 25-30% of the patients. 
We report a case of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome with classical triad of signs 
in a 13 year old boy. The pathology, clinical features and management of this 
disease are discussed: the possible role of food allergy or additives 
intolerance is also examined."
8302318,"BACKGROUND: Type II (tyrosinase-positive) oculocutaneous albinism is an 
autosomal recessive disorder that has recently been mapped to chromosome segment 
15q11-q13. The frequency of this disorder is greatly increased in patients with 
Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome, both of which involve deletions of chromosome 
15q. The P protein is a transmembrane polypeptide that may transport small 
molecules such as tyrosine, the precursor of melanin. The P gene is located in 
chromosome segment 15q11-q13.
METHODS: We studied the tyrosinase and P genes in three patients with type II 
oculocutaneous albinism, one of whom also had Prader-Willi syndrome, and in one 
patient with a milder syndrome known as autosomal recessive ocular albinism. 
Individual exons of these genes were amplified from the DNA of each patient by 
the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by simultaneous 
analyses of single-stranded conformation polymorphisms and heteroduplexes and 
subsequent DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Mutations of the P gene were identified in all four patients. These 
included one frame shift, three missense mutations that result in amino acid 
substitutions, and one mutation that affects RNA splicing. The patient with 
Prader-Willi syndrome plus albinism had a typical deletion of the paternal 
chromosome 15, rendering him hemizygous for a maternally inherited mutant allele 
of the P gene. The child with ocular albinism was heterozygous for two different 
mutations in the P gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the P gene are associated with a wide range of 
clinical phenotypes, including type II oculocutaneous albinism, albinism 
associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, and at least some cases of autosomal 
recessive ocular albinism."
8302780,"Contrary to what is observed in true hermaphroditism and in male 
pseudo-hermaphroditism, there is no erroneous transmission of the genetic 
gonadal differentiation programme in female pseudohermaphroditism. All that has 
happened is virilization of the urogenital sinus and external genitalia in a 
foetus exposed to exo- or endogenous androgens. In the absence of testis there 
is no production of anti-mullerian hormone, and for these reasons the uterus, 
the fallopian tubes and the vagina develop normally, whilst the wollfian ducts 
are regressed and there is no trace of male deep spermatic pathway. On the basis 
of recent acquisitions in biochemistry, endocrinology and embryogenesis, the 
authors compare the various degrees of virilization with the biochemical 
abnormalities."
8306565,"The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and use of flumazenil in 
benzodiazepine overdose, as well as in the management of other disease states, 
are reviewed. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to 
antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects 
of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. Flumazenil has been studied for 
a variety of indications, including as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose 
and for awakening of comatose patients, reversal of sedation after surgery and 
in critically ill patients, and management of hepatic encephalopathy. It 
improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; 
however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so 
repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic 
efficacy. It appears to be effective in reversing sedation induced by midazolam 
or diazepam, and case reports suggest that it is useful in awakening comatose 
patients, although its clinical utility is questionable. Flumazenil has proved 
useful in reversing conscious sedation in critically ill patients, although 
response may be dose dependent. Animal models indicate that flumazenil is of 
some benefit in hepatic encephalopathy, but until well-designed clinical trials 
are conducted, hepatic encephalopathy must be considered an investigational 
indication for flumazenil. Adverse reactions include CNS manifestations, 
resedation, cardiovascular effects, seizures, and alterations in intracranial 
pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Hepatic dysfunction results in a 
substantial change in the pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil; therefore, 
dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction or in 
those receiving medications that alter flumazenil metabolism. Flumazenil has 
been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone 
or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used 
when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. It may be beneficial after 
surgery when benzodiazepines have been used as part of anesthesia and after a 
diagnostic or surgical procedure when assessment of CNS function is necessary."
8307567,"The transient axonal glycoprotein (TAG-1) is a cell adhesion molecule that 
promotes neurite outgrowth and belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. We 
have isolated cDNAs encoding TAX1, the human homologue of TAG-1. Human TAX1 
shows a high degree of homology to rat TAX1 and less to its chick counterpart, 
axonin-1, with 91 and 75% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. The 
numbers of immunoglobulin (IgC2) domains and fibronectin repeats present in 
TAG-1 are conserved among the three species. The highest degree of conservation 
occurs in the second IgC2 domain (98% with the rat and 82% with the chick). The 
human homologue also contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence and a 
C-terminal hydrophobic sequence, suggestive of linkage to the cell membrane via 
phosphatidylinositol. In addition, the two mammalian TAG-1 proteins share the 
RGD tripeptide, a motif known to mediate recognition of fibronectin by 
integrins. In situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes maps the TAX1 
gene encoding human TAG-1 to a single location on chromosome 1q32."
8312036,"BACKGROUND: Therapy to enhance cholinergic function in the brain is under 
evaluation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Tetrahydroaminoacridine 
(tacrine) has recently received a product licence in the United States of 
America for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and the licence application in 
the United Kingdom will shortly be reviewed. It is therefore possible that this 
drug will become available for use in the UK in due course. There will then be a 
need for screening procedures for a large number of elderly patients to decide 
whether or not they have dementia and, if so, whether it is the result of 
Alzheimer's disease and is suitable for treatment with the new drug.
METHOD: A total of 246 patients aged 75 years or over in two general practices 
in Bristol were assessed to investigate the potential workload such screening 
would engender. Three different assessment schedules for the diagnosis of 
dementia were compared--the mini-mental state examination, the Kew test, and the 
abbreviated mental test score.
RESULTS: None of the assessment schedules was found to be particularly onerous, 
with median times for administration of five, three and two minutes, 
respectively. A score of 23 or less on the mini-mental state examination was 
taken as the main cut-off point for further evaluation. Sixty six patients 
obtained this score--in 25 the low score reflected factors other than dementia, 
and 11 others declined further assessment. Of the remaining 30 patients only 
four had probable Alzheimer's disease at an appropriate level of severity for 
treatment, and lived with a carer who could ensure compliance and monitor side 
effects. Two of these patients were receiving conflicting medical treatment and 
a third declined therapy, leaving only one person for whom treatment could be 
prescribed.
CONCLUSION: It seems likely that of those medically suitable for treatment, it 
may not be possible to prescribe tacrine for an appreciable proportion. 
Nevertheless, all potential patients should be screened as the procedures 
involved are not onerous and at least some of those found suitable for treatment 
are likely to benefit from this new approach."
8312968,"RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase is a dynamic process. Techniques that 
allow the isolation of active elongation complexes have enabled investigators to 
describe individual steps in the polymerization of RNA chains. This article will 
describe recent studies of elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II). At least 
four types of blockage to chain elongation can be overcome by elongation factor 
SII: (a) naturally occurring ""arrest"" sequences, (b) DNA-bound protein, (c) 
drugs bound in the DNA minor groove, and (d) chain-terminating substrates 
incorporated into the RNA chain. SII binds to RNA polymerase II and stimulates a 
ribonuclease activity that shortens nascent transcripts from their 3' ends. This 
RNA cleavage is required for chain elongation from some template positions. As a 
result, the pol II elongation complex can repeatedly shorten and reextend the 
nascent RNA chain in a process we refer to as cleavage-resynthesis. Hence, 
assembly of large RNAs does not necessarily proceed in a direct manner. The 
ability to shorten and reextend nascent RNAs means that a transcription 
impediment through which only half the enzyme molecules can proceed per 
encounter, can be overcome by 99% of the molecules after six iterations of 
cleavage-resynthesis. Surprisingly, the boundaries of the elongation complex do 
not move upstream after RNA cleavage. The physico-chemical alterations in the 
elongation complex that accompany RNA cleavage and permit renewed chain 
elongation are not yet understood."
8315464,"Although meningiomas are known to be induced by low doses of cranial 
irradiation, such as those given to treat tinea capitis, little experience has 
been reported on the induction of meningiomas by high-dose cranial irradiation. 
The authors describe a series of 10 patients with meningiomas and a previous 
history of high-dose radiation therapy, usually given for a primary brain tumor. 
Of the 10 patients, eight were female, three had multiple meningiomas, and the 
majority had other stigmata of previous radiation therapy. Eight meningiomas 
were examined pathologically and one-half were classified as either aggressive 
or atypical, or were noted to have a high bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. The 
average time from radiation therapy to diagnosis of a meningioma was 24 years 
(range 5 to 40 years), a shorter interval than that previously reported for 
meningiomas induced by lower doses of irradiation. Within this series, patient 
age at irradiation was significantly correlated with tumor latency; individuals 
who were younger at the time of radiation therapy had a shorter time to 
meningioma formation. The latency of meningioma formation is therefore 
influenced by both the radiation dose and the age of the patient at irradiation."
8320168,"Melanocytic tumors as well as multiple neurofibromas were induced in 35 of 88 
Syrian golden hamsters by a single s.c. administration of 100 mg/kg of 
N-nitroso-N-ethylurea applied 48 h after birth. The lesions were all observed 
proliferating in the dermis and demonstrated melanosomes and premelanosomes. 
High cellularity, nuclear atypia and transplantability of the tumors in outbred 
hamsters suggested a malignant nature. Some of the melanomas were 
morphologically heterogenous and contained Schwann-like cells as minor 
components. In addition, transplantation of the melanomas resulted in increased 
schwannian differentiation even for primary tumors which did not contain any 
Schwann-like cell foci. One of the transplanted melanomas mimicked malignant 
peripheral nervous tumor. Schwannian differentiation was also proved by the fact 
that glial fibrillary acidic protein was positive in 22.2% of the cases. The 
present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural 
crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and 
Schwann cells."
8321243,"The AT-rich element MEF-2 plays an important role in the maintenance of the 
muscle-specific expression of a number of cardiac and skeletal muscle genes. In 
the MLC-2 gene, an AT-rich element (HF-1b) which contains a consensus MEF-2 site 
is required for cardiac tissue-specific expression. The present study reports 
the isolation and characterization of a cDNA which encodes a novel C2H2 zinc 
finger (HF-1b) that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the HF-1b/MEF-2 site 
in the MLC-2 promoter. A number of independent criteria suggest that this HF-1b 
zinc finger protein is a component of the endogenous HF-1b/MEF-2 binding 
activity in cardiac muscle cells and that it can serve as a transcriptional 
activator of the MLC-2 promoter in transient assays. These studies suggest that, 
in addition to the previously reported RSRF proteins, structurally divergent 
transcriptional factors can bind to MEF-2-like sites in muscle promoters. These 
results underscore the complexity of the regulation of the muscle gene program 
via these AT-rich elements in cardiac and skeletal muscle."

karyotype of tumour cells with translocations of t(11;22)(q24;q12) and 
der(4)t(2;4)(q24;q35). The observed t(11;22)(q24;q12) is not only a unique 
characteristic of all cytogenetically analyzed Askin's tumours but it also 
occurs in 92-100% of peripheral neuroepithelioma and of Ewing's sarcoma, 
irrespective of its osseous or extraosseous localization. This genetical 
similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's 
tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic 
variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal 
tumour."
8322324,"Echocardiographic and clinical evaluation was undertaken in 33 adult patients 
with Marfan syndrome. Cardiovascular manifestations were found in 32 (97%), 
mitral valve prolapse in 23 (70%) and dilated aortic root (> or = 21 mm/m2) in 
26 patients (79%). The aortic root diameter was 58-85 mm in six patients with 
proximal aortic dissection, 57-76 mm in four patients undergoing elective 
surgery and 35-49 mm in conservatively treated patients. Average age at surgery 
was 28 years. Echocardiography with Doppler is the method of choice for 
diagnosis and control of patients with Marfan syndrome."

8325717,"The purpose of the present study was to compare endocrine parameters reflecting 
reproductive function and metabolism in ten amenorrheic (AR) and eumenorrheic 
(ER) adolescent female runners and seven untrained controls (SE). Additionally, 
responses to diagnostic criteria for eating disorders (DSM-III) were compared 
among groups. AR ran more miles/day and consumed fewer kcal/d to support energy 
expenditure compared to ER (p < 0.05). Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, 
luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and 
triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. AR 
indicated they were very concerned about their weight and were fearful of 
gaining fat mass. Female adolescents who participate in strenuous training 
exhibit alterations in hormone levels reflecting reproductive function and 
metabolism."
8327500,"We have examined whether dissociation of the histone octamer is required for 
elongation of RNA transcripts through arrays of nucleosome cores in vitro. 
Control or dimethyl suberimidate-crosslinked histone octamers were reconstituted 
onto supercoiled, closed circular pT207-18 DNA, which contains tandemly repeated 
207-base-pair (bp) 5S rDNA nucleosome positioning sequences inserted between the 
T7 and SP6 transcription promoters of pGEM-3Z. Double label transcription 
experiments showed that there was little or no effect of extensive crosslinking 
of the histone octamers on transcription initiation and elongation by T7 RNA 
polymerase in vitro. Continuous regularly spaced linear arrays of either 
crosslinked or control nucleosome cores were obtained by digesting reconstituted 
nucleosomal pT207-18 templates with Dra I, a site that is protected from 
digestion by the presence of positioned nucleosome cores in the 207-pb sequence. 
After in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, an RNA ladder with 
207-nucleotide spacing was obtained from templates reconstituted both with 
crosslinked and with control histone octamers, demonstrating clearly that 
neither partial nor complete dissociation of the histone octamer is essential 
for transcription elongation through arrays of nucleosome cores in vitro."
8333797,"Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may 
experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we 
examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic 
significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid 
abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential 
relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results 
indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse 
triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced 
congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently 
a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms 
involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism."
8333798,"In heart failure, cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body 
for oxygen delivery. Available data suggest that alterations in thyroid hormone 
metabolism may contribute to defective myocardial performance. Accordingly, 
thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance 
might be useful in the treatment of heart failure and has been studied. 
Experimental and theoretical results of these studies are reviewed and indicate 
that thyroid hormone increases cardiac output by a combination of effects on the 
heart and peripheral circulation, specifically by increasing myocardial 
contractile performance and decreasing venous compliance. In the rat 
postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses of thyroxine 
(1.5 micrograms/100 g) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response, 
including an increase in rate of change of left ventricular pressure and a 
decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These changes could be 
attributed to conversion to triiodothyronine, the active intracellular form of 
thyroid hormone. When treatment with thyroxine was continued at the same or 
higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10 to 12 days, heart rate increased 
and improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was not sustained. 
More favorable results were obtained with 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid, a 
cardiotonic thyroid hormone analogue administered at doses of 375 microgram/100 
g, given in combination with captopril. Thus, triiodothyronine or a thyroid 
hormone analogue may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of 
heart failure."
8336812,"Intraosseous tumor was found in a 63 year old male patient with lung cancer 
during metastatic work-up study. Plain skull X-ray film showed a large 
osteolytic lesion in the left temporo-parietal bone. Bone and Ga scintigrams 
revealed an increased activity in this lesion. CT scan demonstrated an isodense 
lentiform configuration, which was homogeneously enhanced with contrast medium. 
It was iso-intense in T1, and high-intense in T2 and proton weighted MR images. 
The tumor was removed en bloc with surrounding normal bone. The attached dura 
was markedly thickened, but there was no tumor infiltration. Histological 
diagnosis was transitional meningioma with psammoma body. Postoperatively he was 
transferred back to Okinawa Hospital and right lower lobectomy was performed for 
the lung tumor. Histological diagnosis was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
We examined immunohistochemically p53 protein expression, but p53 immunoactivity 
was observed in neither tumor. Multiple neoplasms associated with brain tumor 
are relatively rare, but the incidence will increase in the future as the 
diagnostic work-up develops. Pathological diagnosis will give us the decisive 
opportunity for proper treatment. It is to be stressed that, in multiple 
neoplasms, care should be taken to avoid misdiagnosis of metastasis."
8336953,"Mal de debarquement syndrome is defined by a persistent sensation of rocking and

short-lived phenomenon. The need for extensive evaluations may be avoided by an 
awareness of this entity."
8338342,"Regional and global metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRGlc and GMR) were estimated 
using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography in 3 patients 
with Filipino X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (lubag). In all 3 patients a 
selective reduction in normalized striatal glucose metabolism (rCMRGlc/GMR) was 
observed compared with 15 normal volunteer subjects. Presynaptic nigrostriatal 
function was assessed in these patients using [18F]fluorodopa and positron 
emission tomography. Striatal rate constants for [18F]flurodopa uptake were 
found to be in the normal range in all 3 patients with lubag. These findings 
suggest that the extrapyramidal manifestations of lubag are metabolically 
localized to the striatum and that clinical parkinsonism in these patients may 
be secondary to extranigral factors."
8339930,"The mammalian high mobility group proteins HMG1 and HMG2 are abundant, 
chromatin-associated proteins whose cellular function is not known. In this 
study we show that these proteins can substitute for the prokaryotic DNA-bending 
protein HU in promoting the assembly of the Hin invertasome, an intermediate 
structure in Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion. Formation of this complex 
requires the assembly of the Hin recombinase, the Fis protein, and three 
cis-acting DNA sites, necessitating the looping of intervening DNA segments. 
Invertasome assembly is strongly stimulated by HU or HMG proteins when one of 
these segments is shorter than 104 bp. By use of ligase-mediated circularization 
assays, we demonstrate that HMG1 and HMG2 can bend DNA extremely efficiently, 
forming circles as small as 66 bp, and even 59-bp circles at high HMG protein 
concentrations. In both invertasome assembly and circularization assays, 
substrates active in the presence of HMG1 contain one less helical turn of DNA 
compared with substrates active in the presence of HU protein. Analysis of 
different domains of HMG1 generated by partial proteolytic digestion indicate 
that DNA-binding domain B is sufficient for both bending and invertasome 
assembly. We suggest that an important biological function of HMG1 and HMG2 is 
to facilitate cooperative interactions between cis-acting proteins by promoting 
DNA flexibility. A general role for HMG1 and HMG2 in chromatin structure is also 
suggested by their ability to wrap DNA duplexes into highly compact forms."
8340096,"Two groups of neonates, 30 cases with hyperbilirubinemia (307.8 +/- 99.86 
mumol/L) and 30 normal newborns (control group with bilirubin 80.37 +/- 35.74 
mumol/L), were evaluated with Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and 
followed up at the age of 2 months and 5 months. All cases in the two groups 
were evaluated with NBAS at ages of 2-3 days, 12-14 days and 26-28 days. The 
results showed that there were statistically significant differences between the 
two groups in the aspects of attention and social responsiveness, the ability to 
modulate state of consciousness, the motor integrity and the reflexes. We also 
found that while the level of bilirubin was below 205.2 mumol/L, there was no 
correlation between the level of bilirubin and NBAS (r = -0.095, P > 0.02), but 
when bilirubin was at or above the level of 205.2 mumol/L, there was significant 
negative correlation (r = -0.53, P < 0.001) between the two. The follow-up 
revealed that 9 of 23 jaundiced infants had abnormal auditory reactions or 
abnormal muscle tonus at the age of 2 months; 8 of the 9 infants recovered, but 
1 still had abnormal muscle tonus by the age of 5 months. The study suggests 
that hyperbilirubinemia above the level of 205.2 mumol/L would affect neonatal 
behavior and the greater the severity of jaundice, the more significant the 
influence on neonatal behavior. The effects on some jaundiced infants may last 5 
months or more. NBAS is a valuable scale for early detection of mild brain 
dysfunctions which are less obvious on clinical examination."
8341310,"Lubag is an x-linked recessive dystonia parkinsonism that affects Filipino men 
originating principally from the Panay Island. Linkage analysis has confirmed 
the mode of inheritance and localized the disease gene to the proximal long arm 
of the x-chromosome. We studied the brain of a 34 year old Filipino man affected 
with lubag. He developed truncal dystonia at age 30, which subsequently 
generalized. With disease progression, he also presented with parkinsonism 
including, rigidity, bradykinesia, and impaired balance. His symptoms were 
largely unaffected by medication and, at age 34, he underwent a right 
cryothalamotomy. He died suddenly 2 days after the procedure. The principal 
neuropathological findings were neuronal loss and a multifocal mosaic pattern of 
astrocytosis restricted to the caudate and lateral putamen. Similar findings 
have been reported in two other men with dystonia--one Filipino and the other 
non-Filipino. The similar pathology of the two Filipino men suggests that this 
is the pathology of lubag. Recognition of this pathology in a non-Filipino man 
suggests that the mutation causing lubag may not be restricted to the Filipino 
population."
8341988,"Helicobacter pylori is the major causal factor in chronic gastritis. Its 
acquisition leads to a chronic, usually lifelong, inflammation of the gastric 
mucosa, which may gradually progress to atrophy (with intestinal metaplasia) in 
a significant proportion of infected individuals. This progression is probably 
multifactorial, being influenced by genetic or environmental factors in addition 
to H. pylori infection. The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is 
closely associated with H. pylori gastritis and its subsequent atrophic sequelae 
(atrophic gastritis). H. pylori-induced gastritis is an important risk factor in 
the multifactorial aetiology of these diseases. It causes a cascade of reactions 
that damage the gastric mucosa and epithelium in various ways. The specific 
mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Some are probably bacterium-related 
reactions, which are influenced by various virulence factors, and others are 
consequences of the mucosal inflammation and atrophy. The risk of peptic ulcer 
and gastric cancer in patients with H. pylori gastritis can be summarized as 
follows: i) the risk of both peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is low in 
individuals with a normal stomach; ii) the risk of peptic ulcer is approximately 
ten times higher and the risk of gastric cancer approximately twice as high in 
patients with non-atrophic H. pylori-positive gastritis as in those with a 
normal stomach; iii) these risks are further increased (twofold to threefold) 
when there is antral atrophy; whereas iv) in the presence of corpus atrophy the 
risk of gastric cancer remains high, but that of peptic ulcer decreases 
gradually to zero with increasing severity of corpus atrophy."
8344267,"We investigated the requirements for selenocysteine insertion at single or 
multiple UGA codons in eukaryotic selenoproteins. Two functional SECIS elements 
were identified in the 3' untranslated region of the rat selenoprotein P mRNA, 
with predicted stem-loops and critical nucleotides similar to those in the SECIS 
elements in the type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase (5'DI) and glutathione 
peroxidase selenoprotein mRNAs. Site-directed mutational analyses of three SECIS 
elements confirmed that conserved nucleotides in the loop and in unpaired 
regions of the stem are critical for activity. This indicates that multiple 
contact sites are required for SECIS function. Stop codon function at any of 
five out-of-context UGA codons in the 5'DI mRNA was suppressed by SECIS elements 
from the 5'DI or selenoprotein P genes linked downstream. Thus, the presence of 
SECIS elements in eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs permits complete flexibility in 
UGA codon position."
8344905,"R-phycoerythrin is the major light-harvesting pigment protein of most red algal 
phycobilisomes. It is composed of three pigmented polypeptide subunits, the 
alpha, beta, and gamma. While alpha and beta phycoerythrin subunits are each 
unique in the red alga Aglaothamnion neglectum, there are two different gamma 
subunits with distinct molecular masses. Both gamma subunits are pigmented by 
virtue of covalently attached linear tetrapyrroles. The amino acid sequence of 
one of the gamma subunits, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA 
clone, has no significant similarity to any known sequence in the data bases. 
This result is surprising, since the gamma subunit of phycoerythrin is thought 
to have a function that is similar to cyanobacterial linker polypeptides. The A. 
neglectum gamma subunit is synthesized as a 36-kDa precursor protein that is 
processed at the amino terminus to yield a 33-kDa mature protein. The 
amino-terminal extension was able to direct the pea small subunit of Rubisco 
into isolated pea chloroplasts. This result suggests that red algae transport 
proteins into the plastid by a mechanism similar to that of higher plants. There 
are significant changes in levels of mRNA encoding the gamma 33 subunit when A. 
neglectum is grown under different conditions of illumination and in 
nitrogen-deficient medium. These changes parallel those previously observed for 
transcripts encoding the alpha and beta phycoerythrin subunits. Hence, there may 
be coordinated expression of nuclear and plastid-encoded phycoerythrin subunit 
genes."
8345811,"This study was designed to examine the involvement of thyroid hormone in the 
release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from the heart. We measured plasma 
immunoreactive BNP (ir-BNP) concentrations in patients with untreated 
hyperthyroidism. We also measured BNP values in experimental rats with 
hyperthyroidism induced by thyroxine (T4) and in rats with hypothyroidism 
induced by propylthiouracil (PTU). The in vitro effects of triiodothyronine (T3) 
and T4 on the release of BNP were examined in newborn rat atrial and ventricular 
myocytes in primary culture. Plasma BNP levels were increased in hyperthyroid 
patients compared with normal control subjects. Plasma BNP levels were increased 
in hyperthyroid rats and decreased in hypothyroid rats compared with euthyroid 
rats. Plasma BNP level was correlated with serum T4 level in hyperthyroid 
patients and hyperthyroid rats. A major component of ir-BNP in plasma from 
hyperthyroid patients was human BNP-32 and that in plasma from hyperthyroid rats 
was rat BNP-45. T4 and T3 stimulated release of ir-BNP from both cultured atrial 
and ventricular myocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma BNP concentration is 
frequently increased in hyperthyroidism, and thyroid hormone may regulate BNP 
release from both atrial and ventricular myocytes."
8347064,"Eighteen boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were assessed for their 
ability to perform tasks involving wrist and hand function. Each subject was 
assessed using the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, range of motion measurements, 
and muscle strength tests. Writing and simulated page turning were performed 
successfully by boys in all age groups. Boys over age 15 had difficulty 
completing simulated feeding and picking up large and small objects. The muscle 
strength of the wrist extensors and the radial deviation range of motion at the 
wrist were found to be strongly correlated with six of the seven tasks assessed. 
These two clinical assessments appear to be good indicators of overall wrist and 
hand function. Life expectancy with DMD is increasing with advances in 
respiratory care making preservation of wrist and hand function, the major 
activity remaining with advanced disease, increasingly important."
8389441,"A plant cytosine methyltransferase cDNA was isolated using degenerate 
oligonucleotides, based on homology between prokaryote and mouse 
methyltransferases, and PCR to amplify a short fragment of a methyltransferase 
gene. A fragment of the predicted size was amplified from genomic DNA from 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Overlapping cDNA clones, some with homology to the PCR 
amplified fragment, were identified and sequenced. The assembled nucleic acid 
sequence is 4720 bp and encodes a protein of 1534 amino acids which has 
significant homology to prokaryote and mammalian cytosine methyltransferases. 
Like mammalian methylases, this enzyme has a C terminal methyltransferase domain 
linked to a second larger domain. The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten 
conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytosine-5 methyltransferases and 
shows 50% homology to the murine enzyme in the methyltransferase domain. The 
amino terminal domain is only 24% homologous to the murine enzyme and lacks the 
zinc binding region that has been found in methyltransferases from both mouse 
and man. In contrast to mouse where a single methyltransferase gene has been 
identified, a small multigene family with homology to the region amplified in 
PCR has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana."
8389458,"The function of a TATA element in RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) III transcription 
of a naturally TATA-containing U6 snRNA gene and a naturally TATA-less tRNA gene 
was probed by transcription and Ty3 transposition analyses. Deletion of the TATA 
box from a U6 minigene did not abolish transcription and Ty3 integration but 
changed the positions of initiation and insertion. Insertion of the U6 TATA box 
at three positions upstream of the TATA-less SUP2 tRNA(Tyr) gene resulted in 
novel transcription initiation and Ty3 integration patterns that depended upon 
position of the insertion. Nevertheless, the predominant tRNA gene initiation 
sites were not affected by insertion of the TATA sequence and remained at a 
fixed distance from the internal box A promoter element. Insertions of the TATA 
box upstream of a SUP2 box A mutant affected the level of transcription and 
restricted the use of upstream start sites, but they neither enhanced the use of 
TATA-dependent initiation sites nor restored expression to the level of the 
wild-type gene. We conclude that (i) the U6 TATA box is essential in vivo for 
correct initiation but not for transcription, (ii) a TATA box does not 
compensate for a weak box A sequence and so cannot perform equivalently, and 
(iii) the TATA-binding protein, and probably components of transcription factor 
IIIB, are present on the target at the time of Ty3 integration."
8389710,"A controversy persists as to whether cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases 
plasma levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thereby justifying peri-operative 
administration of T3 to improve haemodynamic recovery. To examine the effects of 
T3 therapy on post-CPB haemodynamics and to determine whether the potential 
inotropic effects of T3 are mediated by an increase in beta-adrenergic 
responsiveness, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study was performed in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. T3 or 
placebo solution (10 patients in each group) was given intravenously at the time 
of aortic unclamping and 4, 8, 12 and 20 h thereafter. End points included (1) 
thyroid hormone levels measured by radioimmunoassay (2) standard haemodynamic 
parameters (3) the density of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors measured by a 
radioligand (125I-iodocyanopindolol) binding technique. Post-CPB values (cross 
clamp removal) of T3 (pg.ml-1) were not significantly decreased compared with 
pre-CPB values: 3.3 +/- 0.2 vs 3.1 +/- 0.2 in controls and 3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 3.7 
+/- 0.6 in T3-treated patients, respectively. The haemodynamic parameters were 
no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise, 
density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly 
different from pre-operative values in either group. Thus, there seems to be no 
sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart 
procedures."

8394641,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural mesothelioma in rural Turkey frequently results 
from environmental exposure to tremolite asbestos or fibrous zeolite (erionite). 
The aim of this study was to determine the CT features of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma in patients exposed to asbestos or erionite.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 84 patients with proved malignant pleural 
mesothelioma were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty patients (24%) had been 
exposed to erionite and 64 patients (76%) had been exposed to asbestos. The CT 
scans were interpreted by seven observers who did not know the clinical or 
pathologic findings.
RESULTS: CT scans showed either unilateral pleural thickening or pleural 
nodules/masses in all patients. Pleural nodules were present in 25 patients 
(30%) and pleural masses in 44 patients (52%). Pleural effusion was found in 61 
patients (73%), mediastinal pleural involvement in 78 (93%), pleural 
calcifications in 52 (62%), involvement of the interlobar fissures in 64 (76%), 
and volume contraction in 61 (73%). Reduced size of the hemithorax was 
significantly correlated with chest wall involvement. On the basis of CT 
findings, the preassigned staging was changed in 21 patients (25%), including 
44% of the patients with disease that had been classified as stage I. CT 
findings were not significantly different between the patients exposed to 
erionite and those exposed to asbestos.
CONCLUSION: The most common CT findings in cases of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma were unilateral pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses with 
or without effusion. CT provided valuable information on the extent of the 
disease, which was important for staging. Although the CT features are not 
pathognomonic, they provide valuable clues to the diagnosis in patients who have 
been exposed to mineral fibers."
8396675,"Sequence motifs within the nonstructural protein NS3 of members of the 
Flaviviridae family suggest that this protein possesses nucleoside 
triphosphatase (NTPase) and RNA helicase activity. The RNA-stimulated NTPase 
activity of this protein from prototypic members of the Pestivirus and 
Flavivirus genera has recently been established and enzymologically 
characterized. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the NS3 protein from a 
member of the third genus of Flaviviridae, human hepatitis C virus (HCV), also 
possesses a polynucleotide-stimulated NTPase activity. Characterization of the 
purified HCV NTPase activity showed that it exhibited reaction condition optima 
with respect to pH, MgCl2, and salt identical to those of the representative 
pestivirus and flavivirus enzymes. However, each NTPase also possessed several 
unique properties when compared with one another. Notably, the profile of 
polynucleotide stimulation of the NTPase activity was distinct for the three 
enzymes. The HCV NTPase was the only one whose activity was significantly 
enhanced by a deoxyribopolynucleotide. Additional distinguishing features among 
the three enzymes relating to the kinetic properties of their NTPase activities 
are discussed. These studies provide a foundation for investigation of the 
putative RNA helicase activity of these proteins and for further study of the 
role of the NS3 proteins of members of the Flaviviridae in the replication cycle 
of these viruses."
8397367,"The loss of the tumor-suppressor activity of p53, either by mutation or by 
interaction with the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein, is considered to be 
an important mechanism in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. We have studied 
the cytological distribution of these proteins in human cervical carcinoma cell 
lines using polyclonal anti-p53 and monoclonal anti-E6 antibodies. The antibody 
specificity was confirmed by immunoblot and immunocompetition analyses. The 
intracellular localization of p53 and E6 was detected using the techniques of 
conventional and three-dimensional confocal microscopy. In the HPV-18 or -16 
integrated cell lines, HeLa, CaSki and SiHa, viral oncoprotein E6 and endogenous 
tumor-suppressor protein, p53, were observed by immunofluorescence in the 
cytoplasm; p53 also had a weak punctate staining in the nuclei of HeLa and CaSki 
cells. In the HPV-negative cervical carcinoma cell lines, C-33A and HT-3, which 
have mutated p53, p53 was localized predominantly to the nucleus, with C-33A 
cells having elevated levels of p53 compared with the other cell lines. High 
spatial resolution imaging, using confocal microscopy, was performed on the 
cells after double fluorescence staining for p53 (fluorescein) and E6 
(rhodamine). The images showed that both p53 and E6 had similar cytoplasmic 
distributions, which implied that these two proteins may exist as a cytoplasmic 
complex. To substantiate this implication, fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer microscopy was performed, which provided direct evidence of a close 
association between p53 and E6 within individual HeLa cells. The results from 
this study support the theory that p53 protein binds HPV-16/18 E6 protein in the 
cell cytoplasm, thus preventing p53 from exerting its tumor-suppressor function 
in the nucleus. Hence, inactivation of wild-type p53 by p53-E6 complex formation 
in cervical cancer may be a critical step in malignant transformation."
8397511,"Pyrenemethyl laurate (PMLes), a fluorogenic substrate for determining in vitro 
lipase activity [Nègre, Salvayre, Dagan and Gatt (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 
1006, 84-88], has been administered to cultured lymphoblastoid cells from normal 
subjects and from a patient affected with Wolman disease, which is characterized 
by a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase. The intracellular degradation of PMLes 
was dependent on the mode of administration of the substrate into the cells, and 
occurred by two separate pathways involving lysosomal and extra-lysosomal 
hydrolases. PMLes incorporated into LDL was taken up by normal lymphoblastoid 
cells through the apolipoprotein-B/E-receptor-mediated pathway and degraded in 
the lysosomal compartment, as suggested by the degradation block in Wolman 
cells. In contrast, when PMLes dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulphoxide was added 
directly to the culture medium, its hydrolysis was similar in lymphoblastoid 
cells from controls and from patients affected with Wolman disease, neutral 
lipid storage disease or familial hypercholesterolaemia. This suggested that the 
administered PMLes was degraded by a non-lysosomal enzyme which is not deficient 
in Wolman cells. This enzyme also differs from the neutral lipase system which 
is deficient in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with neutral lipid storage 
disease. When pyrenemethanol was administered directly to the cell culture, it 
was only poorly acylated and was rapidly released into the culture medium. These 
results and the fluorescence properties of PMLes ('monomeric' emission in a 
hydrophobic environment and 'excimeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) 
and pyrenemethanol ('monomeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) allowed 
us to design a 'direct reading' procedure by monitoring (without any lipid 
extraction) the fluorescence of intact living cells and that of the culture 
medium during pulse-chase experiments. This method allowed the direct evaluation 
of the time course of in situ degradation of PMLes. In pulse-chase experiments 
with LDL-PMLes, the fluorescence of normal cells decreased relatively rapidly 
with time whereas the fluorescence of the culture medium increased 
concomitantly. With Wolman cells, the cellular fluorescence decreased only very 
slightly, whereas that of the culture medium remained at the basal level; this 
demonstrates the catabolic block in intact living cells from patients with 
Wolman disease. In vitro degradation of PMLes indicated the existence of two 
PMLes-degrading enzymes in lymphoblastoid cell homogenates: one is the acid 
lipase which is involved in PMLes degradation in the lysosomal compartment (and 
is deficient in Wolman cells), while the second is a cytoplasmic enzyme (not

kilodalton precursor. The p105 carboxyl terminus, which contains ankyrin-like 
repeats, a feature of I kappa B molecules, regulates the cytoplasmic retention 
of p105 and inhibits DNA binding by the precursor. Here, we describe an I kappa 
B protein identical to the carboxyl-terminal region of p105. Probes spanning the 
COOH terminus but not the rel homology domain of p105 hybridize to a distinct 
2.6-kilobase mRNA expressed in a wide range of murine tissues. The nucleotide 
sequence of complementary DNA clones for this transcript, in vitro translation, 
and immune precipitation of metabolically labeled cell lysates establish that it 
encodes a 70 kilodalton protein that corresponds to the COOH-terminal 607 amino 
acids of p105. p70 suppresses p65 and p75c-rel mediated transactivation of 
reporter genes under the control of NF-kappa B elements and in vitro can prevent 
DNA binding of p50 and p75c-rel homodimers to NF-kappa B sites. The ability of 
p70 to stably associate with p49 and p65 in vitro, but not inhibit DNA binding 
by these proteins, suggests that the specific inhibitory properties of this I 
kappa B may reflect its relative affinity for different rel targets. p70 
phosphorylated by protein kinase A fails to inhibit DNA binding by p50 or the 
c-rel protein, and sequencing of radiolabeled p70 tryptic phosphopeptides 
establishes that protein kinase A phosphorylates serine residue 576 of p70. This 
finding suggests that the inhibitory activity of p70 can be regulated by 
signaling via the adenylate cyclase pathway."
8399135,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against E2, a 32-kDa transmembrane protein 
encoded by the MIC2 gene located in the pseudoautosomal region, induce a 
transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and, to a lesser extent, 
phosphatidylethanolamine in human thymocytes and a Jurkat T lymphocytes. The 
translocation of phosphatidylserine has been evidenced by using either 
derivatization of anionic phospholipids with trinitrobenzenesulfonate (TNBS) or 
cytofluorimetry after labeling of cells with antiphosphatidylserine antibodies. 
The perturbation of membrane phospholipids induced by anti-E2 mAbs was further 
evidenced by labeling the cells with merocyanine 540. The specificity of 
anti-E2-induced perturbations of membrane asymmetry was tested by using a number 
of mAbs able to activate T cells, including CD3 and CD2. The results strongly 
suggest that anti-E2-induced changes in PtdSer are related to cell aggregation 
since the same mAbs specifically induce the aggregation of both thymocytes and 
Jurkat cells and since the E2 molecule has been previously implicated in the 
adhesive properties of human T cells with erythrocytes."
8399327,"Galactocerebrosidase (GALC, EC 3.2.1.46) was purified from human urine by a 
series of hydrophobic affinity column chromatography steps. The activity was 
enriched 176,000-fold from concentrated urine by only four columns, including 
octyl Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, butyl Sepharose and ethyl-agarose. The overall 
recovery was about 20% but only low amounts were obtained due to its low 
abundance. The estimated final specific activities of several batches were 
between 1 and 2 mmol/h per mg protein. The final purified fractions were 
essentially free of other lysosomal enzyme activities. The most pure fractions 
showed a series of bands between 50 and 53 kDa on sodium 
dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were determined to have 
identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. In addition, gel filtration of 
partially purified GALC after disassociation showed one peak of activity 
estimated to have a molecular mass near 50 kDa. GALC was also purified from 
human brain and human placenta using the same methods demonstrating the 
usefulness of this procedure in obtaining GALC from solid human tissues. In 
addition to the bands migrating near 50 kDa from urine, there were also bands at 
80 kDa and 30 kDa in some preparations. By N-terminal sequencing and the use of 
antipeptide antibodies, the 80 kDa band was demonstrated to have the same 
N-terminal amino acids as the 50-53 kDa bands. The 30 kDa band had a unique 
sequence. The relationship between the different molecular weight species 
remains to be determined. The purification of GALC and the securing of amino 
acid sequence information will aid in the cloning of the GALC gene. This enzyme 
is deficient in human patients with Krabbe disease and several animal species."
8401580,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a frequent congenital disorder (1 in 5,000 
newborns) of unknown origin characterized by the absence of parasympathetic 
intrinsic ganglion cells of the hindgut. Taking advantage of a proximal deletion 
of chromosome 10q (del 10q11.2-q21.2) in a patient with total colonic 
aganglionosis, and of a high-density genetic map of microsatellite DNA markers, 
we performed genetic linkage analysis in 15 non-syndromic long-segment and 
short-segment HSCR families. Multipoint linkage analysis indicated that the most 
likely location for a HSCR locus is between loci D10S208 and D10S196, suggesting 
that a dominant gene for HSCR maps to 10q11.2, a region to which other neural 
crest defects have been mapped."
8402099,"The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 
years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed to evaluate the 
efficacy of wide local excision with split skin grafting. Substantial delay in 
seeking medical attention occurred in 35 patients. At presentation, 20 patients 
had stage I disease, one stage II, 15 stage III and four stage IV. Acral 
lentiginous melanoma (27 patients) was the most common histological type. The 
mean Breslow depth was 6.9 mm and 35 patients had lesions of Clark level IV or 
V. The mean surface area or plantar lesions was 13.3 cm2. Wide local excision 
with split skin grafting was used in 29 patients; four patients with neglected 
advanced plantar lesions had below-knee amputation and seven with metastatic 
disease did not undergo surgery. Graft sepsis occurred in six patients and local 
recurrence in two. Nine patients were alive at follow-up; the 5-year survival 
rate was 25 per cent. Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may 
explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans."
8402643,"Verapamil reverses multidrug resistance acquired by cancer cells during 
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin by inhibiting the 
function of P-glycoprotein. Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the 
cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. We have recently demonstrated that selective 
inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression is among the earliest events in 
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. To explore the influence of verapamil on doxorubicin 
cardiotoxicity, we evaluated [14C]-doxorubicin accumulation, cardiac muscle gene 
expression by Northern blot analysis, and ultrastructural changes in cultured 
cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence of verapamil. Treatment with a 
combination of doxorubicin and verapamil for 24 h did not augment doxorubicin 
accumulation in cardiomyocytes, although substantial augmentation of doxorubicin 
accumulation by verapamil in cardiac fibroblasts was observed. Further, 
treatment with verapamil for 24 h did not augment the decrease in expression of 
muscle genes induced by doxorubicin (myosin light chain 2 slow, troponin I, M 
isoform creatine kinase). However, we found that verapamil reduced alpha-actin 
gene expression in a direct, doxorubicin-independent manner. Furthermore, the 
effect of doxorubicin plus verapamil on alpha-actin gene expression was additive 
over a wide range of doxorubicin and verapamil concentrations, resulting in a 
selective augmentation of doxorubicin-induced inhibition of gene expression for 
this single muscle protein gene. This was reflected in a substantial increase in 
cardiac myocyte damage when treatment with verapamil and doxorubicin was 
compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone by thin section electron 
microscopy. This suggests a possible mechanism by which verapamil may potentiate 
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity."
8405675,"Muscle development involves the coordinated regulation of transcription of 
muscle-type-specific genes and their encoded proteins during myogenesis. We show 
here that transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila tropomyosin I (TmI) gene 
during myogenesis is under the control of at least two muscle enhancer regions 
located within the first intron of the gene. Together these enhancer regions 
contain multiple muscle-type-specific positive and negative cis-acting elements 
which together contribute toward full expression of the gene. One of these 
enhancers is contained within a 355-bp fragment that is sufficient to direct 
high levels of temporally regulated expression from a heterologous promoter in 
all muscles of transgenic flies. Dissection of this enhancer region into smaller 
fragments has allowed us to identify a 91-bp enhancer fragment sufficient for 
directing expression in all somatic and visceral muscles of the larva and adult 
but not in the indirect flight muscles and tergal depressor of the trochanter or 
jump muscles of the adult. We also show that this somatic/visceral muscle 
element(s) can be repressed through an adjacent negative control region, 
suggesting that the regulation of expression in these muscles is under dual 
control during both phases of myogenesis. We propose a model in which 
transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila TmI gene is controlled by the 
cooperative interaction of multiple positive and negative cis-acting regulatory 
elements that control the temporal and muscle-type pattern of expression. The 
distribution of enhancer elements and their control of TmI gene expression are 
similar to those regulating transcription of the muscle promoter of the TmII 
gene and provide a framework for the coordinate expression of the two genes."
8405806,"The elastic properties of many tissues such as the lung, dermis, and large blood 
vessels are due to the presence of elastic fibers in the extracellular space. 
These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be 
composed of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and a 
10-12 nm microfibrillar component, which is located primarily around the 
periphery of the amorphous component. The protein elastin makes up the highly 
insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties. 
Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual 
chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids, 
consonant with its characteristic physical properties. The 72-kDa biosynthetic 
precursor, tropoelastin, is secreted into the extracellular space where it 
becomes highly cross-linked into a rubber-like network through the activity of 
the copper-requiring enzyme lysyl oxidase. Analysis of the elastin gene has 
demonstrated that hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate 
exons and that there is significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple 
isoforms of tropoelastin. The elastin gene promoter contains many potential 
binding sites for various modulating factors indicative of a complex pattern of 
transcriptional regulation. The microfibrils contain several proteins, including 
fibrillin, and probably act as an organizing scaffold in the formation of the 
elastin network. There appears to be a fibrillin gene family in which each 
protein contains multiple repeats of a motif previously found in epidermal 
growth factor and a second motif observed in transforming growth factor beta 
1-binding protein. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 
15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome."
8411173,"Alternating d(GA.TC)n sequences are highly structurally polymorphic. Most of 
their conformational flexibility is likely to reside in the structural 
properties of the individual strands themselves. In this paper the 
conformational behaviour of the d(GA)20 and d(TC)20 oligonucleotides was 
analysed. Formation of d(GA)20 intramolecular duplexes is observed at any pH 
value, from 8.3 to 4.6. On the other hand, intramolecular d(TC)20 duplexes are 
formed only under acidic conditions. The acid d(TC)20 intramolecular duplex is 
likely to be stabilized through the formation of C+C pairs, the thymine residues 
remaining unpaired. The d(GA)20 oligonucleotide also forms intermolecular 
duplexes which coexist with the intramolecular forms at any pH, from 8.3 to 4.6. 
The structural conformation adopted by the d(TC)20 oligonucleotide at neutral pH 
is uncertain. Under these conditions, this oligonucleotide shows an 
electrophoretic apparent molecular weight consistent with the formation of a 
bimolecular complex. However, no hydrogen bonding was observed to occur under 
these conditions. Implications of these results for an understanding of the 
molecular principles behind the conformational flexibility of alternating 
d(GA.TC)n sequences are discussed. The possible biological significance of these 
results is also discussed."
8411203,"Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the 
effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of 
substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under 
various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts 
that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is 
equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the 
mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately 
after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide 
variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also 
the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of 
multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that 
are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field 
of molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution, 
symmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation 
frequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are 
generally deleterious because of their high mutation rates, and teleological 
explanations of DNA base composition."
8411703,"GM2-gangliosidosis is a group of neurological disorders resulting from 
genetically defective catabolism, and consequent abnormal accumulation, of 
GM2-ganglioside. Three major types are distinguished: the B variant (Tay-Sachs 
disease), the O variant (Sandhoff disease), and the AB variant, caused by 
genetic abnormalities in the genes coding for the beta-hexosaminidase alpha- or 
beta-subunit, or the GM2-activator protein, respectively. A number of gene 
abnormalities responsible for Tay-Sachs disease have already been identified and 
the correlation between the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene abnormality and the 
clinical phenotype has been explained in many cases. In the severest phenotype 
of Tay-Sachs disease (infantile form), mRNA of beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit 
is not produced or is unstable such as in French Canadian patients or in Jewish 
patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease, or the polypeptide does not have any 
catalytic activities because of the alteration of glycosylation such as the 
mutation of Glu482-to-Lys found in a Italian patient or the altered structure of 
polypeptide. The mutation identified in a large majority of the Japanese 
infantile Tay-Sachs disease patients, which is a G-to-T substitution at 3'-end 
of intron 5, generates a short mRNA with complete skipping of exon 6 and a 
polypeptide lacking 34 amino acids is generated but catalytically inactive. On 
the other hand, some active alpha beta dimers must be generated in patients with 
milder phenotypes of Tay-Sachs disease such as Gly269-to-Ser mutation in an 
adult form. Some of the mutations appear in high frequency among certain ethnic 
groups such as Ashkenazi Jewish patients and French Canadians.(ABSTRACT

8414992,"In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of a temperature-specific surface 
protein known as SerH3 is primarily controlled by a temperature-dependent change 
in the stability of the mRNA that encodes this protein. At 30 degrees C the 
SerH3 mRNA displays a half-life of 60 minutes while at 40 degrees C the 
half-life decreases to only 3 minutes. We used a Tetrahymena mutant cell line 
(rseB) defective in expression of SerH3 at 30 degrees C to explore the 
mechanisms involved in temperature-dependent mRNA stability. The results of in 
vitro nuclear run-off assays and Northern and slot blot analysis of cytoplasmic 
and nuclear RNAs show that the rseB locus encodes a temperature-sensitive 
product that has no effect on SerH3 gene transcription or the steady-state 
levels of SerH3 nuclear RNA. However, the product of this locus does have a 
dramatic effect on cytoplasmic levels of the SerH3 mRNA at 30 degrees C, 
indicating that SerH3 gene expression is affected post-transcriptionally within 
the cytoplasm. To explore the possibility that the rseB locus controls SerH3 
mRNA stability we developed an in vitro mRNA decay assay. This assay 
successfully duplicates the differential decay of the SerH3 mRNA observed in 
wild-type cells grown at different temperatures. The apparent half-life of the 
SerH3 mRNA in cytoplasmic extracts derived from cells grown at 30 degrees C is 
approximately 45 minutes while in cytoplasmic extracts derived from cells grown 
at 40 degrees C it is only 6 minutes. When similar experiments are performed 
using extracts prepared from the Tetrahymena rseB cell line, we find that the 
SerH3 mRNA is only stable in extract prepared from cells grown under conditions 
in which the mRNA accumulates to detectable levels in the cytoplasm. These 
results indicate that the product of the rseB locus is a trans-acting 
cytoplasmic factor that exerts its effect on SerH3 gene expression by regulating 
SerH3 mRNA stability."
8419235,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the existence of direct neural connections 
between the duodenum and the biliary tract in the Australian possum.
METHODS: Retrogradely transported neuronal dyes, Fast Blue and Dil, were 
injected into the wall of the gallbladder and the sphincter of Oddi. The 
duodenum, biliary tract, and sympathetic and sensory ganglia were examined for 
the presence of labeled cell bodies.
RESULTS: Two to 3 weeks after gallbladder injection, labeled nerve cell bodies 
were found in the myenteric plexus of the proximal duodenum but were rare in the 
duodenum distal to the sphincter of Oddi. No neurons were found in the submucous 
plexus. Labeled nerve cells were also found in the sphincter of Oddi. After 
injection of the sphincter, labeled neurons were in both the submucous and 
myenteric plexuses of the duodenum, on either side. Approximately one third of 
labeled myenteric neurons were immunoreactive for enkephalin. Labeled cell 
bodies were also in the coeliaco-mesenteric, nodose, and dorsal root ganglia 
after both gallbladder and sphincter injection. After a myotomy on the proximal 
duodenum, no neurons were labeled on the pyloric side of the lesion by 
subsequent sphincter injection of dye.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct neural pathways connect the duodenum with the gallbladder 
and the sphincter of Oddi, and the sphincter with the gallbladder; this implies 
that enteric nerve circuits participate in coordinating duodenal and biliary 
functions."
8419325,"Phycobilisomes of the unicellular marine cyanobacteria are unique in having rod 
substructures with two distinct phycoerythrins, PE I and PE II, with five and 
six bilins, respectively (Ong, L. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 
266, 9515-9527). The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of PE I, PE II, and 
phycocyanin, and that for the PE II-associated linker polypeptide, are clustered 
on a single 15-kilobase region of the genome of Synechococcus sp. WH8020. 
Complete sequencing of this region allowed definitive assignment of the 
positions of all bilin attachment sites in these phycobiliproteins. Twelve other 
open reading frames are closely associated with the structural genes specified 
above. Six are homologous to open reading frames adjacent to phycobiliprotein 
genes in other cyanobacteria and inferred to be involved in bilin addition. This 
is the largest number of open reading frames of this class known in any 
cyanobacterium. Another of the open reading frames has a short region of 
striking similarity to the active site sequence of a bovine 
protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase."
8420729,"OBJECTIVES: a) To evaluate the frequency, types, severity, and morbidity of 
iatrogenic complications; b) determine associated factors that favor iatrogenic 
complications; and c) suggest new or more efficient protective measures that may 
be taken to improve patient safety.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational study.
SETTING: Two ICUs in France.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 382 patients (age > or = 15 yrs; 400 
consecutive admissions). Patients were monitored by two physicians in each ICU 
to assess all iatrogenic complications occurring during their ICU stay, with the 
exception of adverse effects of drugs. An iatrogenic complication was defined as 
an adverse event that was independent of the patient's underlying disease.
RESULTS: We observed 316 iatrogenic complications in 124 (31%) of the 400 
admissions. Of these iatrogenic complications, 107 (in 53 [13%] of the 400 
admissions) complications were major, three leading to death. Severe 
hypotension, respiratory distress, pneumothorax, and cardiac arrest represented 
78% of the major iatrogenic complications. Fifty-nine percent of the major 
iatrogenic complications had clearly identified associated factors. Human errors 
accounted for 67% of these factors. Patients > 65 yrs (adjusted odds ratio = 
2.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 4.9) and those patients admitted with two 
or more organ failures (adjusted odds ratio = 4.8, 95% confidence interval: 2.5 
to 9.2) were more likely to develop major iatrogenic complications. High or 
excessive nursing workload also led to an increased risk of major iatrogenic 
complications. Persistent morbidity, secondary to iatrogenic complications at 
the time of discharge, was present in five survivors. The risk of ICU death was 
about two-fold higher for the patients with major iatrogenic complications than 
in the remaining patients after adjusting for the Organ System Failure Score and 
the prognosis of the disease (relative risk = 1.92, 95% confidence interval: 
1.28 to 2.56).
CONCLUSIONS: Major iatrogenic complications were frequent, associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality rates, related to high or excessive nursing 
workload, and were often secondary to human errors. To improve patient safety in 
our ICUs, preventive measures should be targeted primarily on the elderly and 
the most severely ill patients. Special attention should be given to improving 
the organization of workload and training, and promoting wider use of 
noninvasive monitoring."
8421095,"Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), a syndrome of inherited tissue 
hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone, is linked to thyroid hormone receptor (TR) 
mutations. A typical feature of GRTH is variable severity of organ involvement 
among families that, surprisingly, does not correlate with the degree of 
T3-binding impairment of the corresponding in vitro synthesized mutant TRs. 
Furthermore, variations in the clinical severity among family members harboring 
identical TR beta mutations have been reported. We compared serum levels of 
thyroid hormones that maintained a normal TSH in members of a large family with 
GRTH divided in three groups: Group A, 8 affected subjects with a mutation 
replacing arginine-320 with a histidine in the T3-binding domain of TR beta; 
Group B, 11 first degree relatives (sibs and children of affected subjects) with 
no TR beta mutation; Group C, 16 controls related by marriage. TSH values were 
not different among the three groups. As expected, total and free T4 and T3, and 
rT3 levels were significantly higher in Group A vs Groups B and C. However, with 
the exception of T3, the same tests were also significantly higher in Group B vs 
Group C. The latter differences are not due to thyroid hormone transport in 
serum since TBG concentrations were not different. It is postulated that genetic 
variability of factors that contribute to the action of thyroid hormone modulate 
the phenotype of GRTH associated with TR beta mutations."
8426722,"Oral features of Crohn's disease include ulcers, lip fissuring, cobblestone 
plaques, angular cheilitis, polypoid lesions, and perioral erythema. 
Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare eruption of the oral mucosa characterized by 
tiny yellow pustules. It is considered a marker for inflammatory bowel disease. 
We describe a 45-year-old woman with a 6-month history of painful sores in her 
mouth, diarrhea, weight loss, and cutaneous lesions. Oral examination revealed 
cobblestone plaques and indentation on the tongue and friable vegetating 
pustules on the labial commissures. Staphylococcus simulans was isolated from 
the pustules. Laboratory studies revealed leucocytosis, eosinophilia, and low 
hemoglobin and zinc levels. Histologic study of the labial lesions revealed 
hyperplastic epithelium with intraepithelial clefts that contain eosinophils and 
neutrophils. Tongue lesions showed chronic inflammation with noncaseating 
granulomas. Later, colonoscopy and biopsy demonstrated Crohn's disease of the 
anorectal region. Pyostomatitis vegetans lesions regressed after oral zinc 
supplementation. Prednisone treatment resulted in healing of the tongue lesions. 
In our patient, pyostomatitis vegetans appeared to be related to zinc deficiency 
that may have been caused by malabsorption. The pathogenetic interrelationship 
between pyostomatitis vegetans and Crohn's disease is discussed."

8432776,"Low dose infusion of alpha human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown 
to cause a shift of intravascular fluid to the interstitial space. No studies 
have been reported on the effect of ANP on capillary permeability to plasma

volume of saline control when infused over 90 min, on plasma volume, 
transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin, and the rate of reentry of 
albumin to the vascular space in eight normal subjects. Intravenous injection of 
125I-human serum albumin was used for measurement of plasma volume and 
intravascular albumin escape rate. A significant ANP-induced fall in plasma 
volume (P < 0.01) was observed. Transcapillary escape rate of intravascular 
albumin when corrected for concurrent plasma volume changes showed a 
significantly greater escape during ANP infusion than during saline control (P < 
0.05). The mean +/- SEM changes in plasma albumin concentration were +0.36 +/- 
0.22 g/L.h during ANP infusion and -0.46 +/- 0.50 g/L.h during placebo. Plasma 
sodium, red cell volume, and urinary albumin and radioactivity remained 
unchanged. The mass of albumin reentering the circulation per hour showed no 
significant difference between the 2 days. In summary, low dose ANP infusion in 
healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the 
circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon."

eukaryotic cell. This result, when taken together with previous reports, raised 
the possibility that genomic DNA of prokaryotes residing in an eukaryotic cell

8434615,"Steven Pfeiffer syndrome pedigrees (three 3 generation and four 2 generation) 
have been recorded to date in addition to at least a dozen sporadic cases. 
Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance is characteristic of the 
7 familial instances. Variable expressivity has involved mostly the presence or 
absence of syndactyly and the degree of syndactyly when present. Classic 
Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with 
Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do 
poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. 
Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is 
severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients 
also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred 
sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate 
entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is 
commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be 
found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe 
neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence. 
Recognition of type 3 is particularly important because extreme ocular proptosis 
in the absence of cloverleaf skull but with various visceral anomalies can 
result in failure to diagnose Pfeiffer syndrome and labeling the patient as an

8435921,"The appearance of photoaged skin is cosmetically unacceptable to many in our 
society. Ostensibly, avoidance of ultraviolet light and sunlight from early

photoaging. Improvement with tretinoin therapy has been quantified clinically 
and histologically. A major degree of improvement occurs in 6 to 12 months, and 
maintenance treatment one to three times per week may continue this response. 
Tretinoin therapy should optimally be used with daily moisturizer and sunscreen

8437381,"A 65-year-old man was admitted with a sudden onset of dyspnea. Severe mitral 
regurgitation due to torn chordae tendinae was revealed on UCG. Mitral valve 
replacement was undergone. The postoperative course was complicated with a low 
cardiac output syndrome which was successfully treated with IABP, catecholamines 
and vasodilators. However, stupor developed on the 4 th postoperative day, 
following by tetrapregia on the 8 th day, and deep coma on the 15 th day 
respectively. Laboratory studies of the 4 th day disclosed the following values, 
serum sodium 150 mEq/l, blood urea nitrogen 84.7 mg/dl, blood sugar 184 mg/dl 
and calculated serum osmolality 354 mOsm/l. Cranial CT of the 15 th day showed 
an obscure low density area in the central pons which was strongly suggestive of 
central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). His CNS symptoms improved dramatically after 
administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T). A diagnosis of 
CPM was made on MRI of the 41 st day. He discharged without any neurological 
deficit on the 62 nd day."
8437594,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation for type IV glycogen storage disease 
(branching-enzyme deficiency) results in the resorption of extrahepatic deposits 
of amylopectin, but the mechanism of resorption is not known.
METHODS: We studied two patients with type IV glycogen storage disease 37 and 91 
months after liver transplantation and a third patient with lysosomal 
glucocerebrosidase deficiency (type 1 Gaucher's disease), in whom tissue 
glucocerebroside deposition had decreased 26 months after liver replacement, to 
determine whether the migration of cells from the allograft (microchimerism) 
could explain the improved metabolism of enzyme-deficient tissues in the 
recipient. Samples of blood and biopsy specimens of the skin, lymph nodes, 
heart, bone marrow, or intestine were examined immunocytochemically with the use 
of donor-specific monoclonal anti-HLA antibodies and the polymerase chain 
reaction, with preliminary amplification specific to donor alleles of the gene 
for the beta chain of HLA-DR molecules, followed by hybridization with 
allele-specific oligonucleotide probes.
RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed that the cardiac deposits of 
amylopectin in the patients with glycogen storage disease and the lymph-node 
deposits of glucocerebroside in the patient with Gaucher's disease were 
dramatically reduced after transplantation. Immunocytochemical analysis showed 
cells containing the HLA phenotypes of the donor in the heart and skin of the 
patients with glycogen storage disease and in the lymph nodes, but not the skin, 
of the patient with Gaucher's disease. Polymerase-chain-reaction analysis 
demonstrated donor HLA-DR DNA in the heart of both patients with glycogen 
storage disease, in the skin of one of them, and in the skin, intestine, blood, 
and bone marrow of the patient with Gaucher's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic microchimerism occurs after liver allotransplantation and 
can ameliorate pancellular enzyme deficiencies."

sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are 
administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an 
intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Judicious use of flumazenil may provide 
useful diagnostic information and may obviate the need for mechanical

exists regarding the possible precipitation of seizure activity in the setting 
of mixed tricyclic antidepressant-benzodiazepine overdose, worldwide experience 
with flumazenil has validated its safety and efficacy."
8440247,"Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two 
specificity factors and their recognition sequences. These are cleavage and 
polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), recognizing the polyadenylation 
signal AAUAAA, and poly(A) binding protein II (PAB II), interacting with the 
growing poly(A) tail. Their effects are independent of ATP and an RNA 5'-cap. 
Analysis of RNA-protein interactions by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis shows 
that CPSF, PAB II and poly(A) polymerase form a quaternary complex with the 
substrate RNA that transiently stabilizes the binding of poly(A) polymerase to 
the RNA 3'-end. Only the complex formed from all three proteins is competent for 
the processive synthesis of a full-length poly(A) tail."
8440944,"In an effort to understand the molecular genetic basis of temporal variation in 
frequency and severity of bacterial disease, genetic relationships among strains 
of Streptococcus pyogenes that caused scarlet fever epidemics in Canada in the 
early 1940s and in eastern Germany in the 1960s to 1980s were studied. 
Application of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and comparative sequencing of 
the gene (speA) encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever 
toxin) revealed that new waves of scarlet fever are associated with an increase 
in frequency of S. pyogenes clones carrying variant speA alleles. This finding 
suggests that the occurrence of new scarlet fever epidemics can be predicted by 
comprehensive monitoring of the frequency of S. pyogenes clones with variant 
toxin alleles."
8441637,"All DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases contain a single conserved cysteine. It 
has been proposed that this cysteine initiates catalysis by attacking the C6 of 
cytosine and thereby activating the normally inert C5 position. We show here 
that substitutions of this cysteine in the E. coli methylase M. EcoRII with 
either serine or tryptophan results in a complete loss of ability to transfer 
methyl groups to DNA. Interestingly, mutants with either serine or glycine 
substitution bind tightly to substrate DNA. These mutants resemble the wild-type 
enzyme in that their binding to substrate is not eliminated by the presence of 
non-specific DNA in the reaction, it is sensitive to methylation status of the 
substrate and is stimulated by an analog of the methyl donor. Hence the 
conserved cysteine is not essential for the specific stable binding of the 
enzyme to its substrate. However, substitution of the cysteine with the bulkier 
tryptophan does reduce DNA binding. We also report here a novel procedure for 
the synthesis of DNA containing 5-fluorocytosine. Further, we show that a DNA 
substrate for M. EcoRII in which the target cytosine is replaced by 
5-fluorocytosine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme and that it forms 
an irreversible complex with the enzyme. As expected, this modified substrate 
does not form irreversible complexes with the mutants."
8441638,"The product of the dcm gene is the only DNA cytosine-C5 methyltransferase of 
Escherichia coli K-12; it catalyses transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl 
methionine (SAM) to the C-5 position of the inner cytosine residue of the 
cognate sequence CCA/TGG. Sequence-specific, covalent crosslinking of the enzyme 
to synthetic oligonucleotides containing 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine is 
demonstrated. This reaction is abolished if serine replaces the cysteine at 
residue #177 of the enzyme. These results lend strong support to a catalytic 
mechanism in which an enzyme sulfhydryl group undergoes Michael addition to the 
C5-C6 double bond, thus activating position C-5 of the substrate DNA cytosine 
residue for electrophilic attack by the methyl donor SAM. The enzyme is capable 
of self-methylation in a DNA-independent reaction requiring SAM and the presence 
of cysteine at position #177."
8444882,"In the brain, thyroid hormone dynamically regulates levels of the short-lived 
plasma membrane protein, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. In cultured 
astrocytes, thyroxine modulates deiodinase levels by activating 
cytoskeletal-plasma membrane interactions that increase the rate of inactivation 
of the enzyme. Here we characterized the effects of these thyroxine-dependent 
cytoskeletal interactions upon the route of internalization of the deiodinase by 
following the intracellular transit of the affinity-labeled substrate-binding 
subunit of the deiodinase (p29). Thyroxine rapidly induced the inactivation of 
the deiodinase and initiated the binding of p29 to F-actin. By 40 min, > 75% of 
the p29 had been transported to an endosomal pool, which was followed by 
dissociation of the F-actin-p29 complex. There was no significant accumulation 
of p29 in the dense lysosomes seen in the presence of thyroxine. In the absence 
of thyroxine, p29 was internalized and transported to the dense lysosomes at a 
rate parallel to the inactivation rate of the deiodinase (t1/2 0.75 and 0.64 h, 
respectively) without involvement with the microfilaments. These data 
demonstrate that thyroxine targets type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase to an 
endosomal pool by activating specific protein-F-actin interactions involved in 
microfilament-mediated intracellular protein trafficking."
8445063,"BACKGROUND: Topical PUVA therapy has become a useful alternative for patients 
who cannot tolerate the systemic side effects of nausea and headache or are 
concerned about the ophthalmologic risk associated with oral PUVA therapy. 
However, there is no study to date on the systemic absorption of psoralen after 
the localized application of topical paint PUVA.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the plasma level of 
8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) after paint PUVA therapy for patients with 
palmoplantar psoriasis or eczema.
METHODS: Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to determine 
8-MOP plasma levels in eight patients with palmoplantar psoriasis and two with 
eczema. Three patients receiving oral PUVA therapy served as the control group.
RESULTS: Plasma levels of 8-MOP taken 1, 6, and 24 hours after topical PUVA 
treatments of patients with palmoplantar psoriasis were undetectable. One 
patient with hand eczema consistently had detectable 8-MOP levels 1 hour after 
topical PUVA treatments.
CONCLUSION: This report indicates that there is minimal, if any, systemic 
absorption of 8-MOP after topical PUVA treatment of patients with palmoplantar 
psoriasis."
8445613,"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is characterised by (1) early 
contractures of the Achilles tendons, elbows, and postcervical muscles, (2) 
slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a predominantly 
humeroperoneal distribution in the early stages, and (3) cardiomyopathy with 
conduction defects and risk of sudden death. Inheritance is usually X linked 
recessive but can be autosomal dominant. Family linkage studies have mapped X 
linked EMD to the distal long arm of the X chromosome but precise genetic 
localisation has been hampered by the rarity of this condition. We report three 
new families with X linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy studied with DNA 
markers from Xq27-qter and three previously published families typed for 
additional markers. No recombination was observed with the red/green cone 
pigment locus, RGCP (lod score, Z = 2.46), the factor VIII coagulant gene locus, 
F8C (Z = 6.39), or with DXS115 (Z = 4.94). Two recombinants were observed which 
mapped EMD distal to DXS15 (DX13) and DXS52 (St14) respectively. Multipoint 
linkage analysis gave odds exceeding 200:1 for EMD being distal to these 
markers. A multipoint analysis incorporating published data gave the map 
cen-DXS304-9cM-DXS15-3cM-DXS52-2 cM-(RGCP,EMD)-3cM-F8C-2cM-DXS115 with odds of 
120:1 in favour of a location for EMD between DXS52 and F8C as compared to the 
next best position distal to F8C."
8449832,"Pulse field gel electrophoresis using a contour-clamped homogeneous electric 
field was applied for the analysis of DNA-fragmenting activity of antitumor 
agents towards human uterine cervix carcinoma HeLa S3 cells. Duocarmycins 
(DUMs), novel antitumor antibiotics with ultrapotent cell growth-inhibitory 
activities, caused DNA fragmentation at 10 times their IC50 values at 2 h 
exposure. At 100 times their IC50 values, the size of the smallest fragments was 
about 245 kilobase pairs (kbp). DUMA, DUMB1 and DUMB2 exhibited similar DNA 
fragmentation patterns, suggesting similar action mechanisms. DNA fragmentation 
was also detected in cells treated with radical producers, intercalators and 
topoisomerase inhibitors. Two bands of about 1800 and 1500 kbp were commonly 
detected in the cells treated with DUMs and these agents. In addition, fragments 
of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase 
inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the 
broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical 
producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin. DUMs showed a characteristic DNA 
fragmentation pattern, since both types of fragments induced by the 
topoisomerase inhibitor and the radical producers were simultaneously detected, 
suggesting a novel mode of interaction with DNA. DNA-crosslinking agents and 
mitotic inhibitors did not induce DNA fragmentation under these conditions. The 
pulse field gel electrophoresis is potentially useful for characterizing 
DNA-cleaving activity of various antitumor agents at the cellular level."
8449897,"The intergenic region between the mouse alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain and 
beta-myosin heavy chain genes has previously been shown to direct expression of 
the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transgenic mice 
in a tissue-specific manner. Sequence analyses located a putative 
myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) site situated in the regulatory 
region of this gene proximal to the start site of transcription. The role of 
this element in directing the cardiac compartment-specific expression of the 
transgene was assessed. The polymerase chain reaction was used to perform 
substitution mutagenesis of the MEF-2 binding site, and lack of MEF-2 binding 
was confirmed by gel retardation assays. The resultant construct was used to 
generate transgenic mice. Surprisingly, transgene expression was not 
down-regulated, but was significantly increased in the hearts of the MEF-2 
mutant mice. In addition, cardiac-specific expression of the transgene was 
perturbed with significant levels of ectopic expression occurring in the aorta."

induction to military service. The stratified Kaplan-Meier product limit method

mean LE adjusted for occupational group, marital status, and the age at entry to 
the cohort (and its 95% confidence limits) was in endurance sports (long

the reference group 69.9 (69.0, 70.9) yr. The increased mean life expectancies 
were mainly explained by decreased cardiovascular mortality (endurance sports 
mortality odds ratio OR = 0.49 (95% CL 0.26, 0.93), team sports OR = 0.61 (0.41, 
0.92) compared with referents). For maximum life span no differences between the

8456806,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is characterized by bone fragility without 
significant deformity, osteopenia, normal stature, blue sclerae, and autosomal 
dominant inheritance. Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce 
about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I 
phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent 
expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I 
collagen. Short-pulse labeling of dermal fibroblasts with [3H]proline from 
affected individuals in 19 families indicates that most have alterations in the 
expected 2:1 synthetic ratio of pro alpha 1(I): pro alpha 2(I), with most having 
decreased production of pro alpha 1(I). Ratios of COL1A1:COL1A2 mRNA from these 
individuals, using slot-blot hybridization, indicate that they fall into 
different groups, but that most have decreased COL1A1 mRNA levels, compared with 
controls. These data suggest that most of our OI I families have COL1A1 
mutations. Copy number and size of the COL1A1 gene by restriction endonuclease 
analysis of genomic DNA from affected individuals are normal in the families 
examined. We have identified one 3 generation family in which all affected 
members have one normal COL1A1 allele and another with a 5 base-pair deletion 
near the 3' end of the gene. The deletion creates a shift in the translational 
reading-frame and predicts the synthesis of an elongated pro alpha 1(I) chain. 
In a second family, a father and a son have a single exon deletion that results 
from a splicing mutation. Chemical cleavage analysis of amplified cDNA from 
affected individuals in different regions of the COL1A1 gene, including the 
promoter, suggests that several individuals have point mutations within the 
coding region of the gene, while one individual may have a small deletion within 
the alpha 1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptide region. Our data provide evidence 
for significant molecular heterogeneity within the OI type I phenotype and 
indicate that a variety of mutations can result in decreased synthesis of type I 
collagen."
8456822,"Characteristic temporal bone changes have recently been defined by high 
resolution CT in nine patients with achondroplasia (Cobb et al., Am J 
Neuroradiol 9:1195, 1988). These included narrowing of the skull base and 
""towering"" petrous ridges resulting in abnormal orientation of the inner and 
middle ear structures. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes 
are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and 
ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. All had a history 
of frequent otitis media and four had experienced tympanic membrane tube 
insertion. Three patients had significant sensorineural hearing loss, two had 
conductive hearing loss and one patient had combined hearing loss. None of the 
temporal bone morphologic changes were found to be correlated with the degree of 
either sensorineural or conductive hearing loss. Fusion of the ossicular chain 
was not present in any of our cases. Appropriate treatment of frequent acute 
otitis media and early awareness of middle ear effusions and conductive hearing 
loss in children with achondroplasia may be of great importance in preventing 
permanent hearing loss."
8457417,"We surgically treated 16 patients with Bertolotti's syndrome (chronic, 
persistent low back pain and radiographically diagnosed transitional lumbar 
vertebra). Eight had posterolateral fusion and another eight resection of the 
transitional articulation. Thirteen patients had in addition to the chronic low 
back pain, suffered from repeated episodes or chronic sciatica. In six cases 
with resection treatment, local injections were administered at the transitional 
articulation before deciding for resection of the transitional joint; each 
patient reported transient relief of pain, while this preoperative test did not 
correlate with successful outcome of treatment. Six patients had to be treated 
with second operations. Ten of the 16 operatively treated patients showed 
improvement of the low back pain, and this result was similar in the group 
treated with fusion and in that treated with resection. Seven had no low back 
pain at follow-up, and the improvement according to the Oswestry pain scale was 
similar in the two groups, and statistically significant. Eleven patients still 
had persisting episodes of sciatica (versus 13 preoperatively). The average 
disability according to the Oswestry total disability scale was 30%, 
corresponding with moderate outcome, and both operatively treated groups did 
equally well. At follow-up the first disc above the fused segments was found to

cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8458255,"We isolated mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lose a 100 kb linear yeast 
artificial chromosome (YAC) at elevated rates. Mutations in two of these LCS 
(linear chromosome stability) genes had little or no effect on the loss rate of 
a circular YAC that had the same centromere and origin of replication as present 
on the linear YAC. Moreover, mutations in these LCS genes also increased the 
loss rate of an authentic linear yeast chromosome, chromosome III, but had only 
small effects on the loss rate of a circular derivative of chromosome III. As 
these mutants preferentially destabilize linear chromosomes, they may affect 
chromosome stability through interactions at telomeres. Telomeres are thought to 
be essential for the protection and complete replication of chromosome ends. The 
cytological properties of telomeres suggest that these structures may play 
additional roles in chromosome function. The lengths of the terminal C1-3A 
repeats at the ends of yeast chromosomes were unaltered in the linear 
preferential lcs mutants, suggesting that these mutants do not affect the 
replication or protection of telomeric DNA. Thus, the linear-preferential lcs 
mutants may identify a role for telomeres in chromosome stability that is 
distinct from their function in the replication and protection of chromosomal 
termini."
8459803,"The glycosylation of proteins in fibroblasts from people with the premature 
ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria) was investigated. 
Protein was prepared from fibroblast cell lines established from skin biopsy 
taken from progeria patients and control donors. Glycoproteins were labelled by 
the covalent attachment of the steroid hapten digoxygenin to the sugar group. 
After separation of total protein by SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto 
Immobilon-PTM, glycoproteins were detected by enzyme immunoassay. We have 
observed a glycoprotein of M(r) 200 kDa which is consistently present in protein 
preparations from progeria fibroblasts and which is absent, or markedly reduced, 
in preparations from control fibroblasts. This suggests that it may be useful as 
a marker for progeria. Similar analysis of progeria lymphoblast and control 
lymphoblast cultures did not show this altered pattern of glycosylated proteins, 
indicating that it may be cell-type specific. Glycoproteins were also detected 
by labelling fibroblasts in vitro with D-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride 
followed by SDS-PAGE of isolated protein and subsequent fluorography. Profiles 
of glycoproteins from progeria and control fibroblasts were consistent with 
those obtained from labelling of carbohydrate groups with digoxygenin. Protease 
digestion of cell protein verified that the band at M(r) 200 kDa contains a 
protein core. Characteristic features of progeria primarily involve the 
connective tissue and include wrinkled and loose skin, loss of soft tissue, thin 
limbs and stiff joints. Death of progeria patients is usually a result of 
cardiovascular abnormalities. The most consistent manifestations thus involve 
the connective tissue. The glycoprotein of M(r) 200 kDa which we have observed 
in progeria fibroblasts in vitro could reflect a perturbation in glycosylation 
which may underly the connective tissue defects seen in progeria."
8460153,"Two overlapping cDNAs that encode a 197-kDa sequence-selective DNA-binding 
protein were isolated from libraries derived from mouse lymphoid cell mRNA. In 
addition to a DNA-binding domain, the protein contains both a chromodomain, 
which occurs in proteins that are implicated in chromatin compaction, and an 
SNF2/SWI2-like helicase domain, which occurs in proteins that are believed to 
activate transcription by counteracting the repressive effects of chromatin 
structure. A Southern blot analysis indicated that this protein, which we have 
named CHD-1, for chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein, is present in most, 
if not all, mammalian species. A Northern blot analysis revealed multiple CHD 
mRNA components that differed both qualitatively and quantitatively among 
various cell types. The various mRNAs, which are probably produced by 
alternative RNA processing, could conceivably encode tissue-specific and 
developmental stage-specific isoforms of the protein. Based on its interesting 
combination of features, we suspect that CHD-1 plays an important role in gene 
regulation."
8460633,"We have previously described a series of patients in whom the deletion of 1-2 
megabases (Mb) of DNA from the tip of the short arm of chromosome 16 (band 
16p13.3) is associated with alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome 
(ATR-16). We now show that one of these patients has a de novo truncation of the 
terminal 2 Mb of chromosome 16p and that telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)n has been 
added at the site of breakage. This suggests that the chromosomal break, which 
is paternal in origin and which probably arose at meiosis, has been stabilized 
in vivo by the direct addition of the telomeric sequence. Sequence comparisons 
of this breakpoint with that of a previously described chromosomal truncation 
(alpha alpha)TI do not reveal extensive sequence homology. However, both 
breakpoints show minimal complementarity (3-4 bp) to the proposed RNA template 
of human telomerase at the site at which telomere repeats have been added. 
Unlike previously characterized individuals with ATR-16, the clinical features 
of this patient appear to be solely due to monosomy for the terminal portion of 
16p13.3. The identification of further patients with ""pure"" monosomy for the tip 
of chromosome 16p will be important for defining the loci contributing to the 
phenotype of this syndrome."
8463526,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of clinically derived prognostic scores in 
targeting stroke rehabilitation in elderly patients.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: One-year prospective cohort study in 96 
hospitalized stroke patients over 75 years of age from a well defined 
geographical area.
MEASUREMENTS: Edinburgh prognostic score (incorporating measures of motor 
deficit, proprioception, and power), Orpington prognostic score (Edinburgh score 
modified to include a measure of cognition), and Barthel ADL scores were 
measured at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after stroke. These scores were correlated with 
outcome and patients' Barthel ADL score at discharge or at 16 weeks if still in 
hospital.
RESULTS: Edinburgh prognostic score measured at 2 weeks correlated significantly 
with Barthel ADL score at discharge or at 16 weeks (r2 = 0.57, P < 0.001), and 
Orpington prognostic scores showed greater correlation (r2 = 0.89 vs 0.57), 
especially in patients with dementia (r2 = 0.81 vs 0.39). Barthel ADL scores at 
2 weeks showed a weak correlation with Barthel ADL scores at discharge or 16 
weeks (r2 = 0.58). Patients with Orpington Score < 3.2 were discharged within 3 
weeks of stroke, whereas those scoring > 5.2 required long-term care. Most 
patients (90%) with Orpington Score of 3-5 were eventually discharged home 
although this was not always apparent on initial clinical assessment at the time 
of admission.
CONCLUSIONS: The Orpington score when assessed at 2-weeks post-stroke is a 
useful prognostic indicator with special suitability for the elderly and may 
help to select patients most likely to benefit from stroke unit rehabilitation."
8464926,"Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the enzyme responsible for synthesis of the 
neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid in neurons and pancreatic beta cells. 
It is represented by two isoforms, GAD-65 and GAD-67, which are the products of 
two different genes and differ substantially only at their N-terminal regions. 
GAD-65 is a dominant autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus. In neurons and beta cells, GAD is concentrated around 
synaptic vesicles and synaptic-like microvesicles, respectively, as well as in 
the area of the Golgi complex. The mechanisms responsible for specific targeting 
of GAD to these organelles are not yet understood. The elucidation of the 
mechanism of subcellular targeting of GAD may be relevant to understanding its 
role as an autoantigen. In this study, the cloned genes for GAD-65 and GAD-67 
were expressed separately in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and COS cells. 
While GAD-67 had a diffuse cytoplasmic localization, GAD-65 had a punctate 
distribution, with most of the immunoreactivity being concentrated in the area 
of the Golgi complex. A chimeric protein in which the 88 N-terminal amino acids 
of GAD-67 were replaced by the 83 N-terminal amino acids of GAD-65 was targeted 
to the Golgi complex, indicating that the N-terminal region of GAD-65 contains a 
targeting signal sufficient for directing the remaining portion of the molecule, 
highly similar in GAD-65 and GAD-67, to the Golgi complex-associated structures."
8466736,"To assess left ventricular (LV) structural and functional changes, 45 
hypertensive patients were studied by echocardiography after 2 weeks of placebo 
and 6 months of isradipine monotherapy. Although LV cavity size did not change, 
LV wall thickness decreased dramatically (P < .0001), producing a significant 
decrease in LV mass index (from 158 g/m2 to 136 g/m2; P < .0001). In addition, 
LV fractional shortening (FS) did not change (1.2%; P = NS) whereas the cardiac 
index increased (6.4%; P = .0007) due to a modest tachycardia accompanied by a 
reduction in total peripheral resistance (-22.1%; P < .0001). The magnitude of 
the reduction of LV mass was related to the degree of FS increase (r = -0.70; P 
< .0001), an indication of beneficial LV remodeling. It can be concluded that 
isradipine antihypertensive therapy leads to regression of LV hypertrophy 
without depression of LV pump function."
8468724,"BACKGROUND: B-cell prolymphocytic leukemias or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias 
are aggressive variants of chronic lymphoid leukemias. The small studies 
conducted to date have shown median survival durations of approximately 3 years 
for patients who have B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and 7.5 months for those 
who have T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, compared with about 8 years for 
patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 
chemotherapy consisting of alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and 
chlorambucil combined with prednisone has achieved overall response rates of 50% 
to 70%, but this regimen has resulted in response rates of less than 25% in 
prolymphocytic leukemia. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine 
analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.
PURPOSE: This prospective phase II trial by the Leukemia Cooperative Group of 
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer was performed to 
assess the activity and toxicity of DCF in prolymphocytic leukemia.
METHODS: Twenty patients with B-cell or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia were 
given DCF at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 3 weeks, then 
every other week for three doses. Patients who had at least partial response 
received maintenance therapy once a month for a maximum of 6 months. Fourteen 
patients had B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and six had T-cell prolymphocytic 
leukemia, as evidenced by morphologic and immunologic criteria; three were 
previously untreated, eight had been given one or two chemotherapeutic regimens, 
and nine had been given more than two.
RESULTS: One patient died of an unknown cause during the first 6 weeks of 
treatment, and one died of disseminated toxoplasmosis during the period of 
maintenance therapy, 5 months after achieving partial remission. Nine (45% 
response rate) of the 20 patients achieved partial remission, including seven 
(50%) of 14 with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and two (33%) of six with T-cell 
prolymphocytic leukemia. The median duration of response was 9 months (range, 
2-30 months); for patients with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, the median 
remission duration was 12 months. No complete remission was observed. Toxic 
effects included nausea and vomiting (30%), infections (30%), and transient 
increase in liver enzymes (35%) and in creatinine (20%) levels. Eight patients 
experienced thrombocytopenia, the major hematologic toxic effect; four had grade 
3 or 4 toxic effects.
CONCLUSION: DCF is active in prolymphocytic leukemia, even as salvage therapy in 
patients who had received multiple prior chemotherapeutic regimens.
IMPLICATIONS: Trials using DCF or other purine analogues alone or in combination 
with standard chemotherapeutic agents in front-line or salvage therapy are 
warranted to improve the prognosis of patients with prolymphocytic leukemia."
8469500,"BACKGROUND: Erythrasma is an uncommon vulvar infection, best diagnosed by its 
fluorescence under the Wood lamp. This report shows that despite a negative Wood 
lamp examination, the diagnosis can be made histologically.
CASE: A 42-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a persistent candidal 
infection. Evaluation included a Wood lamp examination, wet mount, and potassium 
hydroxide test of the affected skin, all of which were negative. A biopsy of the 
area demonstrated rods and filamentous organisms in the keratotic layer 
consistent with a Corynebacterium minutissimum infection. The patient was 
diagnosed as having erythrasma, and she responded to oral erythromycin.
CONCLUSION: Persistent vulvar diseases may be caused by erythrasma despite a 
negative Wood lamp examination. The diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the 
lesion."
8469539,"The relationship between burning mouth syndrome and 48 variables was 
investigated in 241 patients, 45 years old and older, who had attended the Oral 
Medicine Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Stellenbosch during a 
period of 4 years. A total of 85 cases of burning mouth syndrome were diagnosed 
in 65 women and 20 men. Statistically significant relationships (p < 0.05) were 
found with self-medication, xerostomia, and other salivary disturbances in both 
men and women with burning mouth syndrome when compared with their respective 
controls. Among the women with BMS, significant relationships were also found 
with anemia, inadequate diet, chronic infection, hormone therapy, 
ulcerative/erosive lesions, and atrophy. In contrast men with BMS showed 
statistically significant relationships between taking prescribed medication, 
central nervous system disturbances, gingivitis, and denture-related problems. 
In addition, significant associations were related to variables such as 
psychogenic factors, regurgitation, flatulence, and periodontitis."
8470439,"The association between aortic stenosis and digestive angiodysplasia has been 
described for the first time by Heyde in 1958. This entity is thus known as 
Heyde's syndrome. In many instances, the recurrent small intestinal bleeding 
originating from angiodysplasia stopped after aortic valve replacement. We 
report two cases of patients presenting with a recurrent small intestinal 
bleeding originating from digestive angiodysplasia and suffering from aortic 
stenosis. Diagnosis of both pathologies is well documented in both cases. The 
replacement of the aortic valve by a biologic prosthesis stopped the bleeding. 
Prior to aortic valve replacement, the two patients suffered severe recurrent 
blood loss from intestinal angiodysplasia. The treatment of aortic stenosis 
greatly favored both cardiac and general status. We recommend aortic valve 
replacement with a biologic prosthesis prior to intestinal resection in patients 
presenting with Heyde's syndrome. We stress on the fact that anticoagulants must 
be stopped in order to minimize the risk of further bleeding."
8470663,"Data from a large, population-based, case-control study were analyzed to assess 
the role of parental smoking in childhood brain tumors. Parents of 361 cases, 
newly diagnosed between January 1, 1977 and December 31, 1981 and ascertained 
from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program 
registries, and 1,083 controls had been interviewed. No significant differences 
in risks were found to be associated with maternal or paternal smoking at any 
time (odds ratio (OR) = 0.92 for mothers and 1.06 for fathers), during the year 
of birth of the child (which included both the prenatal and postnatal periods) 
(ORs = 0.84 for < 1 pack/day and 1.0 for > or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.68 
for < 1 pack/day and 1.07 for > or = 1 pack/day for fathers), or 2 years before 
the child was born, i.e., the pre-conception period (ORs = 0.75 for < 1 pack/day 
and 1.01 for > or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.90 for < 1 pack/day and 1.15 
for > or = 1 pack/day for fathers). Mothers were also specifically asked if they 
smoked during the pregnancy, and no association was found compared with never 
smokers (OR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.45) or for ever-smokers 
who continued to smoke during pregnancy compared with those who stopped smoking 
during pregnancy (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.75-1.78). Finally, no significant increase 
in risk of brain tumors was found for the child's passive exposure to parental 
smoking during the period from birth to diagnosis of the brain tumor in the 
case. The lack of an effect of parental smoking was observed for both the major 
histologic types and locations of brain tumors. These findings and those from 
earlier studies provide no support for the hypothesis that parental cigarette 
smoking influences the risk of brain tumors in children."
8471783,"Progeria is a rare syndrome, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 250,000 
births. Although children with progeria have the appearance of premature aging 
or senility, the term is misleading because reported cases of progeria have not 
manifested most physical or biochemical aspects of old age. Many children with 
progeria appear normal at birth and then progressively, and rather rapidly, 
develop the characteristic features during early childhood. Although first 
described in the 1880s, only approximately 100 cases of progeria are reported in 
the international literature. The single case study of hearing in progeria, 
which appeared in 1965, is limited to pure-tone and speech audiometry findings. 
We report the results of otolaryngologic examination and pure-tone, speech, 
immittance, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry for a 5-year-old 
female with progeria. The patient had a mild-to-moderate, bilateral, conductive 
hearing loss. Immittance measurements were consistent with fixation of the 
ossicular chain and this was confirmed surgically. Mildly prolonged ABR wave I-V 
latencies suggest possible auditory central nervous system involvement."
8472392,"One in three Americans will eventually die of cardiovascular disease. 
Antioxidant vitamins, which are postulated to reduce risk by about 20-30%, could 
have substantial clinical and public health impact. Basic research, clinical 
observation, and epidemiology have contributed to an emerging body of evidence 
on the atherogenicity of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, which could be an 
important mechanism to explain why antioxidant vitamins may decrease risk of 
coronary disease. The antioxidant-vitamin/cardiovascular-disease hypothesis has 
recently been explored in several large prospective cohort studies, but the 
findings were not all consistent. In several randomized, small-scale trials 
using subjects with existing vascular disease, data indicate benefits associated 
with vitamin E and beta carotene. Over the next several years, data from a 
number of ongoing primary prevention trials and proposed secondary prevention 
trials should determine whether antioxidant vitamins decrease risk of vascular 
disease."
8474442,"Previous analysis of the hsp26 gene of Drosophila melanogaster has shown that in 
addition to the TATA box and the proximal and distal heat shock elements (HSEs) 
(centered at -59 and -340, relative to the start site of transcription), a 
segment of (CT)n repeats at -135 to -85 is required for full heat shock 
inducibility (R.L. Glaser, G.H. Thomas, E.S. Siegfried, S.C.R. Elgin, and J.T. 
Lis, J. Mol. Biol. 211:751-761, 1990). This (CT)n element appears to contribute 
to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized 
nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive 
(DH) sites (Q. Lu, L.L. Wallrath, B.D. Allan, R.L. Glaser, J.T. Lis, and S.C.R. 
Elgin, J. Mol. Biol. 225:985-998, 1992). Inspection of the sequences upstream of 
hsp26 has revealed an additional (CT)n element at -347 to -341, adjacent to the 
distal HSE. We have analyzed the contribution of this distal (CT)n element (-347 
to -341), the proximal (CT)n element (-135 to -85), and the two HSEs both to the 
formation of the chromatin structure and to heat shock inducibility. hsp26 
constructs containing site-directed mutations, deletions, substitutions, or 
rearrangements of these sequence elements have been fused in frame to the 
Escherichia coli lacZ gene and reintroduced into the D. melanogaster genome by 
P-element-mediated germ line transformation. Chromatin structure of the 
transgenes was analyzed (prior to gene activation) by DNase I or restriction 
enzyme treatment of isolated nuclei, and heat-inducible expression was monitored 
by measuring beta-galactosidase activity. The results indicate that mutations, 
deletions, or substitutions of either the distal or the proximal (CT)n element 
affect the chromatin structure and heat-inducible expression of the transgenes. 
These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are 
bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. In contrast, 
the HSEs are required for heat-inducible expression but play only a minor role 
in establishing the chromatin structure of the transgenes. Previous analysis 
indicates that prior to heat shock, these HSEs appear to be free of protein. Our 
results suggest that GAGA factor, an abundant protein factor required for normal 
expression of many Drosophila genes, and heat shock factor, a specific 
transcription factor activated upon heat shock, play distinct roles in gene 
regulation: the GAGA factor establishes and/or maintains the DH sites prior to 
heat shock induction, while the activated heat shock factor recognizes and binds 
HSEs located within the DH sites to trigger transcription."
8475937,"The thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are disorders in which the body's 
tissues are resistant to the effects of thyroid hormone. Generalized resistance 
to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland 
and in most or all of the peripheral tissues. Affected individuals have elevated 
serum thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) but are usually clinically euthyroid and 
require no treatment. Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH) 
is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland but not in peripheral 
tissues. Patients have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and normal or 
elevated TSH levels and are clinically thyrotoxic. Therapy is usually necessary, 
but current choices are not completely satisfactory. Selective peripheral 
resistance to thyroid hormone (PerRTH) is characterized by resistance in 
peripheral tissues but not in the pituitary. The only patient thus far described 
had normal serum thyroid hormone and TSH levels but was clinically hypothyroid 
and improved with thyroid hormone administration. All of these disorders are 
probably more common than is generally recognized and are often misdiagnosed and 
inappropriately treated. GRTH, in most cases studied, results from a mutation in 
the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene causing an amino acid substitution in or 
a partial or complete deletion of the thyroid hormone-binding domain of the 
receptor. The causes of PRTH and PerRTH remain to be determined."
8476169,"Although 5% of all cases of congenital deafness are caused by Pendred's 
syndrome, there are few reports in the literature. Seven patients with Pendred's 
syndrome in three families living in the same village were detected. For that 
reason, the syndrome is reviewed in light of the literature. The sex 
distribution of the patients with Pendred's syndrome and their families was 
recorded. We tested for thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid-stimulating 
hormone, triiodothyronine resin uptake, and perchlorate, and performed caloric 
testing. In one patient, subtotal thyroidectomy was performed. In the 
histopathologic study, a thyroid nodule filled with colloid was found. 
Chromosome studies showed no anomalies in any patient. Five of the patients were 
deaf-mutes. We observed that the parents were cousins in all three families. 
These families also had healthy children, and the existence of the syndrome in 
both sexes points to an autosomal recessive trait."
8478553,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a complicated degenerative disorder which can 
be chronic or acute in nature. Its etiology is unclear although it has been 
associated with both cell- and humoral-mediated autoimmune mechanisms. 
Pathophysiologic effects of the disease include inflammation, demyelination of 
peripheral nerves, loss of granular bodies and degeneration of the basement 
membrane of the Schwann cell. This results in ascending paralysis and loss of 
cranial nerve function. Manifestations may be acute or chronic, and temporary or 
permanent, depending upon the degree of neuronal destruction. Due to the 
pervasive nature of GBS, nursing care is a challenge. Assessment of motor, 
respiratory and cardiac function is of key importance. Total care of the patient 
focuses on risks related to impaired mobility and ineffective airway clearance. 
Psychosocial care and patient education are also integral components of care."
8479463,"BACKGROUND: Interest in the antioxidant vitamin E as a possible protective 
nutrient against coronary disease has intensified with the recognition that 
oxidized low-density lipoprotein may be involved in atherogenesis.
METHODS: In 1980, 87,245 female nurses 34 to 59 years of age who were free of 
diagnosed cardiovascular disease and cancer completed dietary questionnaires 
that assessed their consumption of a wide range of nutrients, including vitamin 
E. During follow-up of up to eight years (679,485 person-years) that was 97 
percent complete, we documented 552 cases of major coronary disease (437 
nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 115 deaths due to coronary disease).
RESULTS: As compared with women in the lowest fifth of the cohort with respect 
to vitamin E intake, those in the top fifth had a relative risk of major 
coronary disease of 0.66 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.87) after 
adjustment for age and smoking. Further adjustment for a variety of other 
coronary risk factors and nutrients, including other antioxidants, had little 
effect on the results. Most of the variability in intake and reduction in risk 
was attributable to vitamin E consumed as supplements. Women who took vitamin E 
supplements for short periods had little apparent benefit, but those who took 
them for more than two years had a relative risk of major coronary disease of 
0.59 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.91) after adjustment for age, 
smoking status, risk factors for coronary disease, and use of other antioxidant 
nutrients (including multi-vitamins).
CONCLUSIONS: Although these prospective data do not prove a cause-and-effect 
relation, they suggest that among middle-aged women the use of vitamin E 
supplements is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. 
Randomized trials of vitamin E in the primary and secondary prevention of 
coronary disease are being conducted; public policy recommendations about the 
widespread use of vitamin E should await the results of these trials."
8479464,"BACKGROUND: The oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins increases 
their incorporation into the arterial intima, an essential step in 
atherogenesis. Although dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, carotene, and 
vitamin E, have been hypothesized to prevent coronary heart disease, prospective 
epidemiologic data are sparse.
METHODS: In 1986, 39,910 U.S. male health professionals 40 to 75 years of age 
who were free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, diabetes, and 
hypercholesterolemia completed detailed dietary questionnaires that assessed 
their usual intake of vitamin C, carotene, and vitamin E in addition to other 
nutrients. During four years of follow-up, we documented 667 cases of coronary 
disease.
RESULTS: After controlling for age and several coronary risk factors, we 
observed a lower risk of coronary disease among men with higher intakes of 
vitamin E (P for trend = 0.003). For men consuming more than 60 IU per day of 
vitamin E, the multivariate relative risk was 0.64 (95 percent confidence 
interval, 0.49 to 0.83) as compared with those consuming less than 7.5 IU per 
day. As compared with men who did not take vitamin E supplements, men who took 
at least 100 IU per day for at least two years had a multivariate relative risk 
of coronary disease of 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.84). 
Carotene intake was not associated with a lower risk of coronary disease among 
those who had never smoked, but it was inversely associated with the risk among 
current smokers (relative risk, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.11 to 
0.82) and former smokers (relative risk, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 
0.38 to 0.94). In contrast, a high intake of vitamin C was not associated with a 
lower risk of coronary disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These data do not prove a causal relation, but they provide 
evidence of an association between a high intake of vitamin E and a lower risk 
of coronary heart disease in men. Public policy recommendations with regard to 
the use of vitamin E supplements should await the results of additional studies."
8521118,"Serum IgA class antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) are increased in untreated 
patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and it has been 
suggested that salivary IgA-AGA measurements could be used as a non-invasive 
screening test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. In the present study salivary 
and serum IgA-AGA were measured by an ELISA test in 10 untreated patients with 
DH. The results were compared to IgA-AGA levels in nine patients with DH on a 
long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 20 healthy control subjects on an 
ordinary diet. The mean serum but not salivary IgA-AGA concentrations were 
significantly higher in the untreated than in the patients with DH on a 
long-term GFD. When the 10 untreated patients with DH adhered to a GFD for 3 
months, the rash disappeared and the mean serum IgA-AGA decreased to normal 
levels, but no change was found in the mean salivary IgA-AGA concentration. 
These results show that serum but not salivary IgA-AGA measurements are suitable 
for monitoring GFD treatment in patients with DH. The discrepancy between the 
serum and salivary IgA-AGA concentrations suggests that systemic and salivary 
IgA-AGA responses are controlled separately."
8521555,"BACKGROUND: The genes for the long QT syndrome (LQTS) linked to chromosomes 3 
(LQT3) and 7 (LQT2) were identified as SCN5A, the cardiac Na+ channel gene, and 
as HERG, a K+ channel gene. These findings opened the possibility of attempting 
gene-specific control of ventricular repolarization. We tested the hypothesis 
that the QT interval would shorten more in LQT3 than in LQT2 patients in 
response to mexiletine and also in response to increases in heart rate.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen LQTS patients were studied. Six LQT3 and 7 LQT2 
patients were treated with mexiletine, and its effects on QT and QTc were 
measured. Mexiletine significantly shortened the QT interval among LQT3 patients 
(QTc from 535 +/- 32 to 445 +/- 31 ms, P < .005) but not among LQT2 patients 
(QTc from 530 +/- 79 to 503 +/- 60 ms, P = NS). LQT3 patients (n = 7) shortened 
their QT interval in response to increases in heart rate much more than LQT2 
patients (n = 4) and also more than 18 healthy control subjects (9.45 +/- 3.3 
versus 3.95 +/- 1.97 and 2.83 +/- 1.33, P < .05; data expressed as percent 
reduction in QT per 100-ms shortening in RR). Among these patients, there is 
also a trend for LQT2 patients to have syncope or cardiac arrest under emotional 
or physical stress and for LQT3 patients to have cardiac events either at rest 
or during sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate differential responses of 
LQTS patients to interventions targeted to their specific genetic defect. These 
findings also suggest that LQT3 patients may be more likely to benefit from Na+ 
channel blockers and from cardiac pacing because they would be at higher risk of 
arrhythmia at slow heart rates. Conversely, LQT2 patients may be at higher risk 
to develop syncope under stressful conditions because of the combined 
arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines with the insufficient adaptation of 
their QT interval when heart rate increases."
8521760,"Alteplase is the product of recombinant DNA technology and is chemically 
identical to endogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator: Plasminogen is 
converted to plasmin by alteplase, and fibrinolysis of blood thrombi is 
subsequently stimulated. Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of 
choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of 
intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also 
been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and 
urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion. However, its 
use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as 
extensively documented. Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of 
intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial 
alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on 
the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial 
haemorrhage are scarce. Little clinical benefit is apparent in patients with 
unstable angina, although careful use may be warranted in those with definite 
pretreatment coronary thrombi. Of concern, there is a suggestion that general 
use of alteplase in patients with unstable angina may be associated with 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction. The incidence of major haemorrhage 
associated with alteplase therapy increases with increasing dose and appears to 
be similar to that seen with other fibrinolytic agents. Thus, further 
well-designed studies of the use of alteplase in ischaemic stroke and cerebral 
haemorrhage are required. However, a small subset of patients with unstable 
angina and definite pretreatment coronary thrombi may benefit from alteplase 
therapy. Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein 
thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place 
in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism."
8523985,"Despite the known effectiveness of anti-inflammatory therapy in reducing 
reperfusion injury, no studies to date involve the use of anti-inflammatory 
therapy in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury in fasciocutaneous flaps. 
Dexamethasone (a phospholipase A2 inhibitor) and specific cyclooxygenase and 
lipoxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin and BW755C) were administered to rats with 
ischemic island groin (fasciocutaneous) flaps. Significant improvement in 
ischemic flap survival was found with dexamethasone and BW755C. The mode of 
action of dexamethasone was not specifically investigated in our study; however, 
it may suppress neutrophil function and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in 
its shared ability with BW755C to reduce the formation of leukotrienes. 
Dexamethasone could be applied in the clinical setting to reduce ischemic flap 
loss by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response to reperfused 
ischemic-damaged tissue."
8526413,"The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable connective tissue 
disorders that share the common features of skin hyperextensibility, articular 
hypermobility, and tissue fragility. Considerable clinical and genetic 
heterogeneity exists, and more than nine separate forms have been recognized. 
Recent advances in the molecular analysis of EDS have identify defects 
responsible for EDS VI (homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the 
lysyl-hydroxylase gene), EDS VIIA and EDS VIIB (mutations in the type I 
collagene genes), EDS VIIC (deficiency of procollagen N-proteinase), EDS IX 
(mutations in the MNK gene), and EDS IV (mutations in the type III collagen 
gene). Of the various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome the most severe is type IV 
(EDS IV). Early studies showed that fibroblasts from EDS IV patients secreted 
lower than normal amounts of type III procollagen (Pope et al., 1975). Later, 
the disease was linked to COL3A1, the gene encoding this protein. More recently, 
with the publication of full length cDNA and partial characterisation of the 
gene structure, detailed analysis of mutations in EDS IV patients has become 
possible. Nineteen different mutations in the type III procollagen gene have 
been reported in different families with EDS IV. Recent results support the 
hypothesis that in EDS IV, dominant inheritance should be assumed, in sporadic 
cases also, unless proven otherwise. Very little is known about the genetics or 
biochemicals defects responsible for the others EDS subtypes, but with the 
applications of the tools of molecular biology, analysis of these defects if now 
within reach."
8527967,"Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse 
small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. It occurs 
predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses 
and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients 
with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special 
staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three 
cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous 
bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another 
case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be 
impaired and iron is pooled within macrophages."
8528106,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and the NF1 gene 
product, neurofibromin, can downregulate the N-ras gene. Because the N-ras gene 
is often mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we wondered if the NF1 
gene might be mutated in those AML samples not having N-ras mutations. We 
investigated the mutational status of the N-ras gene and the FLR exon of codons 
1371-1423 of the open reading frame of the full-length NF1 cDNA, which has a 
strong homology with the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), 
especially for a stretch of three consecutive amino acids (F, L, R), by 
single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing in 
samples from patients with AML. Of 48 AML patients, 10 (21%) had point 
(missense) mutations of the N-ras gene involving codons 12, 13 and 61. However, 
mutations in the FLR exon of the NF1 gene were not detected in any of the AML 
samples. We also examined the difference of clinical response to induction 
therapy between AML patients with and without N-ras mutation. A significantly 
lower rate of complete remission was noted in individuals with N-ras gene 
mutations. These results suggest that mutation of the NF1 gene, at least in the 
FLR exon, is very rare in AML and the NF1 gene probably is not a functional 
complement of the N-ras gene mutation. The presence of N-ras gene mutation may 
be associated with a lower clinical response to antileukemic therapy."
8530259,"In order to evaluate the mode of action of dexamethasone (DEX) on 
macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and to understand its association with nitric 
oxide (NO) production, the effect of DEX on macrophage- and spermine 
NONOate-mediated cytotoxicity was studied. DEX caused 100% inhibition of 
cytotoxicity by LPS- and IFN gamma-activated macrophages whereas it caused only 
partial inhibition of NO production. Inhibition of macrophage-mediated 
cytotoxicity by DEX was not reversed by supplementation of rTNF alpha. The 
partial inhibition of NO production by DEX was due to partial inhibition of iNOS 
mRNA expression. Incubation of macrophages with DEX for up to 24 h prior to 
activation did not cause further inhibition of NO production. DEX failed to 
inhibit NO production if added 6 h after addition of LPS and IFN gamma. Addition 
of P815 cells after the onset of NO production resulted in partial restoration 
of cytotoxicity in DEX-treated macrophages. Incubation of P815 cells with 
spermine NONOate, a synthetic NO donor, resulted in P815 cell lysis, which was 
dose-dependent, had a lag phase of 3 h and was blocked by hemoglobin. DEX also 
inhibited spermine NONOate-mediated tumor cell lysis, indicating that DEX may 
have a protective effect on tumor targets. These results indicate that DEX 
inhibits macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity by decreasing NO production and by 
inhibiting the cytotoxic effects of NO on the target cells."
8535646,"Increasingly, methotrexate (MTX) and sulphasalazine (SASP) are used initially 
for second-line therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although SASP and MTX are 
commonly used, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs control the inflammation 
that characterizes RA have remained obscure. Results from my laboratory indicate 
that these agents share a mode of action; the anti-inflammatory effects of both 
SASP and MTX are due, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, to their capacity to 
enhance adenosine release at inflamed sites. This mode of action suggests that 
the development of agents that directly alter adenosine metabolism may lead to 
new, more effective and safer antirheumatic drugs than those currently 
available."
8536072,"Ameloblasts responsible for tooth enamel formation are classified into two 
different phases: secretion and maturation. At the transition between these 
secretion and maturation stages, a considerable number of cells die. In this 
study, we examined the morphology of degenerating ameloblasts by conventional 
electron microscopy, and DNA cleavage in degenerating ameloblast nuclei by the 
in situ terminal transferase assay. The results suggest that apoptosis 
(programmed cell death) in ameloblasts, including DNA ligation is induced at the 
transitional stage. The nuclear fragments, chromatin condensation and DNA 
relocation in apoptotic nuclei were examined quantitatively by post-embedding 
anti-DNA immunogold electron microscopy and the in situ terminal transferase 
assay combined with electron microscopy. Numerical analysis revealed that 
immunogold labeling density in the condensed chromatin of apoptotic nuclei was 
comparable on the average to that in the perinuclear heterochromatin of normal 
nuclei, and that individual apoptotic nuclear fragments exhibited highly 
variable to that of normal heterochromatin, to fragments with densities twice as 
high as that of normal heterochromatin. The in situ terminal transferase assay 
combined with electron microscopy detected DNA ends exposed by ultrathin 
sectioning as well as DNA cleavage by a putative endonuclease. In conclusion, 
the state of the DNA, including its ligation and degeneration, changes gradually 
during chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation of apoptosis."
8538346,"BACKGROUND: An increased frequency of hyperechogenic bowel on ultrasound has 
been reported in fetuses with cystic fibrosis (CF) and trisomy-21. However, the 
diagnostic application of this observation has been hampered by the absence of a 
means of measuring echogenicity.
METHODS: We devised an ultrasonic grading system in which echogenicity was 
quantified by linear gain reduction and comparison with fetal iliac crest. From 
7400 second-trimester ultrasound referrals, 145 patients were identified as 
having a fetus with abnormally echogenic bowel. They were offered genetic 
counselling, parental and (if appropriate) CF carrier testing, and amniocentesis 
for karyotype and CF status if parents were informative. Follow-up was to 4 
months of age.
FINDINGS: Of 40 fetuses with mild increase in bowel sonodensity (grade 1), none 
had CF or aneuploidy. Of 81 patients identified with a moderate increase (grade 
2), 2 had trisomy 21 and 2 had CF. And of 24 pregnancies with a pronounced 
increase (grade 3), 5 had CF and 6 had trisomy-21.
INTERPRETATION: Parental CF carrier testing and amniocentesis to identify 
aneuploidy or fetal CF status has a high positive ascertainment rate in fetuses 
with echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3."
8541855,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of heritable disorders of connective 
tissue with skin, ligaments and blood vessels being the main sites affected. The 
commonest variant (EDS II) exhibits an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance 
and is characterized by joint hypermobility, cigarette paper scars, lax skin and 
excessive bruising. As yet no gene has been linked to EDS II, nor has linkage 
been established to a specific region of the genome. However, several candidate 
genes encoding proteins of the extracellular matrix have been excluded. Using an 
intragenic simple sequence repeat polymorphism, we report linkage of the COL5A1 
gene, which encodes the alpha 1(V) chain of type V collagen, to EDS II. A 
maximum LOD score (Zmax) for linkage of 8.3 at theta = 0.00 was generated for a 
single large pedigree."
8543701,"The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by burning and painful sensations of 
the mouth in the absence of significant mucosal abnormalities. For patients in 
whom no causative factor can be identified, empiric antifungal, nutritional, and 
estrogen replacement therapy can be initiated. If these fail, long-term therapy 
with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and clonazepam can be considered. Topical 
capsaicin and laser therapy have been reported beneficial in a few patients."
8543806,"Lymphocyte recognition of characteristic structural features in microbial DNA 
may contribute to immune defense by promoting protective immune responses. The 
dinucleotide CpG is significantly under-represented in vertebrate DNA and is 
usually methylated. In contrast, CpG dinucleotides are generally present at the 
expected frequency in bacterial DNA and are unmethylated. These unmethylated CpG 
motifs induce B cells to secrete IL-6 and IgM, and can induce NK and CD4+ T 
cells to produce the immunoregulatory Th1 cytokine, IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma 
inhibits IgM secretion that is triggered by a different bacterial product, LPS. 
The present study demonstrates that in contrast to its antagonistic interaction 
with LPS, IFN-gamma causes a dose-dependent increase in the level of IgM 
secretion induced by CpG DNA. Like IgM secretion, B cell secretion of IL-6 more 
than doubles after the addition of exogenous IFN-gamma. Mice with disrupted 
IFN-gamma genes produced less than half as much IL-6 and IgM in response to CpG 
DNA, supporting the hypothesis that CpG-induced IFN-gamma production contributes 
to the B cell response. In contrast to its promotion of IL-6 and IgM secretion, 
IFN-gamma did not significantly affect the spleen cell proliferation activated 
by CpG motifs. These results indicate that IFN-gamma produced by T and NK cells 
after CpG DNA stimulation contributes to the B cell production of IL-6 and the 
subsequent Ig production. These studies provide further evidence that the immune 
system responds to CpG motifs in bacterial DNA by activating a coordinated set 
of humoral and cellular responses."
8545576,"BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome refers to the clinical triad of hereditary 
nephritis, sensorineural deafness, and ocular abnormalities. Ultrastructural 
findings in the lens capsule and in the renal glomeruli have provided evidence 
that abnormal basement membranes are elaborated in affected tissues of patients 
with this disorder. Recently, the results of several linkage studies have 
allowed the genetic defect in Alport syndrome to be mapped to a locus that codes 
for a subtype of type IV collagen (alpha 5) known to be present in glomerular 
basement membranes. In spite of these advances, the nature of the retinal flecks 
in Alport syndrome and the visual consequences of the flecks remain 
controversial.
METHODS: Detailed psychophysical and electrophysiologic testing was performed in 
a young man with Alport syndrome. The concurrence of an unusually extensive 
fleck retinopathy and unilateral pseudophakia afforded a unique opportunity to 
assess the effect of the flecks on retinal function.
RESULTS: No sensory deficits were present in the eye with clear media.
CONCLUSION: Macular flecks in Alport syndrome are not associated with 
demonstrable retinal dysfunction. The authors address questions about the nature 
and pathogenesis of the flecks in light of new clinical and genetic information."
8548797,"We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta 
(IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer 
complex (enhanceosome). This multicomponent complex includes at least three 
distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y). 
Both the in vitro assembly and in vivo transcriptional activity of this complex 
require a precise helical relationship between individual transcription 
factor-binding sites. In addition, HMG I(Y), which binds specifically to three 
sites within the enhancer, promotes cooperative binding of transcriptional 
factors in vitro and is required for transcriptional synergy between these 
factors in vivo. Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and 
function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome."
8550759,"The uptake and metabolism of T3 and rT3 was studied in human liver-derived HepG2 
cells. The results showed a saturable, time-dependent, and ouabain-sensitive 
increase in nuclear bound T3. The effects of ouabain (0.5 mmol/L) and unlabeled 
T3 (10 nmol/L and 10 mumol/L) were much more pronounced at the nuclear level, 
suggesting the presence of a nonspecific component in total cellular binding. 
Nuclear binding of rT3 remained below the detection limit in all experiments. 
Comparison of rT3 metabolism in HepG2 cells and primary cultures of rat 
hepatocytes showed an approximately 10-fold lower iodide production in HepG2 
cells. Iodide production was decreased in the presence of ouabain and almost 
absent in the presence of propylthiouracil (100 mumol/L). Our data confirmed the 
presence of a carrier-mediated uptake system for both T3 and rT3. Metabolism 
data indicated functional type I deiodinase activity in HepG2 cells, the 
presence of glucuronidating enzymes, and the absence of thyroid hormone 
sulfotransferase activity. Based on these data, we propose that HepG2 cells 
provide an appropriate model for thyroid hormone handling by human liver. In 
addition, we suggest that in human liver sulfation of thyroid hormone, and 
therefore deiodination of T3 is of only minor importance."
8552676,"Infantile Pompe disease is a fatal genetic muscle disorder caused by a 
deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase, a glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme. We 
constructed a plasmid containing a 5'-shortened human acid alpha-glucosidase 
cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, as well as the aminoglycoside 
phosphotransferase and dihydrofolate reductase genes. Following transfection in 
dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, selection with 
Geneticin, and amplification with methotrexate, a cell line producing high 
levels of the alpha-glucosidase was established. In 48 hr, the cells cultured in 
Iscove's medium with 5 mM butyrate secreted 110-kDa precursor enzyme that 
accumulated to 91 micrograms.ml-1 in the medium (activity, > 22.6 
mumol.hr-1.ml-1). This enzyme has a pH optimum similar to that of the mature 
form, but a lower Vmax and Km for 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucoside. It is 
efficiently taken up by fibroblasts from Pompe patients, restoring normal levels 
of acid alpha-glucosidase and glycogen. The uptake is blocked by mannose 
6-phosphate. Following intravenous injection, high enzyme levels are seen in 
heart and liver. An efficient production system now exists for recombinant human 
acid alpha-glucosidase targeted to heart and capable of correcting fibroblasts 
from patients with Pompe disease."
8553408,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of lubeluzole 
in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute (< 6 hours) ischemic stroke in 
the carotid artery territory.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial was 
conducted in 232 patients. Because treatment was administered within 6 hours and 
a CT scan was not mandatory before the start of treatment, 39 patients with 
either an intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemic stroke in the vertebrobasilar 
circulation were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis as prespecified in 
the protocol. Of the 193 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the carotid 
artery territory (target population), 61 received placebo, 66 lubeluzole 7.5 mg 
over 1 hour followed by 10 mg/d for 5 days, and 66 lubeluzole 15 mg over 1 hour 
followed by 20 mg/d for 5 days.
RESULTS: The trial, initially aimed at a patient inclusion of 270, was 
terminated prematurely according to the advice of the Safety Committee because 
of an imbalance in mortality between the treatment groups. Mortality rates at 
the final follow-up of 28 days for placebo, lubeluzole 10 mg/d, and lubeluzole 
20 mg/d were, respectively, 18%, 6%, and 35% in the target population, results 
that were confirmed in the intent-to-treat population. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis showed that the lower mortality in the lubeluzole 10 mg/d 
group was significantly in favor of the 10 mg/d treatment (P = .019). The higher 
mortality rate in the 20 mg/d group could be explained, at least in part, by an 
imbalance at randomization that led to a higher number of patients in that group 
with severe ischemic stroke. A total of 26 of 66 patients (39%) who received 
lubeluzole 10 mg/d had a score on the Barthel Index of > 70 at day 28, 
indicating no or mild disability, compared with 21 of 61 (34%) in the placebo 
group and 19 of 66 (29%) in the lubeluzole 20 mg/d group (P = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, the dosage regimen of 7.5 
mg over 1 hour followed by 10 mg/d of intravenous lubeluzole is safe and 
statistically significantly reduced mortality. Further clinical trials in a 
larger number of patients are ongoing to confirm efficacy."
8556817,"Mutation screening of the glucocerebrosidase gene by SSCP analysis revealed an 
abnormal pattern of exon 10 in two unrelated Italian Gaucher patients. Direct 
sequencing of the mutated samples identified a G6490-->A transition. The same 
mutation has been described before in a Japanese patient with Gaucher disease 
type III. The clinical phenotype of our patients was type I in one whose second 
allele carried the N370S mutation and type II in the other one with a L444P 
mutation. In this latter the G6490-->A substitution cancels a normal Msp I site, 
while on the opposite chromosome the T6433-->C mutation (L444P) introduces a new 
Msp I site. Thus, digestion with Msp I of the amplified exon 10 is a useful 
method for identifying the two mutations simultaneously."
8559285,"Glucocorticoids have been shown repeatedly to inhibit the release of prolactin 
(PRL) in the rat but their site and mode of action is unknown. In the present 
study, we used an in vitro model to examine the requirement for protein 
synthesis for dexamethasone to suppress the release of immunoreactive (ir)-PRL 
release from the rat pituitary gland. In addition we have performed a series of 
in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the potential role in this 
regard of lipocortin 1 (LC1), a protein shown previously not only to mediate 
aspects of the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions of the 
glucocorticoids but also to contribute to the regulatory actions of the steroids 
in the brain-neuroendocrine system. In vitro, the release of ir-PRL from rat 
anterior pituitary tissue initiated by submaximal concentrations of VIP (10 nM). 
TRH (10 nM) or the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (100 microM) was reduced 
significantly (p < 0.01) by preincubation (2 h) of the tissue with dexamethasone 
(0.1 microM). By contrast, ir-PRL release evoked by a submaximal concentration 
of the L-Ca2+ channel opener BAY K8644 (10 microM) was unaffected by the steroid 
although readily antagonised (p < 0.01) by nifedipine (1-100 microM). Exposure 
of the pituitary tissue to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) also caused a pronounced 
and highly significant increase in de novo protein synthesis, as assessed by the 
incorporation of 14C-lysine into the tissue (p < 0.001). This response was 
reduced markedly by the inclusion of the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, 
actinomycin-D (0.5 micrograms/ml) or cycloheximide (1.0 micrograms/ml), in the 
incubation medium (p < 0.001), both of which also effectively abrogated (p < 
0.01) the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of the release of ir-PRL evoked by 
TRH. VIP and forskolin. Lipocortin I was readily detectable by Western blotting 
in protein extracts of freshly excised anterior pituitary tissue: a small 
proportion of the protein was found to be attached to the outer surface of the 
cells where it was retained by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Exposure of the 
tissue in vitro to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) or corticosterone (0.1 microM) but 
not 17 beta-oestradiol (0.1 microM) caused a pronounced increase in the amount 
of LC1 attached to the outer surface of the cells and concomitant decrease in 
the LC1 content of the intracellular LC1 pool. Addition of an N-terminal LC1 
fragment. LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml), to the incubation medium reduced 
significantly (p < 0.01) the increases in ir-PRL release induced in vitro by VIP 
(10 nM) and forskolin (100 microM). By contrast, at all concentrations tested. 
LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml) failed to influence (p < 0.05) the highly significant 
(p < 0.01) ir-PRL response to TRH (10 nM). Similarly, the inhibitory actions of 
dexamethasone (0.1 microM) on the release of ir-PRL induced by VIP (10 nM) or 
forskolin (100 microM) but not by TRH (10 nM) were substantially reversed (p < 
0.01) by a specific monoclonal anti-LC1 antibody while an isotype-matched 
control antibody was without effect. In vivo, rats pretreated with either a 
polyclonal anti LC1 antiserum (anti-LC1 pAb, 1 ml/day s.c. for 2 days) or a 
corresponding volume of non-immune sheep serum (NSS) responded to stress 
(laparotomy under ether anaesthesia) with significant (p < 0.05) increases in 
the serum ir-PRL concentration. In the NSS-treated group, the ir-PRL response to 
stress was effectively inhibited by dexamethasone (100 micrograms/kg i.p.) which 
had no effect on the pre-stress serum ir-PRL concentration. By contrast, in rats 
pretreated with anti-LC1 pAb dexamethasone failed to block the stress-induced 
release of ir-PRL. The results show clearly that the inhibitory actions of 
dexamethasone on PRL release are dependent on de novo protein synthesis and 
provide novel evidence for the involvement of both LC1-dependent and 
LC1-independent mechanisms."
8561893,"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play diverse roles in 
controlling many developmental events. Although a great deal is understood about 
how bHLH factors activate gene transcription via E-box DNA consensus sequences, 
studies of bHLH factor function in higher eukaryotes often have been hindered by 
the presence of multiple family members. As a first step in developing a 
simplified in vivo system to examine bHLH factor activities, we examined whether 
the bHLH muscle regulatory factors MRF4 and MyoD function appropriately in 
yeast. We show that Gal4-MRF4 fusion proteins, or native MRF4 proteins, activate 
expression of an E-box HIS3 reporter gene whereas MyoD proteins remain inactive. 
Deletion of the MRF4 transcription activation domain (TAD) or point mutations 
that abolish MRF4 DNA interactions inhibit HIS3 expression. Substitution of the 
MRF4 TAD with the Gal4 TAD also produces a functional protein, demonstrating 
that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in 
yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates 
an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family 
members. Using this experimental system, we also demonstrate that mammalian cDNA 
libraries can be screened successfully for cDNAs encoding novel bHLH proteins 
that interact with E-box targets. Thus, this in vivo yeast system provides a 
novel approach to facilitate functional studies of bHLH factor regulation."
8563763,"Recent reports have described a distinct and recurrent pattern of systemic 
malformation that associates craniosynostosis and neurodevelopmental 
abnormalities with many clinical features of the Marfan syndrome (MFS), an 
autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular microfibril caused by defects 
in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, FBN1 (ref. 8). Additional common findings 
include other craniofacial anomalies, hypotonia, obstructive apnea, foot 
deformity, and congenital weakness of the abdominal wall. So far, only 11 cases 
have been reported precluding the assignment of definitive diagnostic criteria. 
While it remains unclear whether these cases represent a discrete clinical 
entity with a single aetiology, they have been pragmatically grouped under the 
rubric Marfanoid-craniosynostosis or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS). Because 
of the significant clinical overlap between MFS and SGS, we proposed that they 
may be caused by allelic mutations. We now report two SGS patients who harbour 
mutations in FBN1. While it remains unclear whether these mutations are 
sufficient for the clinical expression of the entire SGS phenotype, these data 
suggest a role for fibrillin-1 in early craniofacial and central nervous system 
development. Our recent observation that FBN1 transcript is expressed as early 
as the 8-cell stage of human embryogenesis is consistent with this hypothesis."
8565331,"Parental genomic imprinting is the phenomenon in which the behavior of a gene is 
modified, depending on the sex of the transmitting parent [Peterson and Sapienza 
(1993): Annu Rev Genet 27:7-31]. Recent observations have revealed that the 
inheritance patterns, age-of-onset, severity, and etiology of certain human 
diseases can be explained by aberrations in the establishment or the maintenance 
of the imprint. Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], 
malignancy [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): 
Nat Genet 4:110-113], and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [Julier et 
al. (1994) Nature 354:155-159; Bennett et al. (1995) Nat Genet 9:284-292]. We 
review the evidence that implicates an imprinted gene in the INS-IGF2 region of 
chromosome 11p15 in the etiology of IDDM (referred to as the IDDM2 locus) and 
show that in human fetal pancreas, INS is not imprinted, thus providing an 
argument against INS as the candidate gene. We also examine imprinting effects 
on the expression of IGF2 in components of the human immune system believed to 
be important in IDDM and show imprinted expression in fetal thymus as early as 
15 weeks gestation. We demonstrate further that in the circulating mononuclear 
cells of two individuals, lectin-stimulated IGF2 transcription was biallelic, 
indicating relaxation of imprinting, whereas in one individual, transcription 
was monoallelic. Finally, we review the current available data supporting a role 
for insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the immune system and, more 
specifically, discuss the evidence supporting a role for the IGFs in the 
prevention of apoptosis. These data have led us to formulate a novel hypothesis 
that could mechanistically explain the involvement of the IDDM2 locus in the 
pathogenesis of IDDM."
8566249,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a clinical examination during menstruation and plasma 
CA-125 concentrations to diagnose deep endometriosis.
DESIGN: Prospective study in 61 women scheduled for a laparoscopy, a 
retrospective study in 140 women with deep endometriosis, and a clinical 
validation study in 16 women with painful pelvic nodularities during 
menstruation.
SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, a tertiary referral center.
RESULTS: In the retrospective study, deep endometriosis was detected by routine 
clinical examination in only 36% of women. Lesions infiltrating deeper than 15 
mm were detected in 50%. In the prospective study pelvic nodularities were 
detected by routine clinical examination in 4 women but were detected in 22 by 
clinical examination during menstruation. The latter was highly reliable to 
diagnose deep endometriosis, cystic ovarian endometriosis, and cul-de-sac 
obliteration. CA-125 concentrations were higher during menstruation and 
correlated with deep endometriosis and with deep and cystic ovarian 
endometriosis. Nodularities at clinical examination or follicular phase CA-125 
concentrations > 35 U/mL are useful to decide that a bowel preparation should be 
given, achieving a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 83%. In the clinical 
validation study, deep endometriosis was found in 14 of 16 women.
CONCLUSION: Clinical examination during menstruation can diagnose reliably deep 
endometriosis, cystic ovarian endometriosis, or cul-de-sac adhesions. This test, 
preferentially combined with a follicular phase CA-125 assay, should be used to 
decide whether a preparation for bowel surgery should be given."
8566785,"Circular non-polyadenylated RNA molecules have been identified as stable 
transcription products of the human ETS-1 and mouse Sry genes. RNA 
circularization has been proposed to require two steps. The first step utilizes 
intramolecular base pairing to produce a transient stem-loop structure. The 
second step involves splicing a downstream donor splice site (DSS) to a now 
closely appositioned upstream acceptor splice site (ASS) within the loop. We 
demonstrate that the presence of long inverted repeats (IR) flanking the mouse 
Sry gene leads to the formation of the Sry circular transcript in cultured 
cells. Circularization requires the presence of both IR. As few as 400 
complementary nt are necessary for this process. The presence of the IR does not 
significantly stimulate intermolecular annealing and trans-splicing in vivo."
8567402,"We examined whether heat stress could enhance the sensitivity of human colon 
cancer WiDr cells to topoisomerase II-targeting anticancer agents, etoposide 
(VP-16) and teniposide (VM-26), and also determined the most effective timing 
for the drug administration after exposure to hyperthermia. Both topoisomerase 
II contents and topoisomerase II activity were significantly increased in WiDr 
cells 3 to 12 h after heat stress at 43 degrees C for 1 h, in comparison with 
those immediately after the heat stress. Cytotoxicity by VP-16 was most 
significantly enhanced 3 to 12 h after exposure to 43 degrees C for 1 h, but no 
synergistic effect was observed when the drug was administered immediately after 
the heat stress. A combination of VM-26 with heat stress, but not that of a 
topoisomerase I-targeting camptothecin derivative (CPT-11), or vincristine, 
showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect on WiDr cells. VP-16 alone induced 
cellular accumulation at the G2 + M phase, whereas the combination of VP-16 and 
heat stress further increased the cell population at the G2 + M phase, and 
decreased S-phase cells. A possible application of the combination of VP-16 and 
hyperthermia in clinical use is discussed."
8568672,"1. Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the 
antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the 
Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal 
transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Whole-cell 
patch-clamp techniques were used to study the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels 
expressed by H146 SCLC cells and the effects of LES antibodies on these 
channels. The types of Ca2+ channels were determined using biophysical 
properties and pharmacological sensitivity to several antagonists. 2. Whole-cell 
Ca2+ currents (ICa) in SCLC cells are sensitive to the dihydropyridine (DHP) 
nicardipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA) and omega-agatoxin IVA 
(omega-AgTX IVA). Nicardipine at 100 nM and 10 microM reduced ICa by 35 and 45% 
(n = 38 cells), respectively, while omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) inhibited ICa by 
32% (n = 31). Application of omega-AgTX IVA at 50 and 100 nM to the cancer cells 
decreased ICa by 41 and 42%, respectively (n = 22). 3. Measurement of cell 
membrane capacitance (Cm) revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis underlies 
the secretory activity of SCLC cells. Exocytosis, when induced by step 
depolarizing pulses and measured by increases in Cm, was markedly inhibited by 
nicardipine (10 microM) and omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM). In contrast, omega-CgTX 
GVIA (1 microM) was not as effective in altering increases in Cm. 4. From 
negative (-80 mV) and depolarized (-40 mV) holding potentials, both peak and 
plateau ICa were inhibited by the presence of LES antibodies (1 mg ml-1 IgG). 
LES serum also reduced depolarization-induced increases in Cm by 48% (n = 15). 
5. To determine whether the LES antibodies are downregulating a specific type(s) 
of Ca2+ channel, nicardipine (10 microM), omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) or 
omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM) was applied to tumour cells that had been previously 
exposed to LES serum for 24 h. The most pronounced change was that omega-AgTX 
IVA was 38-84% less effective at reducing ICa after the IgG treatment. The 
effectiveness of nicardipine was diminished by 18% after incubation with the LES 
antibodies, whereas the omega-CgTX GVIA was seen to be more effective. These 
results suggest that LES IgG downregulates P-type Ca2+ channels and, possibly, 
to a lesser extent L-type channels. 6. In view of recent evidence that P-type 
Ca2+ channels mediate cholinergic transmitter release at the mammalian 
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the expression of P-type Ca2+ channels in the SCLC 
cells and the reactivity of LES IgG with these channels support the hypothesis 
that P-type Ca2+ channels in these cancer cells may trigger the autoantibody 
production in this disorder. The antibodies so produced are implicated in the 
functional impairment of the Ca2+ channels characteristic of LES."
8569244,"The anti-hyperglycemic effect of 12 edible plants was studied on 27 healthy 
rabbits, submitted weekly to subcutaneous glucose tolerance tests after gastric 
administration of water, tolbutamide or a traditional preparation of the plant. 
Tolbutamide, Cucurbita ficifolia, Phaseolus vulgaris, Opuntia streptacantha, 
Spinacea oleracea, Cucumis sativus and Cuminum cyminum decrease significantly 
the area under the glucose tolerance curve and the hyperglycemic peak. Brassica 
oleracea var. botrytis, Allium cepa and Allium sativum only decrease the 
hyperglycemic peak. The glycemic decreases caused by Psidium guajava, Brassica 
oleracea and Lactuca sativa var. romana were not significant (P > .05). The 
integration of a menu that includes the edible plants with hypoglycemic activity 
for the control and prevention of diabetes mellitus may be possible and 
recommendable."

8570438,"Hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity are known 
contributing risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery 
disease (CAD). However, they account for only half of all cases of CAD, and the 
complete pathologic process underlying atherosclerosis remains unknown. Growing 
evidence suggests that oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
may be of particular importance in the pathogenesis. Oxidized LDL exhibits 
proatherogenic effects. Therefore, current research has focused on inhibiting 
the oxidation of LDL as a means of inhibiting the atherosclerotic process. One 
such approach is to enhance the endogenous antioxidant defense systems within 
the LDL particle with lipophilic antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and 
beta-carotene, or by supplementing the aqueous-phase antioxidant capacity with 
ascorbic acid. Observational data suggest a protective effect of antioxidant 
supplementation on the incidence of CAD; however, specific doses cannot be 
recommended since the data are inconclusive."
8570657,"Muller proposed that an asexual organism will inevitably accumulate deleterious 
mutations, resulting in an increase of the mutational load and an inexorable, 
ratchet-like, loss of the least mutated class [Muller, H.J. (1964) Mutat. Res. 
1, 2-9]. The operation of Muller's ratchet on real populations has been 
experimentally demonstrated only in RNA viruses. However, these cases are 
exceptional in that the mutation rates of the RNA viruses are extremely high. We 
have examined whether Muller's ratchet operates in Salmonella typhimurium, a 
DNA-based organism with a more typical genomic mutation rate. Cells were grown 
asexually under conditions expected to result in high genetic drift, and the 
increase in mutational load was determined. S. typhimurium accumulated mutations 
under these conditions such that after 1700 generations, 1% of the 444 lineages 
tested had suffered an obvious loss of fitness, as determined by decreased 
growth rate. These results suggest that in the absence of sex and with high 
genetic drift, genetic mechanisms, such as back or compensatory mutations, 
cannot compensate for the accumulation of deleterious mutations. In addition, we 
measured the appearance of auxotrophs, which allowed us to calculate an average 
spontaneous mutation rate of approximately 0.3-1.5 x 10(-9) mutations per base 
pair per generation. This rate is measured for the largest genetic target 
studied so far, a collection of about 200 genes."
8573479,"Prior to the advent of BCG immunotherapy, bladder carcinoma in situ often 
progressed to muscle invasion. Intravesical chemotherapy completely eradicates 
the disease in 50% of patients, but fewer than 20% remain disease free after 5 
years. Complete responses have been reported in 70% or more of BCG treated 
patients, nearly two-thirds of which are durable. Controversy over the optimal 
induction and maintenance regimens for BCG immunotherapy remain, but SWOG 
investigators have demonstrated that complete response rates can be increased 
from the expected 73% to 87% with just three additional BCG instillations given 
at 3 months. In complete responders, maintenance BCG using three weekly 
treatments at 6-month intervals improves long-term complete response rates from 
65% to nearly 90%. Caution must be exercised to avoid serious side effects."
8573724,"The Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid protein homologous to the amino-terminal 
domain of the product of the groucho gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split 
complex. Analysis with a polyclonal antisera specific for the Grg protein 
revealed that Grg is a 25 kd nuclear protein that can participate in specific 
protein-protein interactions. A null mutation of the Grg gene was constructed by 
gene targeting. Mice homozygous for this mutation completed embryogenesis and 
were born, but exhibited varying degrees of post-natal growth deficiency. No 
dosage-sensitive genetic interaction was detected between the Notch1 and Grg 
genes in mice heterozygous for a Notch1 mutant allele and homozygous for the Grg 
null mutation."
8574597,"Infectious complications are frequent and often lethal in patients with uremia. 
Serious alterations in neutrophil function, e.g., phagocytosis, mononuclear cell 
activation, cytokine production, complement activation, T-cell function, and 
adhesion molecule expression, have been documented in uremic patients. Uremia 
per se is a cause of some of these derangements, but much evidence now exists 
that blood-membrane interaction during dialysis is responsible for many of these 
abnormalities. This is particularly true when bio-incompatible cellulose-based 
membranes are used. In many of these patients, newly described granulocyte 
inhibitory proteins (GIP) can be demonstrated. These two proteins, GIP I and II 
(28 kD and 9.5 kD, respectively, in molecular weight), block effective bacterial 
killing, chemotaxis, and oxygen metabolism. It appears that GIP I is a member of 
the lightchain family, and GIP II is the advanced glycosilation end product of 
beta 2-microglobulin. Another inhibitory protein, degranulation inhibitory 
protein (DIP), has been isolated. This protein is 14 kD in molecular weight, and 
is identical to the angioplastic factor angiogenin. DIP levels are significantly 
elevated in patients undergoing dialysis. Much still needs to be learned about 
the interactions of these inhibitory proteins with other soluble inflammatory 
mediators and, in particular, cytokines. It is clear, however, that profound 
derangements in immune function take place during uremia and dialytic therapy. 
Such derangements are likely to play an important role in determining the rate 
of recovery of renal function and the patient's ability to respond to septic 
insults. Further insights into the pathogenesis of uremic-dialytic immune 
dysfunction are already yielding improved patient management and decreased 
infection rates."
8576647,"Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a hydrolase essential for the intracellular 
degradation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. We previously reported a 
rat model of Wolman's disease (Wolman rat) that is deficient for LAL activity. 
In this study, we cloned rat LAL (RLAL) cDNA and investigated abnormal LAL gene 
expression in the Wolman rat. We cloned the RLAL gene from a cDNA library made 
from normal rat liver mRNA using the human LAL cDNA as a probe, subcloned the 
RLAL cDNA into pBlueScript vector, and sequenced it. Next, we constructed a cDNA 
library from a Wolman rat liver, and used the RLAL cDNA as a probe to isolate 
the Wolman RLAL cDNA for comparison. The normal RLAL cDNA contains 3150 bp 
including an 1194 bp open reading frame and three poly A signals at the 3' end. 
The deduced amino acid sequence contained 397 amino acids, showed 79.9% homology 
with human LAL, and had the same functional domains at the same sites as human 
LAL. Northern blot analysis revealed that the RLAL mRNA from normal rat was 3.2 
kb in length, while the RLAL mRNA from Wolman rat was only 1.4 kb. Nucleotide 
sequence analysis showed that Wolman rat LAL cDNA had the same sequence as a 
RLAL cDNA from the 5'-untranslated region to nt 1101, followed by a 60 bp 
replacement from nt 1102 to nt 1161 with poly A signal and a 3' 1.8 kb deletion. 
The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated the substitution of 367Ile to Asn, 
368Pro to stop codon, and deletion of the C-terminal 29 amino acids. Genomic 
Southern blot analysis disclosed a large deletion at the 3' end of the gene. 
These results identify the molecular defect in the Wolman RLAL, and suggest that 
the C-terminus of RLAL is essential for the activity and/or stability of the 
enzyme."
8576966,"We have determined sequences of PCR-amplified B1 elements from hamster and rat 
(Myomorpha), chipmunk (Sciuromorpha), and guinea pig (Caviomorpha). Between 
three and six B1 subfamilies were found in these species. In the phylogenetic 
analysis B1 sequences of hamster, mouse, and rat clustered separately from those 
of chipmunk and those of guinea pig. This is consistent with an independent 
evolution of B1 elements in separate rodent lineages. We exclude the possibility 
of convergent mutations to explain certain diagnostic characters within the 
modern B1 quasi-dimers and view these elements as mosaic structures assembling 
preexisting mutations. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs 
supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., 
from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element."
8577031,"In many mammalian cells, the transport of newly synthesized or externally added 
lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes is depend on their specific recognition by 
receptors for mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). The physiological importance of 
this pathway was confirmed by the finding that fibroblasts from patients with 
mucolipidosis type II (ML-II ; I - cell disease) fail to phosphorylate mannose 
residues on their newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, which results in the 
secretion of a large percentage of their acid hydrolases into the culture 
medium. However, lysosomal enzymes themselves do not contain the any consensus 
amino acid sequences for acquiring the Man-6-P recognition marker. Kornfeld et 
al revealed using cathepsin D-pepsinogen chimera proteins that 
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase recognizes not only oligosaccharides 
but also the three-dimensional structure of the lysosomal enzymes when transfers 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate to lysosomal acid hydrolases."
8577041,"Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive inherited demyelinating disease, which 
is deficient in lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase. Pathophysiological 
characteristics of this disease are extreme demyelination in white matter and 
peripheral nerve, existence of globoid cells, absence of accumulation of main 
substrates, i.e. galactocerebrosidase in tissues and accumulation of psychosine. 
Molecular basis of this disease including isolation of a cDNA for human and 
murine galactocerebrosidase and cloning of genome of this gene are reviewed. The 
trial of gene therapy on twitcher, the mouse model of Krabbe disease, could 
break through on therapy on this progressive demyelinating disease."
8577046,"Schindler disease and Kanzaki disease are caused by a deficient lysosomal 
enzyme, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (E.C.3.2.1.49). Two German children were 
first reported in 1987 and other two Dutch children were recently reported in 
1993. These children were very similar clinically and characterized by maked 
neuroaxonal dystrophy of an infantile onset. This disease (type 1) was named 
Schindler disease. On the other hand, an adult patient with profuse 
angiokeratoma corporis diffusum but minimum involvement in nervous system was 
reported in 1987 from Japan. This disease (type 2) was named Kanzaki disease 
(Mckusick catalog No. 104170). Molecular analyses of these diseases revealed one

molecular studies of these disease were described."
8577251,"Bacillus anthracis plasmid pXO1 carries the structural genes for the three 
anthrax toxin proteins, cya (edema factor), lef (lethal factor), and pag 
(protective antigen). Expression of the toxin genes by B. anthracis is enhanced 
during growth under elevated levels of CO2. This CO2 effect is observed only in 
the presence of another pXO1 gene, atxA, which encodes a transactivator of 
anthrax toxin synthesis. Here we show that transcription of atxA does not appear 
to differ in cells grown in 5% CO2 compared with cells grown in air. Using a new 
efficient method for gene replacement in B. anthracis, we constructed an 
atxA-null mutant in which the atxA-coding sequence on pXO1 is replaced with an 
omega km-2 cassette. Transcription of all three toxin genes is decreased in the 
absence of atxA. The pag gene possesses two apparent transcription start sites, 
P1 and P2; only transcripts with 5' ends mapping to P1 are decreased in the 
atxA-null mutant. Deletion analysis of the pag promoter region indicates that 
the 111 bp region upstream of the P1 site is sufficient for atxA-mediated 
activation of this transcript. The cya and lef genes each have one apparent 
start site for transcription. Transcripts with 5' ends mapping to these sites 
are not detected in the atxA-null mutant. The atxA-null mutant is avirulent in 
mice. Moreover, the antibody response to all three toxin proteins is decreased 
significantly in atxA-null mutant-infected mice. These data suggest that the 
atxA gene product also regulates toxin gene expression during infection."
8584079,"In an open label study 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease suffering 
from end-of-dose akinesia were switched from a treatment with a L-DOPA standard 
formulation to a combined therapy of L-DOPA standard in the morning and L-DOPA 
slow release (levodopa, benserazide, Madopar Depot) at the remaining single 
doses. Substitution of L-DOPA standard by L-DOPA slow release took on average 
2-4 weeks. Patients were subsequently treated for 6 months. Due to a lower 
bioavailability of the slow release formulation--the latter is based on the 
""hydrodynamically balanced system"" (HBS)--, the patients remained initially on 
their time schedule of drug intake but received a higher dose of L-DOPA slow 
release compared to the preceding L-DOPA standard therapy. In 20 centers 37 men 
and 26 women were included into the study. 27 males and 20 females completed the 
6 month treatment period. Before switching, the patients received 438 +/- 213 mg 
a day L-DOPA standard, after conversion, the average dose was 617 +/- 323 mg 
L-DOPA slow release and 107 +/- 95 mg L-DOPA standard a day. Fluctuations during 
the day and at night which were rated according to a newly developed clinical 
5-point rating scale were significantly improved by the treatment regimen from 
2.8 +/- 0.9 to 1.4 +/- 1.2. Additionally, parkinsonian symptoms were 
significantly reduced during the ON-phase as there was a significant decrease of 
the Webster rating score from 12.0 +/- 4.6 to 7.1 +/- 4.0. Quality of life as 
measured by subjective ratings of the patients improved. The tolerability of the 
new formulation of L-DOPA was rated to be good in 51.1% and very good in 48.9%. 
The results of this open label study suggest that the combination of L-DOPA 
standard in the morning and L-DOPA slow release formulation at the following 
time points can be an efficient therapy in parkinsonian patients who suffer form 
L-DOPA related end-of-dose motor akinesia."
8585387,"Observation's analysis of 5 children in age from 9 months to 4 years 11 months 
with tuberous sclerosis was performed. The initial manifestations of disease 
were following: early children form of epilepsy exactly infantile spasms (West 
syndrome) appearance, dermal alterations in the form of depigmented spots as 
well as nonprogressive delay in psychoverbal development. Together with clinical 
symptoms the main criterion in early form of tuberous sclerosis diagnosis 
determination turned out to be brain's specific alterations (tubers) which were 
revealed by computer tomography. The correlation was observed between epileptic 
seizures polymorphism and frequency as well as brain's morphological 
alterations. Derivatives of valproic acid were the basic drugs in treatment of 
epileptic seizures in patients."
8587608,"A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of 
cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was 
recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel. The 
HERG K+ channel is unusual in that it seems to have the architectural plan of 
the depolarization-activated K+ channel family (six putative transmembrane 
segments), yet it exhibits rectification like that of the inward-rectifying K+ 
channels, a family with different molecular structure (two transmembrane 
segments). We have studied HERG channels expressed in mammalian cells and find 
that this inward rectification arises from a rapid and voltage-dependent 
inactivation process that reduces conductance at positive voltages. The 
inactivation gating mechanism resembles that of C-type inactivation, often 
considered to be the 'slow inactivation' mechanism of other K+ channels. The 
characteristics of this gating suggest a specific role for this channel in the 
normal suppression of arrhythmias."
8589282,"Acute renal insufficiency in the setting of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, a 
triad that constitutes adult or pediatric hemolytic uremic syndrome, can be 
associated with or triggered by diverse conditions such as 
verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, viral infections, pregnancy, malignant 
hypertension, scleroderma, renal radiation, allograft rejection, lupus 
erythematosus, and assorted medications such as mitomycin C, cyclosporine, and 
oral contraceptives. Recurrent and de novo hemolytic uremic syndrome occur after 
renal transplantation. Relapses are also common and probably reflect incomplete 
resolution of the initial episode. The major differential diagnoses of hemolytic 
uremic syndrome in the renal allograft include acute vascular rejection, 
cyclosporine, FK506 or antilymphocyte antibody nephrotoxicity, and malignant 
hypertension, all of which may display overlapping clinical and histologic 
features with primary hemolytic uremic syndrome; in such instances, the exact 
diagnosis may be quite difficult. It is possible that the risk of recurrence may 
be reduced by proper timing of transplantation and suitable choice of 
immunosuppressive agents. Intensive plasmapheresis in conjunction with fresh 
frozen plasma and supportive management of renal failure may lessen mortality 
and morbidity even in recurrent hemolytic uremic syndrome after transplantation."
8589603,"Antibody heavy chain variable domains (VH) lacking their light chain (VL) 
partner are prime candidates for the design of minimum-size immunoreagents. To 
obtain structural information about isolated VH domains, a human VH was labelled 
with 15N or doubly labelled with both 15N and 13C and was studied by 
heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Most (90%) of the 1H and 
15N main-chain signals were assigned through two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY 
experiments on the unlabelled VH and three-dimensional heteronuclear multiple 
quantum correlation TOCSY and NOESY experiments on the 15N-labelled VH. Four 
short stretches of the polypeptide chain could only be assigned on the basis of 
three-dimensional HNCA and HN(CO)CA experiments on the 13C-/15N-labelled 
protein. Long-range interstrand backbone NOEs suggest the presence of two 
adjacent beta-sheets formed by altogether nine antiparallel beta-strands. 3JNHC 
alpha H coupling constants and the location of slowly exchanging backbone amides 
support this interpretation. The secondary structure of the isolated VH is 
identical to that of heavy chain variable domains in intact antibodies, where VH 
domains are packed against a VL domain. The backbone assignments of the VH made 
it possible to locate its Protein A binding site. Chemical shift movements after 
complexing with the IgG binding fragment of Protein A indicate binding through 
one of the two beta-sheets of the VH. This beta-sheet is solvent exposed in 
intact antibodies. The Protein A binding site obviously differs from that on the 
Fc portion of immunoglobulins and is unique to members of the human VHIII gene 
subgroup."
8590944,"In order to elucidate further the abnormal myocardial Ca2+ metabolism in 
diabetes mellitus, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and beta-receptors were 
quantified in myocardial membranes of short- and long-term diabetic rats. 
Diabetes was induced by an injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were 
killed 2, 4, 7, 90 and 200 days after STZ. A group of diabetic animals were 
treated with insulin for 20 days following 180 days of untreated diabetes. 
Diabetic animals developed low triiodothyronine syndrome. During short-term 
diabetes, the maximum binding capacity (MBC) for Ca2+ channels was reduced by 
25% at day 4 (p < 0.05) and the beta-receptor MBC was reduced by 48% (p < 0.05). 
A normalizing tendency was observed at day 7 for both receptor types; 
insulin-treated rats did not differ from controls at that time. After 90 and 200 
days of untreated diabetes the Ca2+ channel MBC had increased by 36% and 27%, 
respectively (p < 0.05). Twenty days of strictly regulated blood glucose 
following 180 days of untreated diabetes totally normalized the Ca2+ channel 
MBC. This is in contrast to a previous report where insulin treatment did not 
normalize the Ca2+ channel MBC. Total beta-receptor MBCs did not differ from 
control values 90 and 200 days after STZ. In conclusion, an increase in rat 
myocardial Ca2+ channel MBC during long-term diabetes was fully normalized by 
short-term insulin treatment. The increase in sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels could 
serve to compensate for a defect coupling of the beta-receptor to adenylate 
cyclase. An elevated Ca2+ channel number may, at least theoretically, lead to 
increased Ca2+ flow across the cardiac sarcolemma and in this way contribute to 
the diabetic cardiomyopathy by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration."
8592224,"Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown in 
experimental models to reduce vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 
and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia. To test whether 
treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and 
improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms, a prospective 
randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41 
neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. One thousand 
twenty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.6, 2, or 6 mg/kg per 
day of intravenously administered tirilazad or a placebo containing the citrate 
vehicle. All patients were also treated with intravenously administered 
nimodipine. Patients receiving 6 mg/kg per day of tirilazad had reduced 
mortality (p = 0.01) and a greater frequency of good recovery on the Glasgow 
Outcome Scale 3 months after SAH (p = 0.01) than similar patients treated with 
vehicle. There was a reduction in symptomatic vasospasm in the group that 
received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad; however, the difference was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.048). The benefits of treatment with tirilazad 
were predominantly shown in men rather than in women. There were no material 
differences between the outcomes in the groups treated with 0.6 and 2 mg/kg 
tirilazad per day and the group treated with vehicle. Tirilazad was well 
tolerated at all three dose levels. These observations suggest that tirilazad 
mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome 
in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH."
8592225,"The 21-aminosteroid lipid-peroxidation inhibitor, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), 
recently was shown in a large multinational Phase III clinical trial to decrease 
mortality and improve neurological recovery in patients 3 months after onset of 
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A major tirilazad metabolite in 
animals and man, U-89678 is formed when the 4-5 double bond in the A-ring is 
reduced and has been postulated to contribute significantly to tirilazad's 
neuroprotective effects. In the first experiment of the present study, the 
authors compared the effects of tirilazad and U-89678 on acute blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) damage in rats subjected to SAH via injection of 300 microliters 
of autologous nonheparinized blood under the dura of the left cortex. The rats 
were treated by intravenous administration of either 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg of 
tirilazad or U-89678 10 minutes before and 2 hours after SAH, and BBB damage was 
quantified according to the extravasation of the protein-bound Evans' blue dye 
into the injured cortex 3 hours post-SAH. The results revealed that 0.3 and 1.0 
mg/kg tirilazad significantly reduced SAH-induced BBB damage 35.2% (p < 0.05) 
and 60.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively, in comparison to treatment with vehicle. 
The 0.3- and 1.0-mg/kg doses of U-89678 also decreased injury by 39.1% (p < 
0.05) and 21.3% (not significant), respectively. In the second experiment, the 
investigators assessed the relative abilities of tirilazad and U-89678 to 
protect cultured neurons from iron-induced lipid peroxidative injury. Fetal 
mouse spinal cord cells were pretreated with 3, 10, or 30 microM tirilazad or 
U-89678 for 1 hour and then exposed to 200 microM ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) 
for 40 minutes. Cell viability was measured in terms of the uptake of 
[3H]alpha-(methyl)-aminoisobutyric acid 45 minutes after the FAS treatment. Both 
compounds enhanced neuronal survival in a concentration-dependent fashion. 
Although the two were equally efficacious, U-89678 was slightly more potent than 
its parent. On the basis of these findings, the authors conclude that the 
tirilazad metabolite, U-89678, possesses vaso- and neuroprotective properties 
that are essentially equivalent to the parent 21-aminosteroid. Hence, U-89678 
probably contributes to the protective effects of tirilazad in SAH and other 
insults to the central nervous system."

8593015,"Valaciclovir (Valtrex), the L-valyl ester of acyclovir, is undergoing clinical 
development for the treatment and suppression of herpesviral diseases. The 
absolute bioavailability of acyclovir from valaciclovir and the metabolic 
disposition of valaciclovir were investigated with healthy volunteers in two 
separate studies. In a randomized, crossover study, 12 fasting healthy 
volunteers each received 1,000 mg of oral valaciclovir and a 1-h intravenous 
infusion of 350 mg of acyclovir. The mean absolute bioavailability of acyclovir 
was 54.2%, a value three to five times that obtained previously with oral 
acyclovir. A similar estimate of 51.3% was made from urinary recovery of 
acyclovir. In the second study, four fasting volunteers received a single oral 
dose of 1,000 mg of [14C]valaciclovir. The majority of plasma radioactivity was 
accounted for by acyclovir, with very low plasma valaciclovir concentrations 
(mean maximum concentration of drug in plasma = 0.19 microM), which were 
undetectable after 3 h postdose. By 168 h, more than 90% of the administered 
radioactive dose was recovered, with approximately 45% in urine and 475 in 
feces. More than 99% of the radioactivity recovered in urine corresponded to 
acyclovir and its known metabolites, 9-(carboxymethoxymethyl)guanine and 
8-hydroxy-9- [(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine, with valaciclovir accounting for 
less than 0.5% of the dose. Acyclovir, but no valaciclovir, was detected in 
fecal samples. These studies show that after oral administration to humans, 
valaciclovir is rapidly and virtually completely converted to acyclovir to 
provide a high level of acyclovir bioavailability in comparison with that 
following oral administration of acyclovir. The plasma acyclovir exposure 
obtained following oral administration of valaciclovir is similar to that 
achieved with doses of intravenous acyclovir, which are effective in the 
treatment and suppression of the less susceptible herpesviral diseases."
8594265,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that triiodothyronine (T(3)) administration 
improves hemodynamic variables and decreases inotropic drug requirements in 
cardiac surgery patients.
DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: Tertiary care medical center.
PATIENTS: A total of 211 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery at high 
risk for requiring inotropic drug support.
INTERVENTION: At release of aortic cross-clamp, patients were randomized to an 
intravenous infusion of T(3) (0.8 microg/kg followed by 0.12 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) 
for 6 hours), dopamine (positive control, 5 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 hours) 
or placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative hemodynamic variables, inotropic support 
requirements, and serum T(3) concentrations.
RESULTS: Mean+/-SEM free T(3) serum concentrations decreased significantly 
during cardiopulmonary bypass in all groups (from 0.0035+/-0.0001 nmol/L 
[0.23+/-0.01 ng/dL] to 0.001+/-0.0001 nmol/L [0.7+/- 0.00 ng/dL]; P=.001) and 
increased to 0.0133+/-0.0004 nmol/L [0.87+/-0.03 ng/dL] (twice normal range; 
P<.001) following initiation of intravenous T(3). Intravenous T(3) did not 
change hemodynamic variables or inotropic drug requirements; however, heart rate 
increased (P<.001), and a trend toward decreased use of inotropic agents was

CONCLUSIONS: Triiodothyronine administration prevents decreases in serum thyroid 
hormone concentrations associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Intravenous T(3) 
does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has 
been previously suggested. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may 
exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as 
an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery."
8594618,"Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear 
thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are 
transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression. 
Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in 
the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating 
levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and 
normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This 
""inappropriate"" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism, 
where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually 
present with goiter and an euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid metabolic state. 
Thus, pituitary resistance results in hypersecretion of TSH, which compensates, 
at least in part, for hormone resistance in peripheral tissues. Despite this 
compensation, clinical effects of RTH can include short stature, delayed bone 
maturation, hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and hearing defects, as well 
as variable features of hyper- and hypothyroidism. With the exception of a 
single sibship, which harbored a deletion of the entire coding sequence of the 
TR beta gene and a recessive pattern of inheritance, all other cases of RTH have 
been inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or have been de novo heterozygous 
mutations of the TR beta gene. The dominant pattern of inheritance is explained 
by the functional properties of the mutant receptors which act in a dominant 
negative manner to block the activity of normal TR alpha and TR beta receptors. 
Now that a large number of different RTH mutations have been identified, it is 
striking that the mutations are clustered within restricted domains in the 
carboxyterminal region of the receptor. Mutations in these regions have been 
shown to preserve critical receptor functions such as dimerization and DNA 
binding, while inactivating other activites such as T3 binding and 
transcriptional activation. The examination of patients with RTH and their 
mutated receptors has provided important insights into the mechanisms of thyroid 
hormone action, the structure-function relationship of the receptors, and the 
molecular mechanisms of dominant negative activity."
8596595,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation is a vascular disease of the brain 
causing headaches, seizures, and cerebral hemorrhage. Familial and sporadic 
cases are recognized, and a gene causing familial disease has been mapped to 
chromosome 7. Hispanic Americans have a higher prevalence of cavernous 
malformation than do other ethnic groups, raising the possibility that affected 
persons in this population have inherited the same mutation from a common 
ancestor.
METHODS: We compared the segregation of genetic markers and clinical cases of 
cavernous malformation in Hispanic-American kindreds with familial disease; we 
also compared the alleles for markers linked to cavernous malformation in 
patients with familial and sporadic cases.
RESULTS: All kindreds with familial disease showed linkage of cavernous 
malformation to a short segment of chromosome 7 (odds supporting linkage, 
4X10(10).1). Forty-seven affected members of 14 kindreds shared identical 
alleles for up to 15 markers linked to the cavernous-malformation gene, 
demonstrating that they had inherited the same mutation from a common ancestor. 
Ten patients with sporadic cases also shared these same alleles, indicating that 
they too had inherited the same mutation. Thirty-three asymptomatic carriers of 
the disease gene were identified, demonstrating the variability and age 
dependence of the development of symptoms and explaining the appearance of 
apparently sporadic cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtually all cases of familial and sporadic cavernous malformation 
among Hispanic Americans of Mexican descent are due to the inheritance of the 
same mutation from a common ancestor."
8599945,"The alpha-amanitin domain or domain f of the largest subunit of RNA polymerases 
is one of the most conserved of these enzymes. We have found that the C-terminal 
part of domain f can be swapped between yeast RNA polymerase II and III. An 
extensive mutagenesis of domain f of C160, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase 
III, was carried out to better define its role and understand the mechanism 
through which C160 participates in transcription. One mutant enzyme, C160-270, 
showed much reduced transcription of a non-specific template at low DNA 
concentrations. Abortive synthesis of trinucleotides in a dinucleotide-primed 
reaction proceeded at roughly wild-type levels, indicating that the mutation did 
not affect the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, but rather the 
transition from abortive initiation to processive elongation. In specific 
transcription assays, on the SUP4 tRNA gene, pausing was extended but the rate 
of RNA elongation between pause sites was not affected. Finally, the rate of 
cleavage of nascent RNA transcripts by halted mutant RNA polymerase was 
increased approximately 10-fold. We propose that the domain f mutation affects 
the transition between two transcriptional modes, one being adopted during 
abortive transcription and at pause sites, the other during elongation between 
pause sites."
8600029,"The E1B 19K protein is a potent apoptosis inhibitor and the putative adenovirus 
Bcl-2 homolog. To investigate the mechanism of apoptosis regulation, 
19K-interacting cellular proteins were identified using the yeast two-hybrid 
system, and Bax was one of seven 19-K interacting clones. Residues 50-78 of Bax 
containing a conserved region designated Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) were 
sufficient for specific binding to both the E1B 19K and Bcl-2 proteins. The 
Bax-E1B 19K interaction was detectable in vitro and in lysates from mammalian 
cells, and Bax expression antagonized E1B 19K protein function. bax mRNA and 
protein levels were p53-inducible with kinetics identical to that of 
p21/Waf-1/Cip-1, and E1B 19K and Bcl-2 expression did not affect Bax or 
p21/Waf-1/Cip-1 accumulation. In cells where p53 was mutant, Bax expression 
induced apoptosis, suggesting that Bax was sufficient for apoptosis, and acted 
downstream of p53. p53 may simultaneously activate the transcription of genes 
required for both growth arrest (p21/Waf-1/Cip-1) and death (bax), and E1B 19K 
and Bcl-2 may act distally and function through interaction with and antagonism 
of Bax to prevent apoptosis. With the death pathway disabled, induction of 
growth arrest by p53 can then be manifested."
8601283,"SECIS elements are stem-loop structures located in the 3' untranslated regions 
(UTRs) of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs that are required for directing 
cotranslational selenocysteine incorporation at UGA codons. In prokaryotes, 
stem-loops mediating selenocysteine incorporation are located immediately 
downstream of the UGA selenocysteine codon, in the coding region. Previous 
characterization studies of the mammalian SECIS elements of type 1 deiodinase, 
glutathione peroxidase, and selenoprotein P showed that conserved nucleotides in 
the loops and unpaired bulges, and base pairing in the stems are required for 
SECIS function. These initial studies utilized approximately 175-230-nt segments 
of the 3'UTRs of the selenoprotein mRNAs. Here we define the minimal functional 
rat type 1 deiodinase SECIS element, a 45-nt segment, the 5' boundary of which 
corresponds precisely to the 5'-most critical conserved nucleotide identified 
previously. We also define base pairing requirements in the stem of this 
element. In view of the presence of SECIS elements in the open reading frames 
(ORFs) of bacterial selenoproteins, we examine the effects in the type 1 
deiodinase of extending the ORF into the SECIS element, and find that this 
dramatically inhibits SECIS function. Finally, we define a minimal spacing 
requirement of 51-111 nt between a eukaryotic UGA selenocysteine codon and SECIS 
element."
8602181,"BACKGROUND: The role of dietary antioxidant vitamins in preventing coronary 
heart disease has aroused considerable interest because of the knowledge that 
oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein may promote atherosclerosis.
METHODS: We studied 34,486 postmenopausal women with no cardiovascular disease 
who in early 1986 completed a questionnaire that assessed, among other factors, 
their intake of vitamins A, E, and C from food sources and supplements. During 
approximately seven years of follow-up (ending December 31, 1992), 242 of the 
women died of coronary heart disease.
RESULTS: In analyses adjusted for age and dietary energy intake, vitamin E 
consumption appeared to be inversely associated with the risk of death from 
coronary heart disease. This association was particularly striking in the 
subgroup of 21,809 women who did not consume vitamin supplements (relative risks 
from lowest to highest quintile of vitamin E intake, 1.0, 0.68, 0.71, 0.42, and 
0.42; P for trend 0.008). After adjustment for possible confounding variables, 
this inverse association remained (relative risks from lowest to highest 
quintile, 1.0, 0.70, 0.76, 0.32, and 0.38; P for trend, 0.004). There was little 
evidence that the intake of vitamin E from supplements was associated with a 
decreased risk of death from coronary heart disease, but the effects of 
high-dose supplementation and the duration of supplement use could not be 
definitely addressed. Intake of vitamins A and C did not appear to be associated 
with the risk of death form coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in postmenopausal women the intake of 
vitamin E from food is inversely associated with the risk of death from coronary 
heart disease and that such women can lower their risk without using vitamin 
supplements. By contrast, the intake of vitamins A and C was not associated with 
lower risks of dying from coronary disease."
8602359,"Several gene products are involved in co-translational insertion of 
selenocysteine by the tRNA(Sec). In addition, a stem-loop structure in the mRNAs 
coding for selenoproteins is essential to mediate the selection of the proper 
selenocysteine UGA codon. Interestingly, in eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs, this 
stem-loop structure, the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, 
resides in the 3'-untranslated region, far downstream of the UGA codon. In view 
of unravelling the underlying complex mechanism, we have attempted to detect 
RNA-binding proteins with specificity for the SECIS element. Using mobility 
shift assays, we could show that a protein, present in different types of 
mammalian cell extracts, possesses the capacity of binding the SECIS element of 
the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA. We have termed this protein 
SBP, for Secis Binding Protein. Competition experiments attested that the 
binding is highly specific and UV cross-linking indicated that the protein has 
an apparent molecular weight in the range of 60-65 kDa. Finally, some data 
suggest that the SECIS elements in the mRNAs of GPx and another selenoprotein, 
type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase, recognize the same SBP protein. This 
constitutes the first report of the existence of a 3' UTR binding protein 
possibly involved in the eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion mechanism."
8603631,"We report 7 children who received gabapentin (GBP) as adjunctive medic ation and 
subsequently developed behavioral side effects. These behavioral changes 
consisted of intensification of baseline behaviors as well as new behavioral 
problems. Behaviors that parents considered most troublesome were tantrums, 
aggression directed toward others, hyperactivity, and defiance. All behavioral 
changes were reversible and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of 
GBP. All children had baseline attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 
developmental delays."
8603911,"The localization and intracellular transport of major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class II molecules nd lysosomal hydrolases were studied in I-Cell Disease 
(ICD) B lymphoblasts, which possess a mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-independent 
targeting pathway for lysosomal enzymes. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), MHC 
class II-invariant chain complexes colocalized with the lysosomal hydrolase 
cathepsin D in buds and vesicles that lacked markers of clathrin-coated 
vesicle-mediated transport. These vesicles fused with the endocytic pathway 
leading to the formation of ""early"" MHC class II-rich compartments (MIICs). 
Similar structures were observed in the TGN of normal beta lymphoblasts although 
they were less abundant. Metabolic labeling and subcellular fractionation 
experiments indicated that newly synthesized cathepsin D and MHC class 
II-invariant chain complexes enter a non-clathrin-coated vesicular structure 
after their passage through the TGN and segregation from the secretory pathway. 
These vesicles were also devoid of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate 
(Man-6-P) receptor, a marker of early and late endosomes. These findings suggest 
that in ICD B lymphoblasts the majority of MHC class II molecules are 
transported directly from the TGN to ""early"" MIICs and that acid hydrolases cam 
be incorporated into MIICs simultaneously by a Man-6-P-independant process."
8604012,"Eosinophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such 
as allergic asthma. Eosinophil migration in vitro can be divided into directed 
migration, or chemotaxis, and random migration, or chemokinesis. Here, we 
studied intracellular signals involved in eosinophil migration in vitro induced 
by platelet-activating factor (PAF) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), applying a Boyden 
chamber assay. Migration induced by PAF (10(-11)-10(-6) M) largely consisted of 
chemotaxis with some chemokinesis, whereas IL-5 (10(-12)-10(-8) M) induced 
chemokinesis only. Eosinophils were depleted from intracellular and 
extracellular Ca2+ to study the role of Ca2+ as a second messenger. Ca2+ 
depletion did not change PAF-induced chemotaxis, however, IL-5-induced 
chemokinesis was inhibited. Interestingly, PAF, but not IL-5, induced changes in 
[Ca2+]i. This rise originated mainly from internal stores. Inhibition of protein 
kinase A by H-89 and protein kinase C by GF 109203X had no effect on both forms 
of eosinophil migration. Addition of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine 
significantly inhibited IL-5-induced chemokinesis. Inhibition of tyrosine 
kinases by herbimycin A completely blocked IL-5-induced chemokinesis. PAF and 
IL-5-induced actin polymerization was studied to compare migratory responses 
with a migration-associated intracellular response. Ca2+ depletion significantly 
enhanced PAF-induced (10(-8) M) actin polymerization, whereas IL-5-induced actin 
polymerization was not influenced. Addition of staurosporine led to an increase 
in F-actin. Subsequent addition of PAF or IL-5 resulted in an additive increase 
in F-actin content. In summary, both forms of eosinophil migration are protein 
kinase A and protein kinase C independent. In contrast to PAF-induced 
chemotaxis, Il-5-induced chemokinesis was found to be completely Ca2+ and 
tyrosine kinase dependent."

extraocular muscle, in a 6-year-old boy.
METHODS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to confirm 
an accessory, fusiform, well-defined, solid structure in the retrobulbar space.
RESULTS: A supernumerary intraconal muscle was detected between the annulus of

CONCLUSION: This rare anomaly may represent an atavistic retractor bulbi muscle."
8605641,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are heterogeneous diseases with 
common clinical features of muscle and/or the central nervous system. Although 
molecular and histological diagnoses have been established, imaging modalities 
for the functioning evaluation of these patients are still obscure. In this 
study, we tried to use 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT images to analyze various 
mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.
METHODS: We examined 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT studies of 15 patients with various 
types of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (3 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy 
(LHON), 4 Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), 4 mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, 
lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), 3 myoclonic epilepsy and 
ragged-red fiber disease (MERRF), and 1 Leigh syndrome), diagnosed by molecular 
studies.
RESULTS: The results of our studies show obviously decreased radiotracer 
accumulation in the parieto-temporal regions after stroke-like episodes in 
patients with MELAS and MERRF: Relatively diminished brain perfusion in patients 
with KSS is noted, probably secondary to severe encephalomyopathy or subdural 
effusion. However, there seems to be no significant correlation between the 
clinical manifestations and the imaging findings in LHON and Leigh.
CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT is useful in the diagnosing and assessment 
of the progress of MERRF, MELAS and KSS. However, its role in LHON and Leigh 
syndrome seems to be debatable."
8605789,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, usefulness, safety, and dosages of 
flumazenil required when flumazenil is used in the diagnosis of 
benzodiazepine-induced coma (vs. other drug-induced coma), and to reverse or 
prevent the recurrence of unconsciousness.
DESIGN: A two-phase study: a controlled, randomized, double-blind study followed 
by a prospective, open study.
SETTING: An 800-bed, teaching, university-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS: Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, 
graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with 
flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The first 31 
patients were studied in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients 
were given flumazenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patients 
received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and 
synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was 
deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were 
indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, 
electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were 
continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either 
intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the 
patients were given flumazenil until either regaining consciousness or a maximum 
of 2.5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind 
patients or those patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later 
treated in the open phase of the study. Treatment continued by boluses or 
infusion as long as efficacious.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated 
patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients 
(p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled 
patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after 
the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high 
benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients 
did not regain consciousness. These patients had very high serum concentrations 
of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily 
ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil 
administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central 
nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to 
benzodiazepines. Seventy-one percent of the patients had ingested tricyclic 
antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders were continually and 
efficaciously treated for < or = 8 days. Fourteen (25%) of the intubated 
patients were extubated safely while 12 patients, who had shown increased 
respiratory insufficiency, resumed satisfactory respiration after flumazenil 
injection. Five cases of transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate 
were encountered. There were 27 mildly unpleasant ""waking"" episodes, such as 
anxiety, restlessness, and aggression, but no patient had benzodiazepine 
withdrawal signs, convulsions, or dysrhythmia, most noticeably absent in 
tricyclic antidepressant-intoxicated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is a valid diagnostic tool for distinguishing pure 
benzodiazepine from mixed-drug intoxication or nondrug-induced coma. Flumazenil 
is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. 
Respiratory insufficiency is reversed after its administration. Flumazenil is 
safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed 
overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants."
8606626,"The chromosome-16 and the X-chromosome forms of alpha-thalassemia--ATR-16 and 
ATR-X--exemplify 2 important causes of syndromal mental retardation. ATR-16 is a 
contiguous gene syndrome which arises from loss of DNA from the tip of 
chromosome 16p13.3 by truncation, interstitial deletion, or unbalanced 
translocation. It provided the first example of a chromosome translocation that 
could be detected by molecular analysis but not conventional cytogenetics. It 
also provided the first example of a telomeric truncation giving rise to a 
complex genetic syndrome. In contrast ATR-X appears to be due to mutations in a 
trans-acting factor that regulates gene expression. Mutations in transcription 
factors have recently been identified in a number of genetic diseases (for 
example, Denys-Drash syndrome, WT1 [19]; pituitary dwarfism, PIT1 [16]; 
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, CBP [20]. Not only is this mechanism proving to be an 
important cause of complex syndromes but it is providing new perspectives on 
certain developmental pathways. XH2 may not be a classical transcription factor 
but it is certainly involved in the regulation of gene expression, exerting its 
effects on several different genes. It seems likely that other mutations in this 
class of regulatory proteins will be found in patients with complex disorders 
including mental retardation. In broader terms the 2 mechanisms described here 
may prove to be responsible for a significant proportion of mental retardation. 
However, without a feature such as alpha-thalassemia to pinpoint the area of 
genome or pathways involved it may prove difficult to identify other, similarly 
affected genes underlying other forms of mental retardation. As the human genome 
project and rapid genome analysis evolve this problem should become less of an 
obstacle. In the meantime, it is very worthwhile to continue looking for unusual 
clinical associations that may point to critical genes underlying human genetic 
disorders."
8607977,"Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors activate MAP kinase by a complex 
mechanism involving the SH2/3 protein Grb2, the exchange protein Sos, and Ras. 
The GTP-bound Ras protein binds to the Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase 
cascade that leads to MAP kinase activation. Three MAP kinase kinase kinases 
have been described--c-Raf, c-Mos, and Mekk--that phosphorylate and activate 
Mek, the MAP kinase kinase. Activated Mek phosphorylates and activates MAP 
kinase. Subsequently, the activated MAP kinase translocates into the nucleus 
where many of the physiological targets of the MAP kinase signal transduction 
pathway are located. These substrates include transcription factors that are 
regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation (e.g., Elk-1, c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and 
C/EBP beta). Thus the MAP kinase pathway represents a significant mechanism of 
signal transduction by growth factor receptors from the cell surface to the 
nucleus that results in the regulation of gene expression. Three MAP kinase 
homologs have been identified in the rat: Erk1, Erk2, and Erk3. Human MAP 
kinases that are similar to the rat Erk kinases have also been identified by 
molecular cloning. The human Erk1 protein kinase has been shown to be widely 
expressed as a 44-kDa protein in many tissues. The human Erk2 protein kinase is 
a 41-kDa protein that is expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, a human 
Erk3-related protein kinase has been found to be expressed at a high level only 
in heart muscle and brain. The loci of these MAP kinase genes are widely 
distributed within the human genome: erk2 at 22q11.2; erk1 at 16p11.2; and 
ek3-related at 18q12-21. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five MAP kinase 
gene homologs have been described: smkl, mpk1, hog1, fus3, and kss1. Together, 
these kinases are a more diverse group than the human erks that have been 
identified. Thus the erks are likely to represent only one subgroup of a larger 
human MAP kinase gene family. A candidate for this extended family of MAP 
kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and 
phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and 
Ser-73. Evidence is presented here to demonstrate that Jnk is a distant relative 
of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Tyr and 
Thr."
8608668,"Restenosis following angioplasty is an iatrogenic disease of increasing 
frequency. Restenosis may be defined in terms of either angiographic or clinical 
criteria. Definitions of angiographic restenosis have varied in different 
studies, accounting in part for the differences in reported restenosis rates. 
Most studies now define angiographic restenosis as either a > 50% loss of 
initial gain or an absolute lesion stenosis of > or = 50% at follow-up 
angiogram. Common clinical end points used in defining restenosis include 
recurrent angina, need for repeat revascularization, or myocardial infarction. 
Despite technical advances and multiple pharmacologic interventions, most 
studies have found that the incidence of angiographic restenosis remains in the 
range of 40%; in none of these studies, however, was complete angiographic 
follow-up obtained, and thus actual restenosis rates may be somewhat higher. In 
several studies, clinical restenosis has been found to occur in approximately 
36-40% of patients. Thus, a minority of patients with angiographic restenosis 
have no clinical manifestations. Most patients who develop symptoms of 
restenosis develop these symptoms within the first 3 months after angioplasty. 
The presenting symptom in the majority of these patients is progressive 
exertional angina. Patients occasionally will present with unstable angina and 
only rarely with acute myocardial infarction. In patients who present with 
recurrent chest pain, several features have been found to be helpful in 
predicting whether they will have angiographic restenosis at follow-up 
angiography. Patients who present 1-6 months after angioplasty with typical 
anginal symptoms have a high likelihood of having angiographic restenosis. By 
contrast, patients who present more than 6 months after percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty with recurrent chest pain are more likely to 
have new, significant coronary lesions to account for their symptoms. 
Noninvasive testing in patients with clinical presentations suggestive of 
restenosis can, in general, add only modest information in predicting whether 
restenosis is indeed present. A negative exercise thallium test appears to have 
a high specificity in ruling out restenosis and may be helpful in patients who 
present with more atypical symptoms. Repeat angioplasty is the therapy most 
frequently utilized to treat restenosis, although coronary artery bypass surgery 
or medical therapy may be reasonable alternative therapies. Clinical success 
rates with repeat angioplasty are > 90%, and major complications are rare; 
however, restenosis will recur in a significant percentage of these patients. 
Some patients who develop such recurrent restenoses will ultimately benefit from 
a strategy of repeat angioplasties, although many will require surgical 
revascularization."
8608779,"Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid malignancy after 
PTC. There are marked geographical variations in the relative proportions of FTC 
and PTC, most likely related to dietary iodine content. In iodine-deficient 
areas, the relative rate of FTC tends to be increased. Other risk factors for 
FTC include age over 50 years and female sex. Genetic factors may also have a 
role in determining disease susceptibility but remain ill-defined. 
Histologically, FTC is characterized by follicle formation and the absence of 
any papillary elements in the tumor. Differential diagnosis from a benign 
adenoma can be difficult. The degree of vascular invasiveness seems to correlate 
with tumor aggressiveness, and two histologic subtypes, oxyphilic FTC and 
insular FTC, may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Primary 
treatment for FTC is complete surgical tumor removal. Extensive bilateral 
surgery beyond this goal may not confer additional benefit but can facilitate 
adjuvant treatment and follow-up. Postoperative levothyroxine treatment is 
almost universally used, and patients deemed at high risk of recurrence may 
benefit from radioiodine remnant ablation. Treatment of metastatic disease 
involves operation, radioiodine, and, in selected cases, external beam radiation 
and chemotherapy. Prognosis for patients with metastatic disease is guarded, but 
most other patients have good outcomes comparable to that in PTC. For 
nonoxyphilic FTC, high-risk features other than initial metastases include 
advanced age, locally extensive disease, and the presence of marked 
angioinvasion. In oxyphilic FTC, DNA aneuploidy is also important. Follow-up 
should be most intense during the first 5 years after primary treatment and 
needs to be tailored to the patient's risk of disease progression. For patients 
at low risk of recurrence (young, small lesions, minimally invasive tumor), 
serum thyroglobulin measurements may largely suffice, whereas higher risk 
patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and patients with significant 
titers of interfering anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies may also need to undergo 
periodic diagnostic radioiodine scanning."

8650957,"Clinical as well as basic research in the field of atherogenesis indicates that 
the progression of this disease process can be slowed down or even reversed. It 
is well established that nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and 
treatment of the classical atherogenic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes 
mellitus and hyperlipidemia. In addition, some nutrients such as the 
polyunsaturated n-3-fatty-acids or antioxidative vitamins can intervene directly 
by influencing one or more steps of the atherogenetic and/or thrombogenetic 
process. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease as 
well as of the mechanisms of nutrient action are essential to the planning of 
successful nutritional prevention strategies. Because most nutrients influence 
mainly the slow and long-standing development of the atherosclerotic lesion, 
their inclusion in primary nutritional prevention should be started at an early 
age. Few nutrients such as the n-3 fatty acids, which also reduce the 
thrombogenetic risk factors, have demonstrated some success in the secondary 
prevention of CHD. Given the complexity with which nutrients intervene in the 
atherosclerotic process and their interactions with each other, nutritional 
prevention strategies should be based on well-grounded dietary modifications 
rather than supplementation with individual nutrients."

OCA and the normal twin appeared brown versus black, respectively. Melanocytes 
from both the patient with OCA and the normal twin demonstrated equal amounts of 
NP-40-soluble melanin; however, melanocytes from the patient with OCA contained 
only 7% of the amount of insoluble melanin found from the normal twin. 
Tyrosinase- related protein-1 (TRP-1) was not detected in the OCA melanocytes by 
use of various anti-TRP-1 probes. Furthermore, transcripts for TRP-1 were absent 
in cultured OCA melanocytes. The affected twin was homozygous for a single-bp 
deletion in exon 6, removing an A in codon 368 and leading to a premature stop 
at codon 384. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity of the OCA melanocytes was 
comparable to controls when assayed in cell lysates but was only 30% of controls 
when assayed in intact cells. We conclude that this mutation of the human TRP-1 
gene affects its interaction with tyrosinase, resulting in dysregulation of 
tyrosinase activity, promotes the synthesis of brown versus black melanin, and 
is responsible for a third genetic type of OCA in humans, which we classify as 
""OCA3."""
8652136,"An Anabaena group I intron was circularly permuted at loop 5, loop 6 and loop 8, 
and tested for self-splicing activity. Precursor RNAs from these constructs 
spliced efficiently and produced circular exons in vitro. Using group I 
permuted-intron-exon sequences, circular forms of the HDV ribozyme, the RNA 
component of RNaseP from B. subtilis, the HIV TAR and a short HIV Rev-binding 
element were generated and tested for activity and stability. The activity of 
circular ribozymes is comparable to the linear counterparts with similar core 
sequences. Circular forms of the TAR and Rev-binding element showed specific 
binding to Tfr-38 and Rev(35-50) peptide, respectively. To explore the potential 
for using this methodology to express circular RNA in vivo, circular forms of 
the HDV ribozyme and RNaseP RNA were produced in E. coli. Analysis of total RNA 
indicated that the precursor RNA spliced efficiently and accurately to produce 
circular ribozymes. The activity of in vivo expressed circular ribozymes could 
be demonstrated indicating that they fold into active conformation. These 
results suggest that self-splicing group I PIE sequences could prove useful for 
expressing small stable circular ribozyme/decoy-competitor or antisense RNAs in 
cells."
8655146,"Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a 
demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a 
submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that 
contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22. Clinical features of CMT1A include 
progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait 
abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic 
phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). 
Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed 
to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare 
cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in 
two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with 
17p partial trisomy. Our findings show that the CMT1A phenotype of reduced NCV 
is specifically associated with PMP22 gene duplications, thus providing further 
support for the PMP22 gene dosage mechanism for CMT1A."
8656260,"PURPOSE: Based on preclinical and clinical studies that suggested amifostine may 
potentiate the effects of cytotoxic drugs, we conducted a phase II trial of 
amifostine, cisplatin, and vinblastine (ACV) in patients with metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with metastatic NSCLC received 
amifostine (740 or 910 mg/m2) before 120 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 1, plus 
weekly 5 mg/m2 of vinblastine without amifostine. Cycles were repeated every 4 
weeks. Patients were required to have good performance status, no prior 
chemotherapy or biologic therapy, adequate organ function, and measurable 
disease.
RESULTS: Sixteen of 25 assessable patients had an objective response documented 
by computed tomographic (CT) scan (64%; 95% confidence interval, 45% to 85%). 
With a median duration of follow-up of 19.2 months, the estimated median 
survival is 17 months and 1-year survival is 64% (+/- 10%). Toxicities included 
grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (8% and 92%, respectively) and nausea and vomiting 
(32% and 4%, respectively). Reversible grade 3 nephrotoxicity occurred in 12% of 
patients, although only one of 13 patients (7%) who received > or = four cycles 
of therapy had > or = 40% reduction in creatinine clearance. Grade 3 neuropathy 
was observed in seven patients at cumulative cisplatin doses that ranged from 
324 to 660 mg/m2; grade 3 ototoxicity occurred in three patients at cumulative 
cisplatin doses that ranged from 390 to 450 mg/m2. Four patients (16%) required 
early stopping of an amifostine infusion due to hypotension.
CONCLUSION: ACV appears to be a highly active regimen in metastatic NSCLC. Acute 
toxicities were generally reversible and the data suggest that amifostine may 
protect against long-term renal insufficiency from cumulative doses of 
cisplatin. Although the sample size of this trial is small, the results are 
significantly encouraging to warrant confirmation in randomized 
multiinstitutional trials."
8656667,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a 
t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL 
gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase 
activity and transforming abilities. The t(9;22) was suggested to be associated 
with genomic imprinting of centromeric regions of chromosomes 9 and 22, but the 
genes directly affected by the translocation, ABL and BCR, were shown not to be 
imprinted. For most diagnostic and research purposes the BCR-ABL gene can be 
efficiently identified by reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction 
(RT/PCR) amplification of its fusion transcripts, which can be quantified by 
competitive PCR and similar assays for assessment of residual disease in the 
follow-up of therapy. In the great majority of CML patients the BCR-ABL 
transcripts exhibit a b2a2 and/or a b3a2 junction; in rare cases, the only 
detectable BCR-ABL transcripts have unusual junctions, such as b2a3, b3a3, e1a2 
or e6a2. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 
'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in 
leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL 
transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic 
progenitors from some CML patients. The role, if any, of the reciprocal ABL-BCR 
hybrid gene in CML is unknown. Although its mRNA message is in frame, no ABL-BCR 
fusion protein has yet been identified in CML patients. The blast crisis of CML 
has been variably associated with abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, such as RAS 
and MYC, or of tumour suppressor genes, in particular RB, p53 and p16, or with 
the generation of chimeric transcription factors, as in the AML1-EVI1 gene 
fusion. It is likely, therefore, that multiple and alternative molecular 
defects, as opposed to a single universal mechanism, underlie the acute 
transformation of the disease."
8657465,"The differentiation between physiological bowlegs and infantile Blount's disease 
in patients aged 11-30 months is very difficult. Nevertheless, diagnosis is 
deemed important because treatment of infantile Blount's disease is recommended. 
Fourteen patients with severe bowing of the legs seen in our outpatient clinic 
were investigated retrospectively. We examined them and measured the 
tibiofemoral and metaphyseal/diaphyseal angles in radiographs taken at their 
first presentation. The finding that the tibiofemoral angle is not helpful in 
differential diagnosis could be confirmed but, contrary to reports by other 
authors, neither was the metaphyseal/diaphyseal angle. In view of the 
spontaneous recovery of all investigated patients, it must be doubted whether a 
diagnosis of infantile tibia vara can be made in early infancy, and whether 
infantile Blount's disease is a diagnosis in its own right."
8659523,"Most Robertsonian translocations are dicentric, suggesting that the location of 
chromosomal breaks leading to their formation occur in the acrocentric short 
arm. Previous cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic studies have shown that few 
Robertsonian translocations retain ribosomal genes or beta-satellite DNA. 
Breakpoints in satellite III DNA, specifically between two chromosome 
14-specific subfamilies, pTRS-47 and pTRS-63, have been indicated for most of 
the dicentric 14q21q and 13q14q translocations that have been studied. We have 
analyzed the structure of 36 dicentric translocations, using several repetitive 
DNA probes that localize to the acrocentric short arm. The majority of the 
translocations retained satellite III DNA, while others proved variable in 
structure. Of 10 14q21q translocations analyzed, satellite III DNA was 
undetected in 1; 6 retained one satellite III DNA subfamily, pTRS-47; and 3 
appeared to contain two 14-specific satellite III DNA sub-families, pTRS-47 and 
pTRS-63. In 10/11 translocations involving chromosome 15, the presence of 
satellite III DNA was observed. Our results show that various regions of the 
acrocentric short arm, and, particularly, satellite III DNA sequences, are 
involved in the formation of Robertsonian translocations."
8662546,"Proper regulation of chondrocyte differentiation is necessary for the 
morphogenesis of skeletal elements, yet little is known about the molecular 
regulation of this process. A chicken homolog of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member 
of the conserved Hedgehog family of secreted proteins that is expressed during 
bone formation, has now been isolated. Ihh has biological properties similar to 
those of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), including the ability to regulate the conserved 
targets Patched (Ptc) and Gli. Ihh is expressed in the prehypertrophic 
chondrocytes of cartilage elements, where it regulates the rate of hypertrophic 
differentiation. Misexpression of Ihh prevents proliferating chondrocytes from 
initiating the hypertrophic differentiation process. The direct target of Ihh 
signaling is the perichondrium, where Gli and Ptc flank the expression domain of 
Ihh. Ihh induces the expression of a second signal, parathyroid hormone-related 
protein (PTHrP), in the periarticular perichondrium. Analysis of PTHrP (-/-) 
mutant mice indicated that the PTHrP protein signals to its receptor in the 
prehypertrophic chondrocytes, thereby blocking hypertrophic differentiation. In 
vitro application of Hedgehog or PTHrP protein to normal or PTHrP (-/-) limb 
explants demonstrated that PTHrP mediates the effects of Ihh through the 
formation of a negative feedback loop that modulates the rate of chondrocyte 
differentiation."
8662983,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in the state of insulin 
resistance associated with obesity. It has previously been shown that one 
important mechanism by which TNF-alpha interferes with insulin signaling is 
through the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), 
which can then function as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the 
insulin receptor (IR). However, the receptors and the signaling pathway used by 
TNF-alpha that mediate the inhibition of IR activity are unknown. We show here 
that human TNF-alpha, which binds only to the murine p55 TNF receptor (TNFR), is 
as effective at inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and 
IRS-1 in adipocytes and myeloid 32D cells as murine TNF-alpha, which binds to 
both p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR. Likewise, antibodies that are specific agonists for 
p55 TNFR or p75 TNFR demonstrate that stimulation of p55 TNFR is sufficient to 
inhibit insulin signaling, though a small effect can also be seen with 
antibodies to p75 TNFR. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and ceramides, known to be 
formed by activation of p55 TNFR, inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation 
and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Myeloid 32D 
cells expressing IR and IRS-1 are sensitive to this inhibition, but cells 
expressing IR and IRS-2 are resistant, pointing to an important difference in 
the biological function between IRS-1 and IRS-2. These data strongly suggest 
that TNF-alpha inhibits insulin signaling via stimulation of p55 TNFR and 
sphingomyelinase activity, which results in the production of an inhibitory form 
of IRS-1."
8663170,"Thyroxine dynamically regulates levels of type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase 
(5'D-II) by modulating enzyme inactivation and targeting the enzyme to different 
pathways of internalization. 5'D-II is an approximately 200-kDa multimeric 
protein containing a 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit (p29) and an unknown 
number of other subunits. In the absence of thyroxine (T4), p29 is slowly 
endocytosed and transported to the lysosomes. T4 treatment rapidly activates an 
actin-mediated endocytotic pathway and targets the enzyme to the endosomes. In 
this study, we have characterized the influence of T4 on the intracellular 
trafficking of 5'D-II. We show that T4 accelerates the rate of 5'D-II 
inactivation by translocating the enzyme to the interior of the cell and by 
sequestering p29 in the endosomal pool without accelerating the rate of 
degradation of p29. This dichotomy between the rapid inactivation of catalytic 
activity and the much slower degradation of p29 is consistent with the reuse of 
p29 in the production of 5'D-II activity. Immunocytochemical analysis with a 
specific anti-p29 IgG shows that pulse affinity-labeled p29 reappears on the 
plasma membrane approximately 2 h after enzyme internalization in the presence 
of T4, indicating that p29 is recycled. Despite the ability of p29 to be 
recycled in the T4-treated cell, 5'D-II catalytic activity requires ongoing 
protein synthesis, presumably of another enzyme component(s) or an accessory 
enzyme-related protein. In the absence of T4, enzyme inactivation and p29 
degradation are temporally linked, and pulse affinity-labeled p29 is 
internalized and sequestered in discrete intracellular pools. These data suggest 
that T4 regulates fundamental processes involved with the turnover of integral 
membrane proteins and participates in regulating the inter-relationships between 
the degradation, recycling, and synthetic pathways."
8663349,"At the nuclear envelope in higher eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina and the 
heterochromatin are adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane, and their attachment

of the inner nuclear membrane, associated with two human polypeptides homologous 
to Drosophila HP1, a heterochromatin protein involved in position-effect 
variegation. LBR fusion proteins bound to HP1 proteins synthesized by in vitro 
translation and present in cell lysates. Antibodies against LBR also 
co-immunoprecipitated HP1 proteins from cell extracts. LBR can interact with 
chromodomain proteins that are highly conserved in eukaryotic species and may 
function in the attachment of heterochromatin to the inner nuclear membrane in 
cells."
8664565,"The research work presented at this the 2nd Workshop of the International 
Consortium on X-linked Myotubular Myopathy has clearly shown the benefits to be 
gained from a multinational research consortium with a common interest in 
identifying and cloning the MTM1 gene. The clinicians have rapid access to 
knowledge about the current state of the detailed physical map encompassing the 
disease gene, which is of particular importance when asked to carry out a 
linkage-based carrier risk assessment in such families, and the molecular 
geneticists benefit by having access to a large panel of samples from clinically 
well-documented XMTM patients, and their families, for the rapid testing of any 
new potential candidate genes. Strategies for the rapid exchange of information 
and material between members of the consortium to facilitate the cloning of the 
MTM gene were generated in the hope that the next Workshop will see the 
consortium discussing the clinical and histological implications of the 
mutations found. To this end it was decided to set up a Register, based in 
Cardiff, of all XMTM patients from whom tissue and DNA samples had been made 
available to the consortium. A decision was also made to collect samples from 
the very rare families with possible autosomal MTM for future study."
8666325,"Although liver test abnormalities are frequently identified in patients with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the causes, evaluation, and outcome 
of jaundice in these patients have not been systematically evaluated. From 
August 1, 1990 through September 1, 1994, all human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected patients with liver test abnormalities seen by the 
gastroenterology service at a large, inner-city hospital were prospectively 
identified. Jaundice was defined as a serum bilirubin concentration > or = 3 
mg/dL. The etiology of jaundice was determined by the pattern of liver 
biochemistry test abnormalities, radiographic studies, liver biopsy, clinical 
follow-up, and autopsy. During the study period, 541 HIV-infected patients (511 
with AIDS) were evaluated for liver disease by our service; 36 of these patients 
had jaundice (7 percent). The most common causes of jaundice were drug-induced 
hepatitis, occurring in 11 patients (31 percent), and alcoholic liver disease, 
occurring in 5 (13 percent). Opportunistic infections or neoplasms were 
identified as the cause of jaundice in 11 patients (30 percent), with 4 having 
intrahepatic disease and 7 having extrahepatic disease. Multiple potential 
causes were seen in 3 patients. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed 
tomography (CT) were helpful in suggesting the underlying cause of disease. The 
short-term mortality was high, with 9 patients dying during the hospitalization 
(25 percent) and 7 patients dying within 6 months of evaluation. Liver disease 
was the cause of death in 7 of these patients. In conclusion, jaundice is 
uncommon in AIDS and may result from a variety of both opportunistic and 
non-opportunistic etiologies. Drug-induced hepatitis is the most common cause 
and may be fatal. Long-term survival was poor."
8667563,"OBJECTIVE: To develop clinical, demographic, and pathological profiles of young 
competitive athletes who died suddenly.
DESIGN: Systematic evaluation of clinical information and circumstances 
associated with sudden deaths; interviews with family members, witnesses, and 
coaches; and analyses of postmortem anatomic, microscopic, and toxicologic data.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 158 sudden deaths that occurred in trained 
athletes throughout the United States from 1985 through 1995 were analyzed. MAIN 
OUTCOME MEASURES--Characteristics and probable cause of death.
RESULTS: Of 158 sudden deaths among athletes, 24 (15%) were explained by 
noncardiovascular causes. Among the 134 athletes who had cardiovascular causes 
of sudden death, the median age was 17 years (range, 12-40 years), 120 (90%) 
were male, 70 (52%) were white, and 59 (44%) were black. The most common 
competitive sports involved were basketball (47 cases) and football (45 cases), 
together accounting for 68% of sudden deaths. A total of 121 athletes (90%) 
collapsed during or immediately after a training session (78 cases) or a formal 
athletic contest (43 cases), with 80 deaths (63%) occurring between 3 PM and 9 
PM. The most common structural cardiovascular diseases identified at autopsy as 
the primary cause of death were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (48 athletes [36%]), 
which was disproportionately prevalent in black athletes compared with white 
athletes (48% vs 26% of deaths; P = .01), and malformations involving anomalous 
coronary artery origin (17 athletes [13%]). Of 115 athletes who had a standard 
preparticipation medical evaluation, only 4 (3%) were suspected of having 
cardiovascular disease, and the cardiovascular abnormality responsible for 
sudden death was correctly identified in only 1 athlete (0.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Sudden death in young competitive athletes usually is precipitated 
by physical activity and may be due to a heterogeneous spectrum of 
cardiovascular disease, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Preparticipation screening appeared to be of limited value in identification of 
underlying cardiovascular abnormalities."
8670277,"BMP-3b (also termed GDF-10) is a novel BMP-3 related protein recently discovered 
in rat femur tissue by molecular cloning. In this paper, we have isolated cDNA 
and the gene for human BMP-3b and determined their structure. Cloned human 
BMP-3b cDNA with a size of 2632 base pairs encodes a 478 amino acid precursor 
protein sharing 83% identity with rat BMP-3b. The human BMP-3b gene is composed 
of 3 exons and spans approximately 13 kilobases of DNA. The 5' flanking region 
carries no typical TATA box but G+C rich sequences. Southern blot analysis 
revealed that the BMP-3b gene is situated in a single locus of chromosome 10. By 
Northern analysis, human BMP-3b transcripts were detected primarily in femur,

8670839,"Iron deprivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces transcription of genes 
required for high-affinity iron uptake. AFT1 mediates this transcriptional 
control. In this report, the 5'-flanking region of FET3, which encodes a 
copper-dependent oxidase required for iron transport, was analyzed and found to 
contain a DNA sequence responsible for AFT1-regulated gene expression. AFT1 was 
capable of interacting specifically with this DNA sequence. A core element 
within this DNA sequence necessary for the binding of AFT1 was also determined. 
In vivo footprinting demonstrated occupancy of the AFT1 binding site in cells 
deprived of iron and not in cells grown in the presence of iron. Thus, the 
environmental signal resulting from iron deprivation was transduced through the 
regulated binding of AFT1 to the FET3 promoter, followed by the activation of 
transcription. A regulon of genes under the control of AFT1 could be defined. 
AFT1 was able to bind to a consensus binding site (PyPuCACCCPu) in the 5' region 
of FRE1, FRE2, FTR1, FTH1 and CCC2."
8672259,"The photocytotoxicity characteristics of aluminium phthalocyanine chloride 
(AIPc), aluminium phthalocyanine disulphonate (AlS2Pc), aluminium phthalocyanine 
tetrasulphonate (AlS4PC) and haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) were compared 
using primary cultures of human meningioma cells. Cells were preincubated with 
the photosensitising agent for 16 h, then illuminated for 15 min with broad band 
red light (5 OW/cm2). The resultant cytotoxicity was assessed by tetrazolium 
(MTT) reduction 24 h later. AlPc was found to be 400, 10,000 and 250 times more 
potent that AlS2Pc, AlS4Pc and HpD, respectively, as an in vitro 
photosensitizing agent for meningioma cells. The subcellular localisation of 
AlPc, AlS2Pc, AlS4Pc and HpD in meningioma cells was determined by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy. None of the agents localized to the nucleus. The 
distribution of ALPc was quite diffuse through the cytoplasm. In contrast, 
AlS2Pc and AlS4Pc were localized vesicles suggestive of lysosomes, and HpD in 
membranous organelles distinct from mitochondria. AlPc and HpD were tested with 
five different meningioma samples and provided a range of IC50 values from 0.009 
to 0.022 OM and from 3.5 to 6.5 OM, respectively. When the MTT assay with AlPc 
was performed 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after illumination, the mean IC50 values were 
0.25, 0.037, 0.019 and 0.012 OM, respectively, indicating that the cytotoxic 
effect continued to increase up to 72 h. Cells were incubated with AlPc and HpD 
for different times up to 24 h before exposure to light. AlPc cytotoxicity was 
half-maximal with an incubation time of 8 h, whereas HpD cytotoxicity was 
half-maximal with an incubation time of 2 h, implying slower uptake kinetics for 
AlPc than for HpD. These data indicate unique features of AlPc which suggests 
its application as a potent, non-toxic photosensitizer in the photodynamic 
therapy of human meningiomas."
8672833,"OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanisms and clinical significance of adverse 
interactions between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and discuss how these interactions can be avoided.
DATA SOURCES: Previous studies of interactions between warfarin and NSAIDs or 
reports of adverse interactions were identified from a MEDLINE search (1976 to 
present) and from the reference lists of pertinent articles.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were considered for inclusion 
in the review. Pertinent information was selected for discussion.
DATA SYNTHESIS: All NSAIDs can prolong bleeding time by inhibiting platelet 
function. High-dose aspirin has a direct hypoprothrombinemic effect. 
Phenylbutazone and its analogs enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of 
warfarin through a pharmacokinetic interaction by inhibiting the hepatic 
metabolism of warfarin. Mefenamic acid also enhances the anticoagulant effect of 
warfarin, but the mechanism is not known. The clinical relevance of protein 
binding displacement in the interaction between warfarin and NSAIDs has been 
overstated, although a significant one may be more likely in the presence of 
high concentrations of NSAIDs in patients with slow elimination of warfarin 
(e.g., those with severe heart failure or impaired liver function). NSAIDs can 
induce gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely to be more severe if warfarin 
is also given.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged 
because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients 
receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs, phenylbutazone and its analogs, 
high-dose aspirin, mefenamic acid, excessive use of topical methyl salicylate, 
and NSAIDs that are associated with a higher risk of bleeding peptic ulcers 
should be avoided. Patients should be closely monitored for anticoagulant 
control and bleeding complications during the combined use of warfarin and 
NSAIDs."
8673125,"The paired-class homeobox-containing gene, Cart1, is expressed in forebrain 
mesenchyme, branchial arches, limb buds and cartilages during embryogenesis. 
Here, we show that Cart1-homozygous mutant mice are born alive with acrania and 
meroanencephaly but die soon after birth-a phenotype that strikingly resembles a 
corresponding human syndrome caused by a neural tube closure defect. 
Developmental studies suggest that Cart1 is required for forebrain mesenchyme 
survival and that its absence disrupts cranial neural tube morphogenesis by 
blocking the initiation of closure in the midbrain region that ultimately leads 
to the generation of lethal craniofacial defects. Prenatal treatment of Cart1 
homozygous mutants with folic acid suppresses the development of the 
acrania/meroanencephaly phenotype."
8674142,"Adaptive immune protection of mucous membranes is provided mainly by secretory 
IgA (SIgA) antibodies. This first-line defence is accomplished through an 
ingenious cooperation between the mucosal B-cell system and the epithelial 
glycoprotein called secretory component (SC). This is quantitatively the most 
important receptor of the immune system because it is responsible for external 
transport of locally produced polymeric IgA (pIgA), which is the major humoral 
mediator substance of the whole immune system. Transmembrane SC belongs to the 
Ig supergene family and functions as a general pIg receptor, also translocating 
pentameric IgM externally to form secretory IgM. The B-cells responsible for 
local pIg production are initially stimulated in lymphoepithelial structures, 
particularly the Peyer's patches in the distal small intestine, from which they 
migrate as memory cells to exocrine tissues all over the body. Mucous membranes 
are thus furnished with secretory antibodies in an integrated way, ensuring a 
variety of specificities at every secretory site. There is currently great 
interest in exploiting this integrated or ""common' mucosal immune system for 
oral vaccination against pathogenic infectious agents and also to induce 
therapeutic peripheral tolerance to ameliorate T-cell-mediated autoimmune 
diseases. Much remains to be learnt about antigen uptake and processing 
necessary to elicit stimulatory or suppressive mucosal immune responses, and how 
normal homeostasis is maintained in the intestinal mucosa. Considerable 
information has accumulated about various types of immune deviation that may 
lead to local or extraintestinal hypersensitivity reactions against luminal 
antigen, but the crucial mechanisms remain obscure."
8674419,"The molecular determinants that direct gene expression to the ventricles of the 
heart are for the most part unknown. Additionally, little data is available on 
how the anterior/posterior axis of the heart tube is determined and whether the 
left and right atrial and ventricular chambers are assigned as part of this 
process. Utilizing myosin light chain-2 ventricular promoter/beta-galactosidase 
reporter transgenes, we have determined the minimal cis-acting sequences 
required for ventricular-specific gene expression. In multiple independent 
transgenic mouse lines, we found that both a 250 base pair myosin light chain-2 
ventricular promoter fragment, as well as a dimerized 28 bp sub-element (HF-1) 
containing binding sites for HF1a and HF1b/MEF2 factors, directed 
ventricular-specific reporter expression from as early as the endogenous gene, 
at day 7.5-8.0 post coitum. While the endogenous gene is expressed uniformly 
throughout both ventricles, the transgenes were expressed in a right 
ventricular/conotruncal dominant fashion, suggesting that they contain only a 
subset of the elements which respond to positional information in the developing 
heart tube. Expression of the transgene was cell autonomous and its 
temporospatial characteristics not affected by mouse strain/methylation state of 
the genome. To determine whether ventricular-specific expression of the 
transgene was dependent upon regulatory genes required for correct ventricular 
differentiation, the 250 base pair transgene was bred into both retinoid X 
receptoralpha and Nkx2-5 null backgrounds. The transgene was expressed in both 
mutant backgrounds, despite the absence of endogenous myosin light chain-2 
ventricular transcript in Nkx2-5 null embryos. Ventricular specification, as 
judged by transgene expression, appeared to occur normally in both mutants. 
Thus, the HF-1 element, directs chamber-specific transcription of a transgene 
reporter independently of retinoid X receptoralpha and Nkx2-5, and defines a 
minimal combinatorial pathway for ventricular chamber gene expression. The 
patterned expression of this transgene may provide a model system in which to 
investigate the cues that dictate anterior-posterior (right ventricle/left 
ventricle) gradients during mammalian heart development."
8676929,"The comet assay is frequently used to measure DNA damage in individual cells. In 
order to better understand the mechanisms behind the technique, we have studied 
the behaviour of DNA under different electrophoresis conditions in mammalian 
cells exposed to gamma radiation. The comet tails obtained after neutral 
electrophoresis seem to consist of DNA loops which are attached to structures in 
the nucleus, since the DNA cannot move in the second direction after 
two-dimensional electrophoresis. When the DNA is labelled by a short pulse, 
microautoradiography reveals that all label appear in the head of the comets 
when neutral electrophoresis is applied. After chase incubation, the label moves 
out into the tails. This gives further support to the view that the DNA loops 
are fixed to some structure in the nucleus where also the DNA synthesis takes 
place. Under alkaline electrophoresis conditions, however, the entire comet 
tails move in the new electrophoresis direction. Thus, it appears that the 
alkaline comet tails consist of free DNA fragments. Further, the effects of 
alkaline concentration and sodium chloride during unwinding and electrophoresis 
are discussed. Throughout the study, a protocol for drying and fixation of the 
comets has been used."
8678146,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to describe the hepatic imaging findings in 
selected patients with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and 
low platelet count) and to correlate these findings with the severity of 
concurrent clinical and laboratory abnormalities.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients with laboratory criteria for HELLP syndrome with 
complaints of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain in association with 
either shoulder pain, neck pain, or relapsing hypotension underwent imaging of 
the liver. Clinical and laboratory parameters were then correlated with the 
hepatic imaging findings.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were evaluated in this study. Computed tomographic 
scanning of the liver was used for 33 patients. Additional imaging evaluations 
included magnetic resonance imaging for 4 patients and ultrasonographic 
evaluation of the liver for 5 patients. In 15 cases (45%) the computed 
tomographic results were abnormal. The most frequent abnormal hepatic imaging 
findings were subcapsular hematoma (n = 13) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (n = 
6). There was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of 
an abnormal hepatic imaging finding and the severity of liver function test 
abnormalities. However, the severity of thrombocytopenia did correlate with 
hepatic imaging findings (p = 0.04). In particular, an abnormal hepatic imaging 
finding was noted for 10 of 13 patients (77%) with a platelet count of < or = 20 
x 10(9)/L (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in liver function test results do not accurately 
reflect the presence of abnormal hepatic imaging findings in HELLP syndrome. 
Patients with HELLP syndrome having complaints of right upper quadrant pain and 
neck pain, shoulder pain, or relapsing hypotension should undergo imaging of the 
liver."
8679252,"We have identified a new member of the transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-beta) superfamily, growth/differentiation factor-10 (GDF-10), which is 
highly related to bone morphogenetic protein-3 (BMP-3). The nucleotide sequence 
of GDF-10 encodes a predicted protein of 476 amino acids with a molecular weight 
of approximately 52,000. The GDF-10 polypeptide contains a potential signal 
sequence for secretion, a putative RXXR proteolytic processing site, and a 
carboxy-terminal domain with considerable homology to other known members of the 
TGF-beta superfamily. In the mature carboxy-terminal domain GDF-10 is more 
homologous to BMP-3 (83% amino acid sequence identity) than to any other 
previously identified TGF-beta family member. GDF-10 also shows significant 
homology to BMP-3 (approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity) in the pro- 
region of the molecule. Based on these sequence comparisons, GDF-10 and BMP-3 
define a new subgroup within the larger TGF-beta superfamily. By Northern 
analysis, GDF-10 mRNA was detected primarily in murine uterus, adipose tissue, 
and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen. In addition, GDF-10 mRNA 
was present in both neonatal and adult bone samples, with higher levels being 
detected in calvaria than in long bone. These results suggest that GDF10 may 
play multiple roles in regulating cell differentiation events, including those 
involved in skeletal morphogenesis. Gdf10 was mapped to the proximal region of 
mouse chromosome 14 close to a region known to contain a spontaneous recessive 
mutation that is associated with a craniofacial defect."
8681927,"In resistance training, it has been empirically accepted that muscle hypertrophy 
is developed by low intensity and high volume training, while muscle strength 
and power are developed by high intensity and low volume training. The purpose 
of the present study was to investigate the influence of two different modes of 
resistance training on isokinetic strength and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) 
in females. Eleven females, who had no experience in resistance training, 
participated in this study and were randomly divided into two groups. The former 
consisted of 4-5 sets of 15-20 RM (repetition maximum) with sufficient rest 
between sets (Group H), while the latter consisted of 8-9 sets of 4-6R M with 90 
s of rest between sets (Group S). The former was assumed to be appropriate for 
muscle hypertrophy and the latter muscle strength, respectively. All subjects 
completed isotonic knee extension exercise three times a week for 8 weeks. 
Measurements were made on quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and 
isokinetic torques at 0, 60, 180, and approximately 300 degrees before training, 
at the fifth week and the end of training period. Muscle CSA was defined as the 
sum of CSA measured at 30, 50 and 70% of femur length. After training, muscle 
CSA had significantly increased in both groups: 3.3 +/- 0.7% (p < .05) for group 
H and 3.6 +/- 1.1% (p < .05) for group S, respectively. While the changes in 
isokinetic torque were 43.4 +/- 47.5% (p < .05) for group H and 27.4 +/- 31.3% 
(p < .05) for group S, respectively. In both groups the percentage changes of 
the isokinetic strength were significantly higher than those of the CSA. No 
significant difference in these variables were found between the two groups. 
These results suggest that during the early phase of resistance training two 
different modes of resistance training may have similar effects on muscle CSA 
and isokinetic strength in untrained females."
8682350,"Children deficient in vitamin E have various neurologic symptoms. 2 cases 
representing different mechanisms of this vitamin deficiency are reported. A 
15-year-old boy with fat malabsorption due to cystic fibrosis who was diagnosed 
as being vitamin E deficient (< 0.5 mg/l), had typical neuropathies. On the 
other hand, a 12-year-old Beduin girl had isolated vitamin E deficiency, as well 
as neurological symptoms suggestive of Friedrich's ataxia. Vitamin E 
supplementation by intramuscular injection in the first case and per os in the 
second led to significant improvement in neurological symptoms."
8683598,"The solution structure of the isolated antibody heavy chain variable domain 
(VH)-P8 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The VH had previously been modified 
(camelised) at three positions in its former antibody light chain variable 
domain (VL) interface to reduce hydrophobicity by mimicking camelid heavy chains 
naturally devoid of light chains. The architecture of two pleated beta-sheets 
and the conformation of the H1 and H2 loops in VH-P8 are very similar to those 
in non-camelised, VL-associated VH domains. Major differences concern the H3 
loop, which no longer points towards the now absent VL, and three residues in 
the former VL interface. The side-chains of Val37 and Trp103 are buried and the 
Arg38 side-chain exposed in VH-P8. In non-camelised, VL-associated VH domains 
the side-chains of Val37 and Trp103 are in contact with the VL while the Arg38 
side-chain is buried within the VH. Reorientation of Trp103 is due to the local 
structure in the beta-bulge of strand G. Reorientation of Val37 and Arg38 is 
caused by a disruption of regular beta-structure in strand C opposite the 
beta-bulge in strand C'. These changes, combined with the more hydrophilic 
side-chains of the camelised residues, reduce hydrophobicity and prevent 
non-specific binding of camelised VH domains, which proved critical for their 
use as small recognition units. The VH-P8 structure also indicates structural 
reasons for two other mutations specific for light-chain-lacking camel 
immunoglobins. Absence of the VH-typical Arg94/Asp101 salt bridge at the base of 
the H3 loop in VH-P8 may explain why a positively charged residue at position 94 
is not conserved in camels. Reorientation of Val37 suggests a function of the 
camel-specific phenylalanine residue at this position in the hydrophobic core of 
light-chain-lacking camel heavy chains."
8684695,"More than 6 million women now compete in strenous exercis, worldwide. The sports 
participation is a sage experience for the teenage athlete. But intense exercise 
had been reported to delay menarche when the sports activity was begun before 
puberty. Is has been shown to increase beta-endorphins and catecholamine in 
women. Menstrual cyclicity is influenced by prior and concomitant exercise 
intensity and/or duration in long-distance runners, gymnasts, ballet dancers, 
fencers, rowers. Altered menstrual cyclicity can approach 70% in strenuously 
exercising women. Menstrual dysfunction has been associated with significant 
weight loss, decreased body fat, previous history od menstrual dysfunction, 
stress and intensity of athletic training. A complication of amenorrhea is the 
loss of bone mineral content and bone density. Urinary incontinence during 
physical stresses is common in young nulliparous women. Some female athletes to 
increase their sports performance artificially take illegal steroid substances. 
Perineo-sphincter exercise must be started very early during the post-partum, 
before the start of sports. Most of the athletes of all ages resulted to prefer 
the oral contraceptive method."
8690305,"Effects of a novel TRH analog, montirelin hydrate (NS-3), on the coma caused by 
head concussion and narcosis induced by pentobarbital were compared with those 
of TRH in mice. Head concussion caused a behavioral comatose state with loss of 
the righting reflex and spontaneous motor activity. NS-3 shortened the latent 
periods to the recovery of the righting reflex (0.03-0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and 
spontaneous motor activity (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) following the head concussion. In 
the case of TRH, higher doses were needed to induce such effects. NS-3 (0.1-0.3 
mg/kg, i.v.) reversed the pentobarbital-induced narcosis in a dose-dependent 
manner. A similar effect was elicited by 30- to 100-fold higher doses of TRH 
than NS-3. The analeptic effect of NS-3 in the pentobarbital-narcotized mice was 
antagonized by SCH23390, a dopamine D1 antagonist or by the combined treatment 
with prazosin and scopolamine, while neither prazosin nor scopolamine alone 
antagonized the analeptic effect of NS-3. Taken together with the finding that 
NS-3 did not bind to dopamine, adrenaline or muscarine receptors, it is 
suggested that NS-3 may restore the disturbance of consciousness by activating 
the brain dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine neurons without stimulating 
these receptors directly."
8691638,"Two hundred and eleven surgically resected primary lung tumors were studied 
immunohistochemically. According to histologic type, they were 129 
adenocarcinomas, 56 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 small cell carcinomas, 8 large 
cell carcinomas, 8 adenosquamous cell carcinomas, 5 so-called carcinosarcomas 
and 2 other tumors. Immunohistochemical expression of p53 and bcl-2 was studied 
in relation to the disease-free survival. Among the 211 patients with lung 
cancer, 109 were positive for p53 expression, and there was no significant 
relationship between p53 expression and sex, or clinicopathological stage and 
size of the tumor, although the patients with squamous cell carcinoma had a 
significantly higher frequency of p53 expression than those with 
adenocarcinomas. The frequency of p53 expression was significantly higher in the 
patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas than in those with other 
histologic types. Seventy four of the 211 patients were positive for bcl-2 
expression and bcl-2 expression was higher in the stage I patients and patients 
with small lung tumors 2cm or less in diameter than in the other patients. The 
patients with adenocarcinoma had a higher frequency of expression than those 
with squamous cell carcinoma but no difference was found in the histological 
differentiation of the tumor. The 5-year survival of patients positive for p53 
expression was poorer than that of those with negative expression and the 
survival rate was higher in the patients positive for bcl-2 expression than in 
those with negative expression. These findings suggested that the expression of 
p53 and bcl-2 is a useful marker of follow-up and prognosis, but will require 
more data concerning the mechanism of carcinogenesis. Seven cases of primary 
lung cancer were examined for genetic abnormality of the p53 gene. cDNA was 
synthesized from total RNA of primary tissues of lung cancer using oligo (dT) 
primer and reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 
PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis were performed. Five 
patients gave a positive result upon PCR-SSCP analysis of the p53 gene. To 
confirm the results of PCR-SSCP analysis, their nucleotide sequences were 
further analyzed and four of them had point mutations at different codons (154, 
176, 207, 236) and one had deletion of one nucleotide (245) in exon 5 and 8. 
Fifteen percent of 26 patients with small peripheral lung adenocarcinomas less 
than 2cm in diameter were already advanced in stage and various factors such as 
vascular invasion, pleural involvement and degree of scar grade were higher than 
in patients with clinicopathological stage I. In advanced cases, the frequencies 
of p53 expression was higher than in stage I cases. Concerning the relationship 
of the degree of scar grade to PDGF-B expression, we demonstrated the production 
of PDGF-B protein immunohistochemically and the expression of PDGF-B-mRNA by In 
situ hybridization in the adenocarcinoma cells and macrophages of the lung 
tumors. However, no significant correlation was observed between the degree of 
PDGF-B expression and collagen production in the fibrotic focus."
8692272,"The viral Tax protein, which is encoded by human T-cell leukaemia virus HTLV-I, 
activates nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors and 
relieves cytoplasmic sequestration of RelA and Rel by heterodimerization with 
NF-kappa B1/p1O5 (refs 1,2). Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is 
performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to 
two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened 
with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is 
selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that 
p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No 
bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results, 
we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring 
its anchorage to the proteasome."
8697423,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used 
to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the 
classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). We applied FISH to study three 
CML patients showing variant Ph chromosome (either complex or simple type). The 
results demonstrate that the use of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-derived 
probe (D107F9) and a cosmid probe (cos-abl 8), specific for BCR and ABL genes 
respectively, allows also the detection of the BCR-ABL fusion in CML patients 
with variant Ph."
8699317,"The proto-oncogene ras is an essential gene for the growth and the 
differentiation for various types of cells. Ras, ras gene product, is a GTP 
binding protein which controls the signal transduction by GTP hydrolysis. The 
ras gene is frequently activated by point mutations in various types of human 
cancers, which results in a decrease in the GTPase activity of its product. A 
GTPase-activating protein p120 (p120GAP) was identified as a factor which 
stimulates the GTPase of normal ras gene product p21 but not of the mutated. An 
NF1 gene was identified as a gene whose loss of function causes an onset of 
human disorder, neurofibromatosis type I. The NF1 gene encodes a protein which 
contains a region with a similarity to the catalytic domain of p120GAP. We 
recently purified a novel Ras GAP whose molecular weight and immunogenecity are 
different from those of p120GAP and NF1. We named the novel mammalian Ras GAP as 
Gap1m. Isolation and sequencing of Gap1m cDNA revealed that Gap1m is indeed a 
novel Ras GAP. We also succeeded in isolation of another novel Ras GAP gene, 
GapIII/Gap1IP4BP, which is closely related to Gap1m. Recently, it is shown that 
GapIII/Gap1IP4BP binds inositol-tetrakis phosphate compounds. The overview of 
these Ras GAP molecules is described."
8699962,"The POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammapathy, 
and skin changes) syndrome is a rare variant of plasma cell dyscrasia with 
multisystemic manifestations. We present 4 cases with arterial symptoms typical 
of acute arterial obliteration (AAO) and review 9 similar cases in the 
literature. The clinical course of AAO was unusual and particularly severe when 
affecting the lower limbs; recurrent events required amputations. As 
demonstrated by angiographic and histologic studies, thrombotic and atheromatous 
lesions were the main pathologic features of AAO. Atherosclerotic risk factors 
were absent or moderate in 3 of our cases, and no cause of thrombosis other than 
the POEMS syndrome was found. A high production of cytokines was found in all 
cases, with elevated serum levels of interleukin-1 beta (9/9 samples), 
interleukin-6 (7/9 samples), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (6/9 samples). We 
suggest that arterial manifestations should be added to the spectrum of 
manifestations of the POEMS syndrome. Cytokines may mediate the POEMS 
syndrome-associated AAO, as previously proposed for the other systemic 
manifestations of this disorder."
8702907,"We have previously shown that the proximal 2-kb sequence of the fatty acid 
synthase (FAS) promoter transfected into rat adipocytes was highly sensitive to 
the cellular context, displaying an overactivity in obese (fa/fa) versus lean 
Zucker rat adipocytes. Using deletional analysis, we show here that FAS promoter 
activity mainly depends on a region from -200 to -126. This sequence exerts a 
strong negative effect on FAS promoter in adipocytes from lean rats but not in 
those from obese rats, resulting in a marked overtranscriptional activity in the 
latter cells. This region, fused to a heterologous promoter, the E1b TATA box, 
induced differential levels of gene reporter activity in lean and obese rat 
adipocytes, indicating it harbors fa-responsive element(s). Whatever the rat 
genotype, adipocyte nuclear proteins were shown to footprint the same protected 
sequence within the fa-responsive region, and supershift analysis demonstrated 
that Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins were bound to this DNA subregion. Compelling 
evidence that the Sp1 binding site contained in this sequence was implicated in 
the differential promoter activity in lean versus obese rats, was provided by 
the observation that mutations at this Sp1 site induced a 2.5-fold increase in 
FAS promoter activity in adipocytes from lean rats, whereas they had no effect 
in adipocytes from obese rats."
8702928,"Transcription when coupled to nucleotide excision repair specifies the location 
in active genes where preferential DNA repair is to take place. During DNA 
damage-induced recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP), there is a physical 
association of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNAP and the UvrA component 
of the repair apparatus (G. C. Lin and L. Grossman, submitted for publication). 
This molecular affinity is reflected in the ability of the RNAP to increase, in 
a promoter-dependent manner, DNA supercoiling by the UvrAB complex. In the 
presence of the RNAP, the UvrAB complex is able to bind to promoter regions and 
to translocate in a 5' to 3' direction along the non-transcribed strand. As a 
consequence of this helicase-catalyzed translocation, preferential incision of 
DNA damaged sites occurs downstream on the transcribed strand. Because of the 
helicase directionality, the initial binding of the UvrAB complex to the 
transcribed strand would inevitably lead to its collision with the RNAP. These 
results imply that the RNAP-induced DNA structure in the vicinity of the 
transcription start site signals a landing or entry site for the UvrAB complex 
on DNA."
8702967,"There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions 
between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains, but there is less clear evidence for 
regulatory interactions in the transmembrane domains of the two proteins. We 
have now coexpressed SERCA isoforms with the transmembrane sequence of PLN and 
with epitope-tagged transmembrane sequences of PLN to study intramembrane 
interactions in the absence of cytoplasmic interactions. Coexpression of the 
transmembrane sequence of phospholamban (Met-PLN28-52) with SERCA1a, SERCA2a, 
and SERCA3 inhibited Ca2+ transport by lowering apparent Ca2+ affinity. Addition 
of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope to the transmembrane sequence of PLN 
(HA-PLN28-52) or deletion of PLN residues 21-29 (PLN1-20-PLN30-52) 
""supershifted"" apparent Ca2+ affinity to values lower than those observed with 
native PLN without uncoupling Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis. Inhibition by 
PLN1-20-PLN30-52 or by Flag-PLN28-52 was reversed by PLN antibody or by Flag 
antibody, demonstrating that inhibition by these constructs is reversible and 
that the inhibitory constructs are properly oriented in the membrane. These 
results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through 
intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert 
with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions."
8706311,"OBJECTIVE: Pendred's syndrome is an association between congenital neurosensory 
deafness and goitre with abnormal discharge of iodide following perchlorate 
challenge, indicating a defect of iodide organification. Although Pendred's 
syndrome may cause up to 7.5% of all cases of congenital deafness, the molecular 
basis of the association between the hearing loss and the thyroid organification 
defect remains unknown. We chose to investigate the role of the thyroid 
peroxidase (TPO) gene as the genetic defect in Pendred's syndrome.
DESIGN: A highly informative variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), located 1.5 
kb downstream of exon 10 of the TPO gene, was used to search for genetic linkage 
in multiple sibships affected by Pendred's syndrome.
PATIENTS: Seven kindreds were recruited from the UK, each with at least two 
affected members. We have also examined a large inbred Israeli family with two 
affected offspring and five unaffected children.
MEASUREMENTS: Individuals were assigned affected status based on the 
characteristic clinical features of Pendred's syndrome, namely the presence of 
congenital sensorineural hearing loss and the appearance in early life of a 
goitre. Additionally, at least one affected member from each sibship had a 
characteristic positive perchlorate discharge test (Morgans & Trotter, 1958). 
PCR amplification of genomic DNA at the TPO VNTR allowed assignment of genotypes 
to each individual and the calculation of a two-point LOD score.
RESULTS: In six of the nine sibships analysed we found obligatory recombination 
between TPO and Pendred's syndrome. Non-complementation observed in affected 
parents with an affected offspring excluded TPO in an affected sibship with 
genotype sharing and supports a hypothesis of genetic homogeneity for Pendred's 
syndrome. In two sibships, mutation of the TPO gene as the cause of Pendred's 
syndrome could not be excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that defects at the thyroid peroxidase locus on 
chromosome 2 are not the major cause of Pendred's syndrome."
8707402,"Among the Nagasaki atomic-bomb survivors registered at the Scientific Data 
Center for Atomic-Bomb Disaster, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 45 
cases of surgically treated intracranial meningioma were collected from 6 
hospitals with departments of neurosurgery in or near Nagasaki City during the 
period from 1973 to 1992. All 45 patients were over 40 years of age at the time 
of diagnosis. Subsequently, the 45 cases were statistically analyzed in 
relationship to the estimated distance from the hypocenter by age, gender, 
intracranial location, histology and latent period. The analysis showed a high 
correlation between incidence of meningiomas and distance from the hypocenter. 
The incidence among Nagasaki atomic-bomb survivors over 40 years of age, 
especially in those proximally exposed, appears to be increasing, in inverse 
proportion to the exposure distance, since 1981, 36 years after the explosion of 
the atomic bomb."
8710121,"Retrospective psychological evaluation of nine patients with stiff-man syndrome 
(SMS), seven of whom evidenced autoimmune disease, revealed a characteristic set 
of psychological symptoms or features: Major stressful life events preceded the 
development of permanent symptoms by 6 months or less (seven patients); 
transient motor symptoms occurred in emotionally distressing situations months 
or even years before the onset of a permanent motor deficit (five patients); 
after onset, similar situations specifically precipitated or augmented stiffness 
and spasms (five patients). We also found task-specific fear resembling 
agoraphobia (six patients) and loss or invalidation of one or both parents, or 
loss of home, in childhood (seven patients). Eight patients were initially 
misdiagnosed as having psychogenic movement disorder. We conclude that the 
common misdiagnosis of SMS as a psychogenic movement disorder is due to the 
compelling association of a set of salient psychological features, bizarre and 
fluctuating motor symptoms, and lack of approved neurologic signs."
8710364,"Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 
subunit of NF-kappa B. To address the function of p105 precursor, we have 
generated embryonic stem (ES) cells which lack the C-terminal inhibiting 
ankyrin-containing domain of p105 (I kappa B gamma) but contain a functional p50 
by homologous recombination. Two forms of p50 were found in ES cells lacking 
p105. While one was a p50 molecule with the expected size of 415 amino acids, 
the other was an isoform of 358 amino acids generated by alternative splicing. 
This isoform lacked the C-terminal 62 amino acids of p50 including the putative 
nuclear localization signal (NLS), but included five unrelated amino acids. This 
p50 molecule lacking the NLS behaved similar to wild type p50. Importantly, the 
p50 isoform-RelA complex interacted efficiently with I kappa B alpha, implying 
that the NLS of p50 is not essential for these functions. Also, p50 isoform 
dimers were present in the nucleus. Loss of p105 and the augment of total p50 
produced an increase in the nuclear kappa B-binding activity of p50-RelA and p50 
dimers. In wild type ES cells, a significant proportion of total p50 is 
associated with p105. Therefore, the mutation introduced in NF-kappa B1 
eliminates both the processing to generate p50 and the trapping of p50 by p105. 
In contrast to p50, only a small fraction of RelA is associated with p105. These 
findings indicate that p105 plays a unique role in controlling p50 dimer 
activity."
8712177,"Seven solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the meninges are presented and their 
clinicopathologic features are compared with those of 64 fibrous meningiomas 
(FM). Patients with SFT included 5 females and 2 males age 47 to 73 years. The 
dura-based tumors involved the parasagittal region (1), tentorium (2), 
cerebellopontine angle (2), and spinal region (2). One each showed invasion of 
brain and of a spinal nerve root. Of four SFTs with at least 1-year follow-up, 
one subtotally resected example recurred. No tumors metastasized. All consisted 
of spindle cells disposed in fascicles between prominent, eosinophilic bands of 
collagen. Whorls and storiform cell arrangements were lacking. Mitoses ranged 
from 1 to 7/10 400 x fields. MIB-1 labeling indices ranged from 1% to 18% (mean 
4%). All were PAS negative and showed strong immunoreactivity for vimentin and 
CD34. Of cases studied, half were estrogen and all were progesterone receptor 
immunopositive. The majority (72%) of FMs occurred in females and most (72%) 
were supratentorial. Recurrence was noted in 15%. Mitotic activity varied from 0 
to 3 mitoses per 10 400 x fields (mean < 1). MIB-1 labeling indices ranged from 
1% to 5% (mean 1.5%). Unlike SFT, FMs were glycogen-containing and variously 
exhibited a storiform pattern (13 of 20), psammoma body formation (9 of 20), and 
calcification of collagen (4 of 20). Immunoreactivities included vimentin 
(100%), focal to patchy EMA (80%), S-100 protein (80%), collagen IV (25%), and 
patchy, mild-to-moderate CD34 staining (60%). Of cases studied, nearly half were 
estrogen and all were progesterone receptor staining positive. Meningeal SFTs 
represent a distinct morphologic entity, the morphologic and immunohistochemical 
features of which differ from those of FM and suggest a histogenetic 
relationship to pleural SFT. Although a minority histologically appear to be low 
grade malignant, our limited experience suggests that they behave in a benign 
fashion. The classification of mesenchymal tumors affecting the central nervous 
system must be expanded to include SFT."
8712223,"In light of the growing understanding of the toxic effects of glycated albumin 
and of the preferential excretion of this substance, the excretion of glycated 
albumin could be considered a physiologic function of the kidney. Furthermore, 
if the increased load of glycated albumin in diabetic patients results in 
glycated albumin excretion rates in the range of 20 to 200 microg/min, might 
this not be considered ""physiologic microalbuminuria""? The hypothesis is 
presented that microalbuminuria composed of glycated albumin is a homeostatic 
renal function. Although some proteins are glycosylated for their normal 
physiologic function, many proteins are glycated nonenzymatically according to 
ambient blood glucose. Albumin is subject to nonenzymatic glycation in all 
humans, but at increased rates in diabetic patients. Glycated albumin induces 
changes in the microvasculature and glomerulus that may lead to endothelial 
dysfunction and diabetic nephropathy, respectively. Renal excretion of glycated 
albumin is enhanced compared with native albumin. To explore this potential 
homeostatic function of the kidney, patients with impaired renal function were 
studied to determine whether glycated albumin accumulates. Plasma levels of 
glycated albumin were determined in diabetic and nondiabetic patients on 
hemodialysis. Hemoglobin A1c was used as an index of the rate of nonenzymatic 
glycation of proteins. Hemoglobin A1c was increased in the diabetic subjects but 
was normal in the nondiabetic group (7.9% +/- 0.5% v 6.2% +/- 0.2%, 
respectively; P < 0.01). On the other hand, the glycated albumin was elevated in 
both groups and was not significantly different between them (1.95% +/- 0.15% in 
the diabetic patients v 1.75% +/- 0.14% in the nondiabetic patients; P = NS). 
The results of this study provide the first clinical evidence supporting the 
hypothesis that the excretion of glycated albumin is a homeostatic renal 
function."
8717042,"Vesicular transport to and from the lysosome and late endosome is defective in 
patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) and in mutant beige (bg) mice. CHS 
and bg cells have giant, perinuclear vesicles with characteristics of late 
endosomes and lysosomes that arise from dysregulated homotypic fusion. CHS and 
bg lysosomes also exhibit compartmental missorting of proteins, such as 
elastase, glucuronidase and cathepsin G. Lyst, a candidate gene for bg, was 
identified by direct complementary DNA selection from a yeast artificial 
chromosome (YAC) clone containing a 650-kilobase segment of the bg-critical 
region on mouse chromosome 13. Lyst is disrupted by a 5-kilobase deletion in bg 
mice, and Lyst messenger RNA is markedly reduced in bg homozygotes. The 
homologous human gene, LYST, is highly conserved with mouse Lyst, and contains a 
frame-shift mutation at nucleotides 117-118 of the coding domain in a CHS 
patient. Thus bg mice and human CHS patients have homologous disorders 
associated with Lyst mutations. Lyst encodes a protein with a carboxy-terminal 
prenylation motif and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Lyst protein is 
predicted to form extended helical domains, and has a region of sequence similar 
to stathmin, a coiled-coil phosphoprotein thought to act as a relay integrating 
cellular signal response coupling."
8718666,"Addition of wortmannin to normal rat kidney cells caused a redistribution of the 
lysosomal type I integral membrane proteins Igp110 and Igp120 to a swollen 
vacuolar compartment. This compartment did not contain the cation independent 
mannose 6-phosphate receptor and was depleted in acid hydrolases. It was 
distinct from another swollen vacuolar compartment containing the cation 
independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The swollen Igp110-positive 
compartment was accessible to a monoclonal antibody against Igp120 added 
extracellularly, showing that it had the characteristics of an endosomal 
compartment. Wortmannin had no gross morphological effect on the trans-Golgi 
network or lysosomes nor any effect on the delivery to the trans-Golgi network 
of endocytosed antibodies against the type I membrane protein TGN38. We propose 
that the observed effects of wortmannin were due to inhibition of membrane 
traffic between cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor-positive late 
endosomes and the trans-Golgi network and to inhibition of membrane traffic 
between a novel Igp120-positive, cation independent mannose 6-phosphate 
receptor-negative late endosomal compartment and lysosomes. The effects of 
wortmannin suggest a function for a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(s) in 
regulating membrane traffic in the late endocytic pathway."
8718689,"Correct ligation of exons in pre-mRNA splicing requires splice site 
juxtaposition (splice site pairing), usually involving a 5' splice site and a 
downstream 3' splice site. Splicing of a 5' splice site to an upstream 3' splice 
site, however, is predicted to result in a circular RNA. This mode of splice 
site pairing across the axon has been hypothesized to account for rare RNAs 
containing scrambled exons (Nigro JM et al., 1991, Celt 64:607-613; Cocquerelle 
C et al., 1992, EMBO J 11:1 095-1098). Additionally, this mode of splice site 
pairing has been postulated to explain the formation of SRY circular transcripts 
in mouse testis (Capel B et al., 1993, Celt 73:1019- 1030). Here we show that 
splice site pairing across the exon can result in exon circularization in vitro. 
These results indicate that spliceosome-mediated axon circularization indeed can 
account for the formation of scrambled exons and circular RNAs. Exon 
circularization efficiency decreased dramatically as the length of the exon was 
increased from 95 nt to 274 nt. Circularization of this longer exon was 
restored, however, when intronic complementary sequences were included in the 
RNA substrate. These complementary sequences could form a stem that served to 
bring the splice sites into proximity and thereby promote splice site pairing. 
Therefore, the splicing of this structured RNA recapitulated SRY-like exon 
circularization in vitro."
8721925,"Pseudotumour cerebri is the name of a syndrome characterized by headache and 
papilloedema, with normal cerebral CT/MR studies and CSF with a high pressure 
and normal laboratory findings. We describe four patients who fulfilled the 
diagnostic criteria of this condition (including normal 0.5T MR studies). They 
all had cerebral angiograms showing minor abnormalities localized to the level 
of the superior longitudinal sinus. All improved on treatment with 
anticoagulants and steroids. In view of these findings we consider that in cases 
of pseudotumour cerebri without a clear aetiological factor, an angio MR study 
should be done, or if this technique is not available, a cerebral angiogram 
should be done, to exclude cerebral venous drainage defects."
8723064,"The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene is regarded as 
one of the candidates for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe two sibs with 
typical PWS presenting deletion of SNRPN detected by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH). Neither a cytogenetically detectable 15q12 deletion nor a 
deletion for the D15S11, D15S10, and GABRB3 cosmid probes were found in either 
patient. This implies a smaller deletion limited to the PWS critical region. 
FISH with a SNRPN probe will permit analysis of PWS patients with limited 
deletions not detectable with other probes."
8723065,"Lynch syndrome, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), is an 
autosomal-dominant disease accounting for approximately 1-5% of all colorectal 
cancer cases. Due to the lack of pathognomonic morphological or biomolecular 
markers, HNPCC has traditionally posed unique problems to clinicians and 
geneticists alike, both in terms of diagnosis and clinical management. Recently, 
novel insight into the pathogenesis of this syndrome has been provided by the 
identification of its molecular basis. In HNPCC families, germline mutations in 
any of four genes encoding proteins of a specialized DNA repair system, the 
mismatch repair, predispose to cancer development. Mutations in mismatch repair 
genes lead to an overall increase of the mutation rate and are associated with a 
phenotype of length instability of microsatellite loci. The present report 
summarizes the clinicopathological aspects of HNPCC and reviews the most recent 
molecular and biochemical findings."
8723114,"Conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in genital tissue is 
catalysed by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase 2, which is encoded by the SRD5A2 
gene. The potent androgen DHT is required for full masculinization of the 
external genitalia. Mutations of the SRD5A2 gene inhibit enzyme activity, 
diminish DHT formation, and hence cause masculinization defects of varying 
degree. The classical syndrome, formerly described as pseudovaginal 
perineoscrotal hypospadias, is characterized by a predominantly female phenotype 
at birth and significant virilization without gynecomastia at puberty. We 
investigated nine patients with steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency (SRD). 
Phenotypes, which were classified according to the severity of the 
masculinization defect, varied between completely female (SRD type 5), 
predominantly female (SRD type 4), ambiguous (SRD type 3), predominantly male 
with micropenis and hypospadias (SRD type 2), and completely male without overt 
signs of undermasculinization (SRD type 1). T/DHT-ratios were highly increased ( 
> 50) in the classical syndrome (SRD type 5), but variable in the less severe 
affected patients (SRD types 1-4) (14-35). Mutations in the SRD5A2 gene had been 
characterized using PCR-SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing. A small 
deletion was encountered in two patients, while all other patients had single 
base mutations which result in amino acid substitutions. We conclude that 
phenotypes may vary widely in patients with SRD5A2 gene mutations spanning the 
whole range from completely female to normal male without distinctive clinical 
signs of the disease. Hence, steroid 5 alpha-reductase deficiency should be 
considered not only in sex reversed patients with female or ambiguous 
phenotypes, but also in those with mild symptoms of undermasculinization as 
encountered in patients with hypospadias and/or micropenis. A classification 
based on the severity of the masculinization defect may be used for correlation 
of phenotypes with enzyme activities and genotypes, and for comparisons of 
phenotypes between different patients as the basis for clinical decisions to be 
made in patients with pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 
deficiency."
8725589,"Burning mouth syndrome is a common condition particularly affecting elderly 
women. Numerous precipitating factors are recognized that lead to a burning 
sensation in clinically normal mucosa. By taking each precipitating factor into 
account, a favorable treatment outcome usually can be achieved. This article 
highlights the significance of precipitating factors in burning mouth syndrome 
and suggests a treatment protocol based on current scientific evidence."
8725591,"The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology 
characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial 
paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The 
orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen, 
nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is 
indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to 
one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence 
assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete 
form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because 
monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis 
granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the 
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, 
sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably 
present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the 
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a 
disease with elements of orofacial granulomatosis. Orofacial granulomatosis is a 
clinicopathologic entity describing oral lesions with noncaseating granulomas. 
The spectrum of this entity includes patients with oral Crohn's disease, 
patients with oral lesions who will develop typical bowel symptoms of Crohn's 
disease in the ensuing months to years, patients with tooth-associated 
infections, patients with sarcoidosis, and patients with food or contact 
allergies. The value of the clinicopathologic construct of orofacial 
granulomatosis is to provoke the careful search for provocative causes for the 
reactive symptom complex of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome."
8726460,"BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (apoE) type epsilon 4 isoform specifies 
increased cerebral and cerebrovascular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (A 
beta) and contributes to the genetic susceptibility underlying a large 
proportion (approximately 60%) of typical, sporadic Alzheimer disease. 
Unfortunately, in vitro biochemical studies of direct apoE isoform-specific 
interactions with A beta have been inconsistent, perhaps due to the use by 
different research groups of apoE isoform preparations in different 
conformational states (purified denatured versus native).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, we have investigated the 
possibility that synthetic A beta(1-40) preferentially associates with native 
apoE of either the type epsilon 3 or the type epsilon 4 isoform.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the preferential association of synthetic A 
beta(1-40) with native apoE epsilon 3. The complex between apoE epsilon 3 and A 
beta(1-40) could not be disrupted by sodium dodecyl sulfate. In a parallel 
assay, no denaturant-resistant association of A beta(1-40) with apoE epsilon 4 
was detectable.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that the apoE epsilon 4 isoform 
may foster beta-amyloidogenesis because apoE epsilon 4 is inefficient in forming 
complexes with A beta."
8727067,"In contrast to the inner structure, three-dimensional structure of psammona 
bodies in meningiomas is not well defined. This study examined three cultured 
meningiomas, in which surface observation of psammoma bodies might be easier 
than in the tumor tissues since influence of interposing connective tissue is 
minimized in tissue culture. Early culture revealed that psammoma bodies with 
frank calcification were suspended in the tissue culture medium, and so were 
they collected, centrifuged, and then processed for electron microscopy. 
Ultrastructurally, psammoma bodies were mostly spherical in shape and composed 
of a core of dense calcification and surrounding collagen fiber bundles. Apart 
from psammoma bodies, round bodies with concentric lamination like a 
transversely cut onion were frequently noted by light microscopy. These bodies 
were composed mainly of tangles of collagen fibers emerged from surrounding 
tumor cell processes. The results suggest that psammoma bodies in meningiomas 
arise in part from meningothelial whorls due to collagen production by tumor 
cells followed by obliteration and disappearance of tumor cell processes, 
although some of the alternative pathways for psammoma body formation proposed 
by other investigators cannot be ruled out by this study."
8731171,"While the formalin test is a widely used behavioral model of tonic chemogenic 
pain, little is known about the responses of primary afferent nociceptors to 
formalin. Formalin (2.5%, 50 microliters) was injected either directly in or 
adjacent to the mechanical receptive fields of single C-fibers isolated from the 
saphenous nerve of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The average formalin-evoked 
response in C-fibers (n = 29) over time was biphasic. This biphasic time course 
of the C-fiber response to formalin is similar to that of the behavioral 
response in the awake animal and is compatible with the hypothesis that 
increased C-fiber activity contributes to the behavioral response in phase 2, as 
well as in phase 1 of the formalin test."
8733162,"Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare skin disorder, usually considered a 
marker for diabetes mellitus. More than half of the patients with necrobiosis 
lipoidica diabeticorum have diabetes mellitus, but less than one per cent of 
diabetes mellitus patients have necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. In the 
diabetes and dermatology literature, we find the position that there is no 
effect of glucose control on either the appearance of necrobiosis lipoidica 
diabeticorum or the clinical course of the lesion. We base our challenge to this 
position on a critical review of the original data. And conclude on the 
contrary, that necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is usually associated with 
poor glucose control and that tighter glucose control, as currently practised, 
might improve or prevent the disorder."
8733409,"The turning point in antimicrobial therapy of Mycobacterium avium infections 
came with the development of two new macrolides, clarithromycin and 
azithromycin. Controlled clinical trials, the first ever conducted with any 
agent among patients with M. avium infection, indicated the high efficiency of 
clarithromycin, in either acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients 
having a disseminated infection or non-AIDS patients with localized pulmonary 
disease. Monotherapy with clarithromycin resulted in elimination of bacteremia 
in almost all patients with disseminated infection, which is inevitably followed 
by a relapse of bacteremia in patients who survived long enough to reach this 
event. The strains susceptible to clarithromycin isolated before therapy 
contained 10(-8) or 10(-9) resistant mutants, and the relapses of bacteremia 
were caused by multiplication of these pre-existing mutants. 
Clarithromycin-resistance was associated with a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. 
Cross-resistance between clarithromycin and azithromycin was confirmed with 
laboratory mutants and clinical isolates. At least two methods for determining 
the susceptibility of the M. avium isolates to clarithromycin are available: one 
is minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination on Mueller-Hinton agar 
(pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% Oleic acid-albumin-dextrose catalase, the other 
is MIC determination in 7H12 broth, also at pH 7.4. The breakpoints for 
'susceptible' for these methods are < or = 8.0 micrograms/ml and < or = 2.0 
micrograms/ml, respectively. The breakpoints for 'resistant' are > 128 
micrograms/ml for the agar method and > 32.0 micrograms/ml for the broth method. 
The predictability value of MIC determination was confirmed by comparing the 
test results with the patients' clinical and bacteriological response to 
therapy. The remaining major problem in the therapy of the M. avium infections 
is a selection of companion drugs to be used in combination with clarithromycin 
(or azithromycin) to prevent the emergence of the macrolide-resistance. A number 
of clinical trials are now in progress to find a solution to this problem."
8735623,"1. Ranolazine has protective effects against ischaemia as exemplified by a 
reduction of the associated enzyme release and an attenuation of the fall of ATP 
and other metabolic changes. It has been suggested that ranolazine may affect 
GTP-binding proteins involved in the beta-adrenergic protein kinase A (PKA) 
cascade by interacting with Gs. Calcium channel currents are stimulated by this 
cascade but the effect of ranolazine upon them is not known. The whole cell 
patch clamp technique was used to examine the action of ranolazine on basal 
calcium channel currents and those stimulated by activation at various steps in 
the PKA cascade. 2. Ranolazine had only a small effect on the basal calcium 
current (100 microM caused 11.3% inhibition), but markedly attenuated the 
beta-adrenoceptor stimulated current (20 nM isoprenaline increased current by 
2.3 fold, 10 microM ranolazine inhibited this increase by 47.6%). When the PKA 
cascade was activated downstream to the receptor by either G-protein activation 
with Gpp[NH]p or adenylate cyclase activation with forskolin, the calcium 
current showed a sensitivity to ranolazine similar to the basal current. 
Activation of the PKA cascade via H2 receptors gave rise to currents which 
showed an intermediate sensitivity to ranolazine. Ranolazine inhibition of ICa 
persisted during muscarinic attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor activation. 3. The 
results indicate that ranolazine, at concentrations which have significantly 
beneficial effects during ischaemic episodes, only greatly affects whole cell 
calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor 
activation. Ranolazine would appear to act at the receptor level, rather than at 
the GTP-binding or Gs/adenylate cyclase level. An additional smaller effect is 
also present, which may be mediated by a direct effect on the channel, or 
components closely associated with it."
8735716,"The abnormal expression of blood group related antigens has been reported in 
many malignant tumours; however, such expression in cholangiocarcinoma has not 
been examined systematically. The expression of blood group-related antigens (A, 
B, H, Lewis(a), Lewis(b), Lewis(x), Lewis(y), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and 
carcinoembryonic antigen) was investigated immunohistochemically in 75 cases of 
cholangiocarcinoma (31 peripheral type and 44 hilar type). In non-neoplastic 
bile ducts, A, B, and H antigens were expressed in large bile ducts, while 
Lewis(a,b,y) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were variably expressed in both large 
and small bile ducts. Lewis(x) and carcinoembryonic antigen was not found in 
non-neoplastic bile ducts. In cholangiocarcinomas, A, B, and H, antigens were 
more frequent in the hilar type than in the peripheral type, although the 
difference was not significant. The expression of the blood-group related 
antigens, particularly A, Lewis(a,b,y), carcinoembryonic antigen, and 
carbohydrate antigen 19-9, was frequent in the tumour cells in well 
differentiated adenocarcinomas, while their immunoreactivity was less frequent 
in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The superanuclear and luminal 
expression of these antigens in carcinoma cells was frequent in well 
differentiated adenocarcinomas, and the diffuse, cell membranous and stromal 
expression of these antigens was relatively frequent in poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinoma. The A, B, and H immunoreactivity of 
both non-neoplastic bile ducts and cholangiocarcinomas was consistent with the 
host blood group type. These findings suggest that both the expression and 
intracellular distribution of blood group-related antigens in cholangiocarcinoma 
are related to the differentiation of cholangiocarcinoma and, possibly, to the 
parent structure."
8737119,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) following cerebral aneurysm rupture or trauma can 
result in the induction of secondary ischaemic brain damage via a decrease in 
microvascular perfusion, a disruption of the blood-brain barrier and consequent 
vasogenic oedema, and the delayed spasm of the major cerebral arteries (i.e. 
vasospasm). It is increasingly apparent that oxygen radical-induced, 
iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation (LP) within the subarachnoid blood and 
vascular wall plays a key role in the occurrence of these secondary events. 
Tirilazad mesylate is a potent cytoprotective inhibitor of LP that works by a 
combination of radical scavenging and membrane stabilizing properties. It has 
been demonstrated to attenuate the acute and delayed vascular consequences of 
SAH and to protect the brain against ischaemic insults. Much of its action is 
mediated by an effect on the vascular endothelium, although it also appears to 
exert some direct neuroprotection and to inhibit LP in the subarachnoid blood. 
These actions of tirilazad in experimental SAH are reviewed."
8737616,"Thirty-six women with ultrasonographic diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma 
(bilateral in nine of them), have been treated laparoscopically. After the 
surgical procedure the patients were assigned to one of the following regimes: 
Gn-RH-a for 3 months, oral contraceptives if they wanted to avoid pregnancy, or 
nothing. The follow-up consisted in 1-3-6-12 months ultrasound. The first 
recurrences were observed at the 6-month ultrasound with an overall recurrence 
rate after 12 months of 11%. Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the 
patients and fertility rate was 45%."
8738633,"King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically 
normal hearing threshold. The main reported disability is hearing speech in the 
presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in 
patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the 
Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI 
scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors 
determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in 
patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a 
considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main 
findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in 
noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI 
scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency 
resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the 
performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI 
scores. These two variables appear to be the main determinants of speech-hearing 
disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome."
8740138,"The Currarino triad is a hereditary transmitted syndrome, originally defined by 
Currarino as ASP-association, consisting of an anorectal malformation, a sacral 
bony defect and a presacral mass. In most cases autosomal dominant transmission 
is suggested. In family members one or two features of the syndrome may be 
missing, indicating an incomplete form of this complex. We describe two 
unrelated girls at the age of 8 and 9 months respectively with ASP-association. 
Family screening in both patients showed 8 additional cases with a complete or 
incomplete Currarino triad, four of them being asymptomatic. A review of the 
literature up to 1991 revealed 48 patients with ASP-association. In more than 
80% of cases, this complex is diagnosed in the first decade, whereas incomplete 
Currarino syndrome is diagnosed predominantly in adults. Most frequently the 
presacral mass in ASP-association was reported to be an anterior meningocele 
(47%) and a benign teratoma (40%). The number of patients with Currarino 
syndrome has been underestimated so far. We recommend anorectal examination, 
pelvic ultrasound and pelvic x-rays in all patients with a history of chronic 
constipation since early childhood. Positive findings should lead to further 
investigations such as barium enema, MRI, myelography and family screening. 
Close cooperation between pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons is required to 
ensure adequate surgical treatment, considering both the risk of malignant 
degeneration as well as the risk of intraoperative nerve damage. Thus, radical 
excisional surgery is not obligatory in every case of Currarino syndrome."
8782069,"Bradykinin and prostaglandins are established mediators of exudative and 
inflammatory phases of healing. Their contribution to the fibrogenic component 
of healing in the heart is less certain. We therefore undertook the present 
study in rats with acute myocardial infarction (MI) following left coronary 
artery ligation. Treatment with a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (Hoe140, 0.5 
microgram/kg/min s.c.) or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin, 2 mg/kg 
p.o.), initiated 24 h after surgery, was examined for responses in MI topography 
(size and area), MI and nonMI tissue fibrosis (fibrillar collagen specific 
picrosirius red). Early (week 1) and late (week 4) phases of fibrogenesis postMI 
were examined. Compared to control, we found: (1) MI size at weeks 1 and 4 was 
comparable in untreated and treated rats: (2) infarct area, a measure of scar 
thickness, was reduced (P < 0.05) at week 4 by each intervention; and (3) 
densitometric collagen volume fraction did not reveal a reduction in collagen 
accumulation at the MI site, but this was evident remote to the MI (P < 0.05) at 
week 4 for each agent. Thus, pharmacological interference with 
bradykinin-receptor binding or prostaglandin synthesis following MI is 
associated with reduced fibrillar collagen formation. Though the mechanism 
responsible for observed alteration in fibrogenesis is uncertain, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties of these agents may be 
responsible."
8782820,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele is associated with Alzheimer's disease, 
cardiovascular disease, and decreased longevity. To probe the mechanism of these 
associations, cell lines were created which secrete each apoE isoform. ApoE 
conditioned media, purified apoE, and commercially obtained apoE protected B12 
cells from hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity with E2 > E3 > E4. Physiological 
levels of apoE protected cells from beta-amyloid peptides, while higher doses of 
apoE led to increased cytotoxicity. E2 > E3 > E4 possessed antioxidant activity, 
and apoE bound certain metal ions. The decreased antioxidant activity of E4 
could contribute to its association with Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular 
disease and decreased longevity."
8783263,"In situ hybridization was used to measure the expression of members of the 
Fos/Jun family of immediate-early genes in hypothalamic neurons in vivo 
following defined stimuli that utilize different afferent pathways. Only c-jun 
messenger RNA was expressed in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular 
nuclei of control animals. Intravenous infusions of sodium chloride solutions of 
different tonicity produced a range of plasma osmolalities within physiological 
limits. While the induction of c-fos and jun B messenger RNAs followed the 
stimulus intensity, the expression of c-jun was repressed at low levels of 
stimulation. A higher level of osmotic stimulation was able to co-induce c-jun 
with the c-fos, jun B and fos B genes, suggesting that other signalling pathways 
may then be activated. Parturition or systemic administration of 
cholecystokinin, that activate supraoptic and paraventricular neurons via 
ascending afferent pathways from the brainstem, both induced c-fos, but not the 
other genes, in the magnocellular nuclei. Use of double in situ hybridization 
confirmed that, unlike with osmotic stimulation, induction of c-fos only 
occurred in oxytocin neurons. These two stimuli did not cause a concomitant 
repression of c-jun messenger RNA expression in magnocellular oxytocin neurons. 
These patterns of induction provide evidence for the differential regulation of 
members of this family of genes in a physiological context."
8783669,"Controlled clinical trials indicate that amifostine (WR-2721, Ethyol) confers 
protection from the cumulative hematologic toxicities associated with alkylating 
agents and organoplatinums. To determine whether amifostine protects primitive 
hematopoietic progenitors from the cytotoxicity of functionally diverse 
antineoplastics, formation of the multipotent hematopoietic progenitors 
colony-forming units-granulocyte-erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) 
and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) was evaluated using a clonogenic 
progenitor inhibition assay. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from normal donors 
were subjected to a 15-minute exposure of medium, amifostine (500 micromol/L), 
or WR-1065 (100 micromol/L at concentrations approximating peak plasma levels, 
washed twice, then treated with the antineoplastic for 1 to 6 hours. Colony 
growth was scored after 14 days of incubation. Amifostine conferred protection 
against a broader range of antineoplastics than did WR-1065. Amifostine 
protected CFU-GEMM against cytotoxicity from daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, and 
paclitaxel (range, 1.29- to 9.57-fold) (P < .05) but did not afford protection 
against cisplatin, diaziquone, or thiotepa. Similarly, amifostine protected 
BFU-E against toxicity from doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, cisplatin, 
and diaziquone, yielding 3.4- to 65-fold greater colony recovery compared with 
controls. The high degree of cytoprotection afforded by amifostine derived 
largely from stimulation of progenitor growth at sublethal chemotherapy 
concentrations. In the absence of antineoplastic exposure, preincubation with 
amifostine or WR-1065 enhanced the colony-forming capacity of bone marrow 
progenitors from six normal donors, increasing recovery of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E up 
to sevenfold. We conclude that amifostine protects primitive hematopoietic 
progenitors from a wide range of antineoplastics. This broad hemoprotective 
effect derives in part from inherent trophic effects on progenitor growth and 
survival."
8783671,"Preclinical studies demonstrate that amifostine has the potential to selectively 
protect normal tissues from the harmful effects of radiation without 
significantly protecting neoplastic tissue. The potential value of such an agent 
includes reducing treatment-related toxicity and the opportunity for radiation 
dose escalation in the curative treatment of cancer. An increasing number of 
human clinical trials have been conducted that define the toxicity profile and 
efficacy of radioprotection by amifostine when used during fractionated 
radiation therapy. These trials demonstrate that amifostine is safe and 
practical to administer in the outpatient setting during fractionated radiation 
therapy. These studies also illustrate the challenge of accurately evaluating 
the end point of radioprotection in the clinical setting. This article reviews 
the recent clinical literature on amifostine, the evidence for normal tissue 
protection, and the lack of tumor protection by this agent, and suggests 
possible avenues for future investigation and application of this agent in the 
field of radiation oncology."
8784230,"Flurodopa (FDOPA) is an analogue of L-di-hydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) used to 
assess the nigrostriatal dopamine system in vivo with positron emission 
tomography (PET). However, FDOPA/PET quantitation is complicated by the presence 
of the 3-O-methyl-FDOPA (3OMFD) fraction in brain and plasma. Pretreatment with 
entacapone (OR-611), a peripheral catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT) 
inhibitor, greatly reduces the plasma 3OMFD fraction and provides an ideal 
situation to evaluate the contribution of the plasma 3OMFD fraction in several 
kinetic models of FDOPA uptake. We performed FDOPA/PET with and without the 
OR-611 preadministration in six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We measured 
the time-course of the plasma FDOPA and 3OMFD fractions using high-pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC). We calculated striato-occipital ratios (SOR), and 
estimated the striatal FDOPA uptake rate constant graphically using the plasma 
FDOPA and occipital tissue time activity curves (KiFD and KiOCC, respectively). 
We also estimated striatal dopa decarboxylase (DDC) activity (k3D) using a model 
incorporating independent measurements of 3OMFD transport kinetic rate 
constants. With the preadministration of OR-611, the pharmacological efficiency 
in plasma was prolonged significantly (21.1-37.7%; p < 0.01). We also observed 
significant mean elevations in SOR and KiOCC by 21.8 and 53.5%, respectively (p 
< 0.05). KiFD and k3D did not show significant change. We conclude that OR-611 
prolongs the circulation time of FDOPA in the plasma but does not alter rate 
constants for striatal FDOPA uptake or decarboxylation."
8784575,"Diphtheria toxin (tox) and its regulatory element (dtxR) from 72 Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae strains isolated in Russia and Ukraine before and during the current 
diphtheria epidemic were studied by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism 
analysis (PCR-SSCP). Twelve sets of primers were constructed (eight for tox and 
four for dtxR), and three regions within tox and all four regions of dtxR showed 
significant variations in the number and/or sizes of the amplicons. Two to four 
different SSCP patterns were identified in each of the variable regions; 
subsequently, tox and dtxR could be classified into 6 and 12 different types, 
respectively. The great majority of epidemic strains from both Russia and 
Ukraine had tox types 3 and 4, and only in a single preepidemic strain isolated 
in Russia were all eight tox regions identical to those of C. diphtheriae 
Park-Williams No. 8 (tox type 1). Epidemic strains from Ukraine can easily be 
identified by dtxR type 5, while the majority of the Russian epidemic strains 
have dtxR of types 2 and 8. No differences in the tox regions between mitis and 
gravis biotype strains were observed. However, dtxR types 2, 5, and 8 were 
identified only in the gravis biotype, and dtxR type 1 was characteristic for 
the mitis biotype strains. PCR-SSCP is a simple and rapid method for the 
identification of variable tox and dtxR regions that allows for the clear 
association of tox and dtxR types with strains of distinct temporal and/or 
geographic origins."
8784713,"Lemierre's syndrome, a systemic anaerobic infection caused by Fusobacterium 
necrophorum, is characterized by an acute oropharyngeal infection, septic 
thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, sepsis, and multiple metastatic 
infections. It commonly leads to septic arthritis and occasionally to 
osteomyelitis. In the preantibiotic era, this infection was nearly universally 
fatal. Today it still poses a potentially grave threat to the young patients 
affected. Prompt recognition with appropriate debridement and antibiotic 
treatment results in complete recovery in most cases. We report a case of 
anaerobic septic arthritis and multifocal acute hematogenous osteomyelitis as 
part of a classic presentation of Lemierre's syndrome."
8785513,"In a previous work, we have isolated the human H19 gene and shown accumulation 
of transcripts in various human tumors including breast carcinomas (Douc-Rasy et 
al (1993) Int J Oncol 2, 753-758). Questions arose, after Northern blot results, 
about the precise H19 mRNA location, specially in normal breast tissues and 
benign or malign primary breast tumors. Then we performed molecular in situ 
hybridization to get insight into tissue expression of the H19 gene. Examined 
resections included one normal tissue, one fibroadenoma and 13 cancers. Results 
obtained with the H19 probe can be summarized as follows: 1) in normal breast 
tissues signals were focally observed in epithelial cells, but more 
predominantly in the palleal tissue which is sensitive to hormones; 2) in the 
fibroadenoma, fibroblastic cells were extensively labeled at the 
stroma-epithelium boundary, but epithelial cells were negative; and 3) in 
primary cancers, eight specimens exhibited signals on stromal cells, one 
specimen on epithelial cells and four on both epithelial and stromal cells. Data 
provide the following evidence: 1) usually labeled cells are clustered, either 
within normal or pathological tissues; 2) the labeling pattern highly differs 
from one tumor to another; and 3) H19 probe displays very different signals from 
one cell to another in given compartment of a given tissue section. In 
conclusion, it seems that a high H19 expression matches the tumor invasion. Our 
results suggest that the expression of this gene is concerned by the 
relationships between epithelial and stromal cells, and can reflect peculiar 
physiological states of the cells. Furthermore, we discuss results showing an 
abundant expression of H19 gene in some adenocarcinomas of bad prognosis, in the 
context of the otherwise established tumor-suppressor role of this gene, or the 
strictly controlled gene dosage, which could be overridden in these particular 
cases."
8791410,"The septins are a novel family of proteins that were first recognized in yeast 
as proteins associated with the neck filaments. Recent work has shown that 
septins are also present in other fungi, insects, and vertebrates. Despite the 
apparent differences in modes of cytokinesis amongst species, septins appear to 
be essential for this process in both fungal and animal cells. The septins also 
appear to be involved in various other aspects of the organization of the cell 
surface."
8792025,"High-intensity resistance (HIR) training has been associated with muscle 
hypertrophy and decreased microvascular density that might produce a blood flow 
limitation. The effect of HIR training on lower leg maximal blood flow and 
minimum vascular resistance (Rmin) during reactive hyperemia were investigated 
in 7 healthy males. The gastrocnemius-soleus muscles of one leg were trained 
using maximal isokinetic concentric contractions for 4 weeks; the nontrained leg 
was the control. Lower leg blood flow was measured by venous occlusion 
plethysmography. Lower leg muscle volume was determined using magnetic resonance 
imaging. Peak isokinetic torque increased in both the trained (T) and nontrained 
(NT) legs (p < .05). Lower leg muscle volume increased by 2% in the T leg only 
(p < .05). In the T leg, maximal blood flow decreased and Rmin increased (p < 
.05); no hemodynamic change was detected in the NT leg. It is concluded that HIR 
training of the calf muscles is associated with a decrease in hyperemia-induced 
blood flow; thereby, indicating a blood flow limitation to the calf muscles."
8792056,"Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to 
potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; 
(ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. 
An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly 
with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the 
interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often 
coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. 
Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an 
interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium 
antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs 
which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various 
mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. 
miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., 
sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. 
cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting 
platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are 
rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a 
drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a 
sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or 
sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy 
makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of 
anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems 
advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or 
deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of 
this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset 
of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 
3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. 
With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months 
after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or 
nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of 
coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance 
the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin."
8793089,"We have investigated the participation of the N-type (omega-conotoxin 
GVIA-sensitive) and L-type (nifedipine-sensitive) calcium channels in the alpha 
2-adrenoceptor mediated autoinhibition of the release of [3H]noradrenaline from 
chick sympathetic neurons in culture. Blockade of 3,4-diaminopyridine-sensitive 
potassium channels resulted in tetrodotoxin-sensitive and calcium-dependent 
increase of the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by electrical stimulation. 
Nifedipine attenuated the evoked release under control conditions by 20%, but in 
the presence of 3,4-diaminopyridine by 51%, while omega-conotoxin decreased the 
release under control conditions by 87% and in the presence of 
3,4-diaminopyridine by only 43%. The L-type calcium channel activator Bay k 8644 
increased the evoked release of the transmitter both in the absence and in the 
presence of 3,4-diaminopyridine. Under control conditions, the alpha 
2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 decreased the evoked release by 57% and the 
alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine increased it by 14%. Nifedipine did 
not prevent this modulation. In the presence of 3,4-diaminopyridine, UK 14304 
lost its effect on the release of noradrenaline, but its inhibitory action was 
restored when nifedipine, but not omega-conotoxin, was added. Changes in the 
increase of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) evoked by electrical 
stimulation, measured in the cell processes by microfluorimetry, paralleled the 
changes in the release of [3H]noradrenaline. Under control conditions, 
nifedipine attenuated the rise of intracellular calcium by only 16%, while 
omega-conotoxin did so by 66%. 3,4-Diaminopyridine enhanced the evoked rise of 
[Ca2+]i; in its presence the rise of intracellular calcium was about equally 
reduced by nifedipine and omega-conotoxin (by 46 and 36%, respectively). These 
effects were additive. UK 14304 diminished the peak concentration of [Ca2+]i 
elicited by the standard electrical stimulation by 31% and rauwolscine 
antagonised this effect. UK 14304 did not measurably inhibit the 
stimulation-evoked rise of intraterminal [Ca2+]i in the presence of 
3,4-diaminopyridine but it produced an inhibition by 26% if nifedipine had been 
applied together with 3,4-diaminopyridine. Our observations show that, under 
control conditions, the stimulated release of [3H]noradrenaline is mainly 
associated with the opening of N-type channels, while in the presence of 
3,4-diaminopyridine the contribution of L-type channels becomes more important. 
The alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation by UK 14304 inhibits the release of 
[3H]noradrenaline but, in the presence of 3,4-diaminopyridine, the inhibition of 
release can only be observed if the massive influx through L-type calcium 
channels is prevented. These data suggest that presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors 
of chick sympathetic neurons preferentially influence the N-type calcium 
channels."
8794857,"Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the 
basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. 
This protein exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a zinc finger domain 
flanked by large (60-70 kD) NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. When full-length 
human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the 
nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. Targeting information for Nup153 
resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct 
an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the 
nuclear pore complex. Overexpression of Nup153 results in the dramatic 
accumulation of nuclear poly (A)+ RNA, suggesting an inhibition of RNA export 
from the nucleus. This is not due to a general decline in nucleocytoplasmic 
transport or to occlusion or loss of nuclear pore complexes since nuclear 
protein import is unaffected. While overexpression of certain Nup153 constructs 
was found to result in the formation of unusual intranuclear membrane arrays, 
this structural phenotype could not be correlated with the effects on poly (A)+ 
RNA distribution. The RNA trafficking defect was, however, dependent upon the 
Nup153 COOH-terminal domain which contains most of the XFXFG repeats. It is 
proposed that this region of Nup153, lying within the distal ring of the nuclear 
basket, represents a docking site for mRNA molecules exiting the nucleus."
8795688,"The lineage involvement in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is still unclear. To 
determine the clonality and the evolution of the disorder, a retrospective study 
on bone marrow smears from seven MDS patients with trisomy 8 was performed using 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We observed that the trisomy of 
chromosome 8 was selectively expressed in the myeloid-derived cells. No mature 
lymphocytes or plasma cells expressed three signals. Our studies demonstrate 
here the value of FISH for identifying the affected cell lineage. Furthermore, 
the easy quantification of the abnormal cells can help in assessing the 
progression of the disease."
8798387,"Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is an RNA polymerase II binding 
protein that allows bypass of template arrest sites by activating a nascent RNA 
cleavage reaction. Here we show that SII contacts the 3'-end of nascent RNA 
within an RNA polymerase II elongation complex as detected by photoaffinity 
labeling. Photocross-linking was dependent upon the presence of SII, 
incorporation of 4-thio-UMP into RNA, and irradiation and was sensitive to 
treatment by RNase and proteinase. A transcriptionally active mutant of SII 
lacking the first 130 amino acids was also cross-linked to the nascent RNA, but 
SII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is inactive in concert with mammalian 
RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was 
not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex 
by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between 
elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of 
RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may 
activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in 
the enzyme's active site."
8798665,"Adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein (19K) is a member of the Bcl-2 family of 
suppressors of apoptosis. The suppressors function through heterodimerization 
with the death promoters, Bax and related proteins, thus establishing a set 
point within the cell that determines whether or not apoptosis is executed in 
response to a death signal. Sequence similarities between 19K and Bcl-2 are 
largely restricted to short Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains that mediate interaction 
with Bax. The BH1 sequence in 19K is degenerate but nevertheless contains a 
conserved glycine residue found in all family members that when mutated to 
alanine in Bcl-2 results in loss of Bcl-2 function and ability to dimerize with 
Bax (Yin, X.-M., Oltvai, Z. N., and Korsmeyer, S. J. (1994) Nature 369, 
321-323). Here, we show that the analogous mutation in BH1 of 19K also abrogates 
the anti-apoptotic properties of 19K and its ability to interact with Bax, thus 
establishing the critical importance of this residue within BH1 and the likely 
similarity of Bcl-2 and 19K function. In distinct contrast to Bcl-2, however, 
19K interaction was not detected with Bad, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL dimerizing protein 
that can potentially regulate a Bax middle dotBcl-2/Bcl-XL survival set point 
and reinstate susceptibility to a death signal. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic 
function of 19K was not overcome by enforced expression of Bad in transfected 
cells. This feature of 19K may provide adenovirus with a selective advantage in 
evading premature induction of apoptosis by the host cell."
8798672,"Primers for vertebrate mitochondrial leading-strand DNA replication are products 
of transcription synthesized by mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The precursor 
primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed 
during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. 
(1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). In an effort to examine the precise structure of 
this primer RNA intermediate, we have used two methods to reconstitute model 
R-loops containing the mouse mitochondrial DNA origin sequence. First, we 
demonstrate that bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase can efficiently catalyze the 
formation of an R-loop at the mouse mtDNA origin sequence. Second, the R-loop 
can be assembled by annealing presynthesized RNA and supercoiled DNA template in 
the presence of formamide. R-loop formation by either method is dependent on 
specific template sequences. The reconstituted R-loop is exceptionally stable 
and exhibits an unexpected structure. Structural studies indicate that the RNA 
strand is organized within the RNA-DNA base-paired region, suggesting that the 
heteroduplex interaction occurs through a specific conformation. We propose that 
the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in 
vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication 
machinery."
8800628,"A number of drugs are capable of changing bodyweight as an adverse effect of 
their therapeutic action. Bodyweight gain is more of a problem than bodyweight 
loss. As bodyweight gain during drug treatment for any kind of disease may be 
the reflection of improvement of the disease itself, we will try to separate 
these effects from those due to drug-induced alterations of the mechanisms 
regulating bodyweight. Bodyweight gain may jeopardise patient compliance to the 
prescribed regimen and it may pose health risks. The body mass index (BMI) is 
determined by dividing bodyweight in kilograms by height in metres squared. A 
BMI of > or = 27 kg/m2 warrants therapeutic action; nutritional counselling and 
programmed physical exercise can be used as a basis. In general, if basic 
therapeutic measures are unsuccessful at controlling bodyweight gain then a 
change of drug might help. Finally, an anoretic drug may serve to support 
dietary measures. However, safety and efficacy has been demonstrated for only a 
few anorectic drugs when used as an adjunct to caloric restriction in the 
treatment of drug-induced obesity. Bodyweight is determined by complex 
mechanisms regulating energy balance. A number of neurotransmitter systems 
acting in several hypothalamic nuclei are pivotal to the regulation of body fat 
stores. Most drugs that are capable of changing bodyweight interfere with these 
neurotransmitter systems. The increment is dependent on the type and dose of the 
drug concerned. Some antidepressant drugs induce bodyweight gain, which may 
amount to 20 kg over several months of treatment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
appear to cause less bodyweight change than tricyclic antidepressants. Selective 
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors cause bodyweight loss 
instead of bodyweight gain. Lithium may cause large increases in bodyweight. 
Generally speaking, the bodyweight change induced by antipsychotics is more 
often of clinical significance than the bodyweight change associated with the 
use of antidepressants. Again, the changes of bodyweight are dependent upon the 
type and dose of the antipsychotic drug involved. Although almost all 
antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce 
bodyweight loss. Anticonvulsants, especially valproic acid (sodium valproate) 
and carbamazepine, induce bodyweight gain in a considerable percentage of 
patients. Treatment with corticosteroids is associated with dose-dependent 
bodyweight gain in many patients. Corticosteroid-induced obesity aggravates 
other corticosteroid-associated health risks. Insulin therapy in diabetic 
patients usually increases bodyweight. Finally, sulphonurea derivatives, 
antineoplastic agents used for the treatment of breast cancer and several drugs 
used in migraine prophylaxis may cause bodyweight gain as well."
8801083,"Three split-virion vaccines (Vaxigrip, Begrivac, and Influsplit/Fluarix) and 
three subunit vaccines containing only viral surface glycoproteins (Influvac, 
Agrippal, and Fluvirin) available for the 1994-95 season were analysed by 
biological, molecular, and biochemical methods. Although all vaccines are 
required by health authorities to contain 15 micrograms haemagglutinin per dose 
of each virus strain, there were significant differences in haemagglutination 
titres among the examined vaccines of both types. The enzymatic activity of 
neuraminidase was present in all vaccines except Fluvirin. Total protein content 
was lower for subunit vaccines. Viral nucleoprotein was detected in all split 
vaccines but to varying levels according to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. 
The ovalbumin content was low in general but was about tenfold higher for 
Influvac than for the other vaccines analysed. This protein may induce 
hypersensitive reactions among persons with severe egg allergy. All three 
split-virion vaccines were found to contain the matrix protein; however, it was 
not detected in the subunit vaccines. Differences in influenza antigen variety 
in currently available vaccines may affect efficacy, whereas differences in 
concentrations of nonviral compounds such as ovalbumin and endotoxin may lead to 
different postvaccination reactogenicity profiles."
8803434,"A prospective case-control study was undertaken to assess respiratory disability 
in 133 former coal miners who were claimants for ""black lung"" benefits. 
Consecutive assignment was made to either case or control group based on their 
chest radiograph having shown coal workers' pneumoconiosis or no coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis. A respiratory occupational survey was completed with physical 
examination that placed special emphasis on the cardiorespiratory systems. 
Subjects underwent pulmonary function testing while 92 of these also received 
arterial blood gases to assess respiratory disability and pulmonary 
insufficiency. Arterial blood gases were superior to spirometry in assessment of 
pulmonary insufficiency/disability. Smoking interacts with coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis to cause pulmonary insufficiency. The most frequent spirometric 
pattern was obstructive. Disability was caused by occupational injuries and 
comorbidities, both of which occurred with greater frequency in miners with coal 
workers' pneumoconiosis than in controls. Pulmonary insufficiency appears to be 
a better discriminator than respiratory disability in coal miners, suggesting 
that arterial blood gases replace spirometry in their evaluation. Greater 
emphasis on smoking intervention among coal miners should be given."

8805338,"BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species, ionizing radiation, and other free radical 
generators initiate the conversion of guanine (G) residues in DNA to 
8-oxoguanine (OG), which is highly mutagenic as it preferentially mispairs with 
adenine (A) during replication. Bacteria counter this threat with a 
multicomponent system that excises the lesion, corrects OG:A mispairs and 
cleanses the nucleotide precursor pool of dOGTP. Although biochemical evidence 
has suggested the existence of base-excision DNA repair proteins specific for OG 
in eukaryotes, little is known about these proteins.
RESULTS: Using substrate-mimetic affinity chromatography followed by a 
mechanism-based covalent trapping procedure, we have isolated a base-excision 
DNA repair protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that processes OG opposite 
cytosine (OG:C) but acts only weakly on OG:A. A search of the yeast genome 
database using peptide sequences from the protein identified a gene, OGG1, 
encoding a predicted 43 kDa (376 amino acid) protein, identical to one 
identified independently by complementation cloning. Ogg1 has OG:C-specific 
base-excision DNA repair activity and also intrinsic beta-lyase activity, which 
proceeds through a Schiff base intermediate. Targeted disruption of the OGG1 
gene in yeast revealed a second OG glycosylase/lyase protein, tentatively named 
Ogg2, which differs from Ogg1 in that it preferentially acts on OG:G.
CONCLUSIONS: S. cerevisiae has two OG-specific glycosylase/lyases, which differ 
significantly in their preference for the base opposite the lesion. We suggest 
that one of these, Ogg1, is closely related in overall three-dimensional 
structure to Escherichia coli endonuclease III (endo III), a glycosylase/lyase 
that acts on fragmented and oxidatively damaged pyrimidines. We have recently 
shown that AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, 
is structurally homologous to endo III. We have now identified a shared active 
site motif amongst these three proteins. Using this motif as a protein database 
searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision 
DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions. Thus, we propose the existence 
of a DNA glycosylase superfamily, members of which possess a common fold yet act 
upon remarkably diverse lesions, ranging from UV photoadducts to mismatches to 
alkylated or oxidized bases."
8806843,"In the presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related 
chemicals, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) forms a heterodimeric 
complex with the ligand-bound Ah receptor, leading to recognition of 
dioxin-responsive elements within the enhancer of the CYP1A1 gene and 
transcription activation by an unknown mechanism. To understand the role of Arnt 
in transcription activation by the Ah receptor-Arnt heterodimer, we performed a 
deletion analysis of Arnt to locate domains that are directly involved in 
transcription activation. We showed that the C-terminal 34 amino acids of Arnt 
encode a transcription activation domain (TAD) that functions independently of 
other sequences in the Ah receptor complex when attached to the heterologous 
Gal4 DNA binding domain. Deletion of the C-terminal acidic-rich 14 amino acids 
completely abolishes activity. Sequences important in Arnt TAD function were 
independent of the glutamine-rich region which is an important structural 
feature in the TAD of other transcription factors. The strength of the Arnt TAD 
when compared with the strong TAD from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein was 
cell-type specific. Both the Arnt and VP16 TAD were equally strong in COS-1 
cells, but the Arnt TAD had weak activity in an Arnt-deficient mouse hepatoma 
cell line and was not needed for restoration of CYP1A1 activation. These results 
imply that for CYP1A1 activation the Ah receptor provides the dominant 
activation function for the heterodimer in hepatoma cells. The potential of the 
Arnt TAD to contribute to activation by the Ah receptor complex is likely 
determined by availability or activity of cell-specific factors with which the 
TAD interacts."
8807287,"Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of 
active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying 
mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively. Other factors probably are also 
uniquely involved in transcription-repair coupling. Recently, a defect was 
described in transcription-coupled repair for Escherichia coli mismatch repair 
mutants and human tumor cell lines with mutations in mismatch repair genes. We 
examined removal of UV-induced DNA damage in yeast strains mutated in mismatch 
repair genes in an effort to confirm a defect in transcription-coupled repair in 
this system. In addition, we determined the contribution of the mismatch repair 
gene MSH2 to transcription-coupled repair in the absence of global genomic 
repair using rad7 delta mutants. We also determined whether the 
Rad26-independent transcription-coupled repair observed in rad26 delta and rad7 
delta rad26 delta mutants depends on MSH2 by examining repair deficiencies of 
rad26 delta msh2 delta and rad7 delta rad26 delta msh2 delta mutants. We found 
no defects in transcription-coupled repair caused by mutations in the mismatch 
repair genes MSH2, MLH1, PMS1, and MSH3. Yeast appears to differ from bacteria 
and human cells in the capacity for transcription-coupled repair in a mismatch 
repair mutant background."

(IDS-2 locus) distal to the functional IDS gene has recently been identified. 
This work reports the characterization of IDS gene alterations in two severely 
affected patients. Patient 1 has a partial deletion that removes exons I to VI 
and extends about 200 kb upstream of the IDS gene. Patient 2 has an internal 
deletion of exons IV, V, VI, and VII, which results from an IDS gene-pseudogene 
exchange between highly homologous regions. In the rearranged gene, the junction 
intron contains pseudogene intron 3- and intron 7-related sequences. An 
interchromosomal recombination is probably the cause of this rearranged X 
chromosome."
8808724,"While the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists is clearly justified in patients 
receiving cisplatin, their role with less emetic drugs is still not defined. The 
aim of our randomized study was to verify the efficacy of the single standard 
dose of three 5-HT3-receptor-antagonists in moderately emetic chemotherapies. 
Sixty chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of 30 to 71 years in age, P.S. = 
0-1, receiving 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC 75) q 21 days or 
cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 120 mg/m2 epirubicin or 
high dose mitomycin-methotrexate-mitoxantrone (MMM) q 14 days (+ G-CSF) or 100 
mg/m2 epirubicin (+ G-CSF) were randomized to receive, 15 min before 
chemotherapy, 8 mg i.v. bolus of ondansetron or 3 mg i.v. granisetron or 5 mg 
i.v. tropisetron and no further antiemetic therapy in the following days. 180 
cycles were evaluable. Complete protection, (the absence of vomiting episodes,) 
was respectively 75%, 70% and 70% in the acute and 70%, 82%, 72% in the delayed 
phases, and an absence of nausea was 56%, 37% and 20% in the acute phase and 
50%, 35% and 27% in the delayed, respectively. Complete response, (absence of 
vomiting and absence or mild nausea,) was 74%, 58.6% and 50.8% in the acute and 
64%, 63.7%, 47.3% in the delayed phases, respectively. At the statistical 
analysis no significant differences between the three drugs were found regarding 
acute vomiting while ondansetron was superior to granisetron and tropisetron in 
acute (p = 0.018; p < 0.05) and delayed nausea (P = 0.104; p < 0.01). This 
activity is practically the same as that we reported (Ann Oncol 1994; 6, suppl 
8: 204) with a loading dose on day 1 and maintenance for the following 2-5 days, 
but with a significantly favorable cost-benefit ratio."
8809749,"Some strains of the plant-pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis secrete toxins 
(killer toxins) that are lethal to susceptible strains of the same fungus. There 
are three well-characterized killer toxins in U. maydis-KP1, KP4, and KP6-which 
are secreted by the P1, P4, and P6 subtypes, respectively. These killer toxins 
are small polypeptides encoded by segments of an endogenous, persistent 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus in each U. maydis subtype. In P4 and P6, the 
M2 dsRNA segment encodes the toxin. In this work, the KP1 killer toxin was 
purified for internal amino acid sequence analysis, and P1M2 was identified as 
the KP1 toxin-encoding segment by sequence analysis of cDNA clones. The KP1 
toxin is a monomer with a predicted molecular weight of 13.4kDa and does not 
have extensive sequence similarity with other viral anti-fungal toxins. The P1M2 
segment is different from the P4 and P6 toxin-encoding dsRNA segments in that 
the 3' non-coding region of its plus strand has no sequence homology to the 3' 
ends of the plus strands of P1M1, P4M2, or P6M2."
8812219,"Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as 
an antileukemogenic agent. This study was conducted to assess the subchronic 
toxicity of amsacrine in rats following a cyclic clinical dosing regimen and as 
a range-finding experiment for a subsequent carcinogenicity bioassay. Groups of 
30 male Wistar rats were administered drug intravenously at doses of 0, 0.25, 
1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. This 
cycle of dosing and recovery was repeated six times to simulate human clinical 
usage of the drug. Assessments of hematology, clinical chemistry, and gross and 
microscopic pathology were conducted 3 and 21 days following completion of 
dosing in the first, third, and sixth cycles. There were no deaths during the 
study. Hair loss, diarrhea, tail injuries, chromodacryorrhea, and rhinorrhea 
were observed primarily in animals administered 3 mg/kg. Hair loss and diarrhea 
occurred during periods of dosing and generally resolved during the recovery 
phase of each cycle. Both of these signs became progressively more severe during 
the latter half of the study. Body weight loss and reduced food consumption also 
occurred in the 3 mg/kg group during each week of dosing. At study termination, 
mean body weight and food consumption of the 3 mg/kg group were significantly 
less than those of controls by approximately 20 and 50%, respectively. Marked, 
reversible leukopenia associated with reductions in both neutrophil and 
lymphocyte counts occurred in cycles one and three in animals administered 1 and 
3 mg/kg, respectively. Reversible neutropenia was also observed in the 3 mg/kg 
group in cycle 6. Similar effects on platelet counts were seen in the 3 mg/kg 
group in all three cycles analyzed. Absolute and relative testes weights of the 
3 mg/kg group were significantly less than the vehicle controls at all time 
points in the third and sixth cycles. Relative testes weights were also 
decreased in the 1 mg/kg group in cycle 6. Reversible decreases in absolute 
relative spleen weights occurred in all drug-treated groups in cycle 1 and for 
the 3 mg/kg group in cycle 3. Lymphoid depletion (spleen, thymus, lymph node), 
marked hypocellularity of bone marrow, segmental degeneration of seminiferous 
tubules, and intestinal epithelial cell degeneration were observed at 3 mg/kg. 
With the exception of testicular changes which remained evident at the end of 
cycle 6, pathologic lesions were reversible during the 23-day recovery period of 
each cycle. The results show that the subchronic toxicity of amsacrine is 
consistent with a cytotoxic mechanism and that target organs are generally 
tissues with the highest rates of cell turnover. The doses administered in this 
study induced a range of effects which were minimal at 0.25 mg/kg and 
dose-limiting at 3 mg/kg and therefore were considered appropriate for use in 
the subsequent carcinogenicity bioassay."
8813311,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transvaginal ultrasound measurement of bladder 
wall thickness can be used as a screening test for detrusor instability in women 
with urinary symptoms.
DESIGN: A blinded prospective study.
SETTING: A London teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eight-four symptomatic women presenting to a 
urodynamic clinic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The detection of detrusor instability by means of 
videocystourethrography (VCU) and ambulatory urodynamics in women with a mean 
bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound.
RESULTS: One hundred and eight women had a mean bladder wall thickness of 
greater than 5 mm. Ninety-four percent (102) of these women had detrusor 
instability either when undergoing VCU or ambulatory urodynamics. Seventeen 
women had a bladder wall thickness of less than 3.5 mm of whom three were found 
to have detrusor instability on VCU.
CONCLUSION: The measurement of a mean bladder wall thickness greater than 5 mm 
with transvaginal ultrasound is a sensitive screening method for diagnosing 
detrusor instability in symptomatic women without outflow obstruction."
8816746,"Plasmodium falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria, a disease of 
worldwide importance. Resistance to current drugs such as chloroquine and 
mefloquine is spreading at an alarming rate, and our antimalarial armamentarium 
is almost depleted. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic 
proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its 
hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug 
development. We have determined the crystal structure of recombinant plasmepsin 
II complexed with pepstatin A. This represents the first reported crystal 
structure of a protein from P. falciparum. The crystals contain molecules in two 
different conformations, revealing a remarkable degree of interdomain 
flexibility of the enzyme. The structure was used to design a series of 
selective low molecular weight compounds that inhibit both plasmepsin II and the 
growth of P. falciparum in culture."
8816973,"The processes that lead to the production of islet cell autoantibodies in 
insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are largely unknown. Humoral 
autoimmunity may be the result of an antigen-independent polyclonal B cell 
activation, or a consequence of an antigen driven B cell activation and 
selection for the antigen. We have analysed the gene elements encoding the 
immunoglobulin variable regions of seven human monoclonal islet cell antibodies 
(MICA) 1-7 directed to the major islet autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase 
(GAD65). These autoantibodies were derived from two patients with newly 
diagnosed IDDM. The variable gene regions of the MICA revealed different 
sequences, and no relation between V gene usage and shared epitope recognition 
of the MICA was evident. An elevated usage of VH 1, VH 4 and Vlambda 2 gene 
segments was observed. The underrepresentation of VH 3 family members in the 
MICA discriminated them from most autoantibodies. The high relative avidities 
for GAD65 of MICA 1, 3, 4 and 6 and their high, nonrandom ratio of replacement 
versus silent mutations in the antigen binding regions indicated that the 
humoral response to GAD65 is driven by the antigen. MICA 2, 5 and 7 showed as 
well an excess of replacement mutations in the antigen binding regions, but 
revealed lower relative avidities for their antigen. Since these clones 
accumulated many somatic mutations in their variable gene regions, they may be 
characteristic for later stages of the autoimmune disease. The results suggest 
that, in humans, an antigen driven B cell activation and affinity maturation 
process may contribute to the production of GAD65-autoantibodies found in 
patients with IDDM."
8817329,"The Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a secreted glycoprotein, which 
regulates cell proliferation, acting as a transducer molecule for developmental 
processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. We have isolated 
and characterized cDNA clones from two different human dsh-homologous genes, 
designated as DVL-1 and DVL-3. DVL-1 and DVL-3 putative protein products show 
64% amino acid identity. The DVL-1 product is 50% identical to dsh and 92% to a 
murine dsh homologue (Dvl-1). Both human DVL genes are widely expressed in fetal 
and adult tissues, including brain, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and heart. 
DVL-1 locus maps to chromosome 1p36 and DVL-3 to chromosome 3q27. DVL-1 locus on 
chromosome 1 corresponds to the murine syntenic region where Dvl-1 is located. 
DVL-1 and DVL-3 are members of a human dsh-like gene family, which is probably 
involved in human development. Although the precise role of these genes in 
embryogenesis is only conjectural at present, the structural and evolutionary 
characteristics suggest that mutations at their loci may be involved in neural 
and heart developmental defects."
8819039,"Zieve's syndrome consists of transient haemolytic anaemic, jaundice, 
hyperlipidaemia and alcohol-induced liver disease. It is rare with less than 75 
cases reported in a Medicine literature search from 1966. It can present acutely 
with abdominal pain."
8819627,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is one of the most serious complications of hemophilia 
and is usually treated with extensive surgery. A new treatment approach is 
radiotherapy. Patients with long-bone pseudotumors are usually treated with high 
doses of radiotherapy greater than 1500 cGy. We treated a 13-year-old hemophilic 
boy who had a pseudotumor of the tibia with low-dose radiotherapy (600 cGy). 
There was no complication during the two-and-a-half-year follow-up. Improvement 
of both the clinical and radiological status of the patient was noteworthy. We 
would like to suggest the use of low-dose radiotherapy in patients with 
hemophilic pseudotumors."
8821458,"We demonstrate that the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 alpha is enriched 
in two interneuron cell populations in the dorsal division of the cochlear 
nucleus. Electron microscopic analysis confirms that mGluR1 alpha 
immunoreactivity is concentrated in the dendritic spines of cartwheel cells and 
in dendrites of the recently described unipolar brush cells. The cartwheel 
cells, which have many similarities to the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, 
participate in a local neuronal circuit that modulates the output of the dorsal 
cochlear nucleus. Immunostained unipolar brush cells were observed in granule 
cell regions of the cochlear nucleus and the vestibulocerebellum. The presence 
of analogous cell types with similar patterns of immunolabeling in the 
cerebellum and in the dorsal cochlear nucleus suggests that a shared but as yet 
unknown mode of processing may occur in both structures."
8822090,"The antitumor effect of CGP41251 (4'-N-benzoyl staurosporine), a selective 
protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, was examined on two kinds of human non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (adenocarcinoma: A549 and squamous cell 
carcinoma: NCI-H520). CGP41251 at 0.5 or 1.0 microM inhibited the proliferation 
of these tumor cell lines significantly; However, at 0.1 microM, it did not show 
any significant inhibition. Cell cycle analysis indicated that CGP41251 at 0.5 
or 1.0 microM arrested the cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase up to 24 hr, 
but 0.1 microM did not. It seems that the antiproliferative action of CGP41251 
against human NSCLC is related to G2/M accumulation. In NCI-H520, CGP41251 
caused DNA re-replication without mitosis. In a nude mice xenograft, CGP41251 at 
a dose of 200 mg/kg showed antitumor activity against these cell lines. 
Histopathologically, expansion of central necrosis was observed, although no 
destruction of tumor nests was seen by CGP41251 administration. In both tumor 
tissues, the PKC activity of the particulate fraction was significantly 
decreased by CGP41251 treatment. From these results, it is thought that the 
antitumor activity of CGP41251 against human NSCLS is accompanied by the 
decrease of PKC activity in the particulate fraction. Moreover, the G2/M arrest 
of the cell cycle induced by CGP41251 might be important for the growth 
inhibitory action of this compound."
8824770,"We have analyzed the interference of antitumoral drugs acting through the 
inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II on the human HeLa cell metabolism. Different 
compounds characterized by a diverse mechanism of action have been used, namely 
m-amsacrine, an intercalative drug, etoposide, which does not intercalate DNA, 
and suramin, which exerts its effect through an unknown mechanism. In HeLa cells 
treated with increasing doses of these drugs, we have examined cell viability 
and DNA synthesis capacity, and we have evaluated topoisomerase II activity. 
Cellular morphology and DNA integrity have been studied in order to characterize 
the mechanism of cell death. The results we have obtained clearly indicate that 
topoisomerase II poisons induce cell death by apoptosis. These observations 
suggest a role of the inhibition of topoisomerase II activity in the apoptotic 
program."
8824885,"Although reactive oxygen species have been proposed to play a major role in the 
aging process, the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study we 
investigate the effects of a perturbation in the ratio of Cu/Zn-superoxide 
dismutase activity (Sod1 dismutases .O2-to H2O2) to glutathione peroxidase 
activity (Gpx1 catalyses H2O2 conversion to H2O) on cell growth and development. 
Our data demonstrate that Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an elevation in 
the ratio of Sod1 activity to Gpx1 activity produce higher levels of H2O2 and 
exhibit well characterised markers of cellular senescence viz. slower 
proliferation and altered morphology. On the contrary, Sod1 transfected cell 
lines that have an unaltered ratio in the activity of these two enzymes, have 
unaltered levels of H2O2 and fail to show characteristics of senescence. 
Furthermore, fibroblasts established from individuals with Down syndrome have an 
increase in the ratio of Sod1 to Gpx1 activity compared with corresponding 
controls and senesce earlier. Interestingly, cells treated with H2O2 also show 
features of senescence and/or senesce earlier. We also show that Cip1 mRNA 
levels are elevated in Down syndrome cells, Sod1 transfectants with an altered 
Sod1 to Gpx1 activity ratio and those treated with H2O2, thus suggesting that 
the slow proliferation may be mediated by Cip1. Furthermore, our data 
demonstrate that Cip1 mRNA levels are induced by exposure of cells to H2O2. 
These data give valuable insight into possible molecular mechanisms that 
contribute tribute to cellular senescence and may be useful in the evolution of 
therapeutic strategies for aging."
8825048,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease 
with a high mutation rate. It is clinically a very variable disorder and 
hamartomas can occur in many different organs. TSC shows genetic heterogeneity; 
one gene, TSC1, is on chromosome 9q34, and the second gene, TSC2, on chromosome 
16p13.3. Clinical criteria for diagnosis have been established, but diagnosis of 
patients with minimal expression of the disease can be very difficult. In 
children the phenotype is often incomplete or not fully assessable. Hence mildly 
affected subjects, at risk for severely affected offspring, may remain 
undiagnosed. The detection of (small) mutations in the tuberous sclerosis gene 
located on chromosome 16 (TSC2) has recently become possible and may be helpful 
in the diagnosis of ambiguous cases. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
of a point mutation in the TSC2 gene in a familial case of tuberous sclerosis. A 
nonsense mutation was detected in a family in which the father had only minor 
signs hinting at tuberous sclerosis. The son had multiple cardiac tumours and 
white patches, but full clinical investigation was impossible in this child. 
This case illustrates that mutation analysis can contribute to a diagnosis of 
tuberous sclerosis in families with an incomplete phenotype."
8825494,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disorder in the Caucasian population. 
The gene was identified in 1989 on the basis of its map location on chromosome 
7. The encoded gene product, named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR), corresponds to a cAMP-regulated chloride channel found almost 
exclusively in the secretory epithelial cells. Although the major mutation that 
results in a single amino acid deletion (F508) accounts for 70% of the disease 
alleles, more than 550 additional mutant alleles of different forms have been 
detected. Many of these mutations can be divided into five general classes in 
terms of their demonstrated or presumed molecular consequences. In addition, a 
good correlation has been found between CFTR genotype and one of the clinical 
variables--pancreatic function status. An unexpected finding, however, is the 
documentation of CFTR mutations in patients with atypical CF disease 
presentations, including congenital absence of vas deferens and several 
pulmonary diseases. Thus, the implication of CFTR mutation is more profound than 
CF alone."
8827557,"Conventional strabismus surgery employs a conjunctival incision to gain access 
to Tenon's space where a wide variety of procedures are routinely performed on 
the tendon and anterior aspect of the extraocular muscles. Recently, transnasal 
endoscopic surgical techniques have gained acceptance as effective means of 
decompressing the medial wall and floor of the orbit in patients with 
thyroid-related orbitopathy. The orbital surface of the medial rectus and 
inferior rectus are exposed from the annulus of Zinn to a position close to 
where the muscles penetrate Tenon's capsule. In theory, this technique also 
provides the exposure necessary to locate and retrieve a ""lost"" medial rectus 
when the usual sub-Tenon's approach fails to recover the muscle. Cadaver studies 
demonstrate the feasibility of exposure and suture placement in the stump of a 
lost medial rectus with passage of the suture through Tenon's capsule to 
transmit the force of the muscle to the globe, provided that the lost muscle is 
retrieved before severe contracture develops."
8828040,"As part of an effort to identify the gene responsible for the predominant form 
of polycystic kidney disease (PKD1), we used a gridded human P1 library for 
contig assembly. The interval of interest, a 700-kb segment on chromosome 
16p13.3, can be physically delineated by the genetic markers D16S125 and D16S84 
and chromosomally characterized as a GC-rich isochore enriched for CpG islands, 
genes, and Alu-like repeats. Our attempts to recover CEPH YACs that encode this 
region of chromosome 16 were unsuccessful. However, we screened an arrayed P1 
library using 15 distinct probes from the D16S125-D16S84 interval and identified 
56 independent P1 clones. Only one probe from the interval was unsuccessful in 
identifying a P1 clone. Forty-four P1 clones were determined to be unique based 
on restriction enzyme analysis, and 42 of these were found to originate from 
chromosome 16p13.3, based on FISH to metaphase chromosomes. The 700-kb interval 
could be defined by a single sequence-ready contig comprised of 12 P1 clones and 
1 cosmid clone. Our studies support the use of multiple libraries to generate 
the requisite physical reagents for positional cloning and encourage the use of 
Escherichia coli-based large-insert cloning systems to recover clones from 
YAC-deficient chromosomal intervals."
8830082,"We report two observations of antenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome. This 
uncommon genetic disorder suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance, but almost 
all cases described are sporadic; the responsible gene is yet not located. 
Ultrasonographic detection is difficult, based on the following signs: 
brachycephalic skull (unusually detected), flat facial profile with a nasal 
bridge depression, tall appearance of the forehead (inconstant), total bilateral 
and symmetrical syndactylies of the hands and feet. At last we present our 
arguments for medical abortion, when this disorder is detected."
8834412,"Research into the psychobiology of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD) finds 
alterations in markers associated with serotonergic neurotransmission. 
Supporting this is work showing that patients with PDD respond to some agents 
that block the reuptake of serotonin. In this open trial, patients were treated 
for one cycle with placebo and then for three consecutive cycles with the 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. The study population was composed of 14 
participants who met DSM-IV criteria for PDD with moderate to severe 
symptomatology and specifically endorsed anger and irritability as a central 
premenstrual complaint. Patients showed modest improvement over the course of 
the pretreatment evaluation, with significant improvement occurring for feelings 
of worthlessness, decreased interest, and low energy. The effects of active 
treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 
8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in 
the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001). A group of items 
from daily ratings indicative of anger and irritability (mood swings, anger and 
irritability, behavioral dyscontrol, and interpersonal conflicts) also showed 
improvement (F[1,13] = 5.94; p < 0.03). Various definitions of response were 
applied to treatment completers. The most conservative measure, the Clinical 
Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response 
(CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3). These open 
trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in 
the acute phase for the treatment of PDD."
8834474,"The urodele amphibians are nearly the only adult vertebrates able to regenerate 
their missing or amputated tail. The most striking feature of this model lies in 
the ability of the spinal cord (SC) to differentiate, within the regenerating 
tail, a new ependymal tube from which the SC and the peripheral nervous system 
originate. A fundamental question is whether, in response to tail excision, the 
ependymoglia of the old SC stump behaves as an embryonic neuroepithelium. To 
evaluate this possibility, cell lines from primary cell cultures of adult SC 
were established for the first time in newts, and two cell clones, 
immunochemically characterized as ependymoglial cell populations, could be 
obtained. To analyze the potentialities of these clonal cells, after 
transplantation in tail regenerates, cell-marking experiments, using either in 
vitro transfection with lacZ gene or the lineage tracer lysinated rhodamine 
dextran (LRD), were performed. One to 2 weeks postimplantation, most of labeled 
derivatives were identified as melanocytes. Interestingly, labeled cells were 
also seen integrated in the ependymoglia of the regenerating SC. Two to 6 weeks 
after implantation in young regenerates, we also observed LRD-labeled elongated 
cells close to nerves or myofibers which were unambiguously identified as 
Schwann cells by galactocerebroside staining. Taken together, these findings 
showed that clonal cells derived from adult newt SC cultures could largely find, 
in regenerate mesenchyme, suitable environmental conditions to differentiate 
into melanocytes or Schwann cells. Because these two cells types arise from 
neural crest cells during embryo-genesis, this supports the interesting view 
that multipotent cells are still present in the SC of adult urodeles."
8835601,"A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was 
diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
chromosomal analysis. The association of WS and chronic renal failure (CRF) is 
only rarely encountered. Endocrinological examinations revealed 
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of 
adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin 
releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted. While most of the endocrinological 
abnormalities observed in this patient could be attributed to altered endocrine 
circumstances in CRF, some findings stand in contrast. Furthermore, the 
testicular biopsy specimen showed severe hypospermatogenesis. Endocrine 
disorders observed in this patient may be at least in part, responsible for 
various clinical features underlying WS."
8836582,"Rat pups suspended in air and administered L-DOPA engage in a locomotor behavior 
termed air-stepping. The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering 
several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, 
prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats. NSD 1015 dose-dependently increased 
the latency to onset and decreased the duration of L-DOPA-induced air-stepping. 
Thus L-DOPA induces air-stepping only after its conversion to dopamine and/or 
noradrenaline."
8837815,"Previous work has demonstrated the importance of protein kinase C in regulating 
glioma cell proliferation in vitro. Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when 
administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the 
treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. The patient in the present study 
harbored a left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma adjacent to Broca's area and the 
paracentral region, which limited gross resection. After a subtotal resection of 
the tumor and after radiation, the patient was administered high-dose tamoxifen 
therapy for gross residual gadolinium-enhancing regions that were revealed by 
magnetic resonance imaging and by high glucose uptake as demonstrated by 
positron emission tomography. After treatment, a decrease in gadolinium 
enhancement on magnetic resonance images and a decrease in glucose uptake 
revealed by positron emission tomography were noted. A laboratory examination of 
the tissue obtained from the original surgical resection revealed resistance to 
radiation therapy but sensitivity to tamoxifen as measured by 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The 
subsequent in vitro testing of the tumor that was removed after the recurrence 
of tumor (22 months after the initiation of tamoxifen) revealed loss of 
sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, the recurrent tumor remained sensitive to 
growth inhibition by the potent protein kinase C inhibitor, hypericin, despite 
loss of sensitivity to tamoxifen in vitro, suggesting the potential clinical 
application of this agent. This close in vitro correlation with the clinical 
course of the patient in the present study suggests a potential role for such in 
vitro radiation and chemosensitivity testing in designing a rational 
individualized clinical course of treatment."
8841521,"The presence of elastic fibres in the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides 
physiologically important elastic properties for many tissues. Until recently, 
microfibrils, one component of the ECM, were thought primarily to serve as a 
scaffolding on which elastin is deposited during development to form elaunin 
fibres [1]. The most prominent protein that forms mammalian microfibrils is 
fibrillin. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous 
connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on 
mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be 
useful. Microfibrils are also found in the ECM of some invertebrate tissues, and 
there is growing evidence that the protein forming the structure is homologous 
to mammalian fibrillin [3,4]. It has been shown that the microfibril-based 
arterial wall of the lobster has viscoelastic properties [5], and we have now 
utilized this primitive artery to measure the modulus of elasticity of 
microfibrils. It is similar to that of the rubber-like protein elastin."
8842735,"We have identified a region with characteristics of a paternal-specific 
methylation imprint at the human H19 locus. This region, extending from -2.0 kb 
upstream to the start of transcription, is heavily methylated in sperm and on 
the paternal allele in somatic cells. This methylation was preserved during 
pre-implantation. Structural analysis revealed the presence of CpG islands and a 
large direct repeat with a 400 bp sequence reiterated several times, but no 
significant sequence homology to the corresponding region of the mouse H19 gene. 
These findings could suggest a role for secondary DNA structure in genomic 
imprinting across the species, and they also present a puzzling aspect of the 
evolution of the H19 regulatory region in human and mouse."
8844144,"The SPT4, SPT5, and SPT6 gene products define a class of transcriptional 
repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought to function through 
their effects on chromatin assembly or stability. Mutations in these genes 
confer a similar range of phenotypes to mutations in HIR genes, which encode 
transcriptional repressors that regulate expression of many of the core histone 
genes. Here we show that mutations in the three SPT genes also affect 
transcription of the histone genes that reside at the HTA1-HTB1 locus. HTA1-lacZ 
transcription was reduced in each spt mutant background, an effect that required 
a negative site in the HTA1 promoter. The transcriptional effect could be 
reversed by the overproduction of histones H2A and H2B in an spt4 mutant and 
histones H3 and H4 in all three spt mutants. Suppression of the spt4 
transcriptional defect was dependent on the overproduction of both histones H2A 
and H2B, and required the presence of N-terminal amino acids in both histones. 
The results are consistent with the idea that the effects of the spt mutations 
on nucleosome assembly and/or stability activate repressors of HTA1 
transcription."
8844397,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a multifunctional protein whose main duty is to 
preserve the integrity of the genome. This function of wild-type p53 as 
""guardian of the genome"" is achieved at different levels, as a cell cycle 
checkpoint protein, halting the cell cycle upon DNA damage, and via a direct 
involvement in processes of DNA repair. Alternatively, p53 can induce apoptosis. 
Mutations in the p53 gene occur in about 50% of all human tumors and eliminate 
the tumor suppressor functions of p53. However, many mutant p53 proteins have 
not simply lost tumor suppressor functions but have gained oncogenic properties 
which contribute to the progression of tumor cells to a more malignant 
phenotype. The molecular basis for this gain of function of mutant p53 is still 
unknown. However, mutant (mut) p53 specifically binds to nuclear matrix 
attachment region (MAR) DNA elements. MAR elements constitute important higher 
order regulatory elements of chromatin structure and function. By binding to 
these elements, mut p53 could modulate important cellular processes, like gene 
expression, replication, and recombination, resulting in phenotypic alterations 
of the tumor cells. Mut p53 thus could be the first representative of a new 
class of oncogenes, which exert their functions via long-range alterations or 
perturbation of chromatin structure and function."
8845843,"CpG dinucleotides provide hotspots for transitional mutations in a variety of 
genes, some leading to genetic diseases in humans. Although this phenomenon is 
attributed to cytosine methylation at such sites, direct and specific 
observations of CpG methylation at the sites of recurrent mutations are lacking. 
We have used a bisulfite genomic sequencing method to analyze DNA methylation 
within three representative exons from the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, 
well recognized for its high frequency of spontaneous mutations. We observed 
that the cytosine methylation within NF1 exons 28, 29, and 31 is restricted to 
CpG dinucleotides, including the CpG dinucleotide present at the site of the 
recurrent NF1 mutation (C5839T; also referred to as R1947X). At several sites, 
clone-specific methylation differences were also observed. Our results provide 
experimental evidence for the hypothesis that methylatable CpGs in the NF1 gene 
contribute to spontaneous germline mutations associated with this gene, by 
showing that DNA methylation does occur at all CpGs contained within these 
representative NF1 exons. As well, the DNA methylation seen at the common 
mutation site in exon 31 may explain why this site is frequently mutated. 
Methylation-dependent mutagenesis may also provide a basis for some somatic 
(second hit) mutations which disable the normal allele and result in the 
development of NF1 associated symptoms."
8850036,"BACKGROUND: Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) causes molluscum contagiosum (MC) 
in both children and adults. Recent studies have revealed that the DNA of MCV 
can be classified into two major types by restriction enzyme cleavage patterns; 
however, the relationship between MCV types and the clinical features has not 
been fully understood. Our study was conducted to examine whether there are 
geographic differences in the incidence of MCV types and whether a correlation 
exists between MCV types and the age, sex, and clinical status of the patients.
METHODS: Specimens were obtained from 171 Japanese patients. The total DNA was 
extracted and digested with the restriction enzymes, BamH I, Hind III, and Cla 
I, respectively. Specimens were then electrophoresed in agarose gels. The gels 
were stained with ethidium bromide and photographs were taken under 
transillumination.
RESULTS: Six different cleavage patterns were observed; they were classified 
into two major types, MCV 1 and MCV 2, consisting of two MCV 1-variants, and MCV 
2 prototype, and three MCV 2-variants. The ratio of MCV 1 to MCV 2 was 13:1. MCV 
1 was commonly detected in children (98%) and adult women (92%). MCV 2 was more 
frequently isolated from adult men (44%) and from patients with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (75%).
CONCLUSION: MCV types found in Japanese children and adult women were 
predominantly MCV 1 and less frequently MCV 2. This pattern is similar to that 
observed in European countries and Australia, suggesting a high frequency and 
world-wide distribution of MCV 1. The higher incidence of MCV 2 among adult men 
and HIV-positive patients may indicate that transmission routes of MCV 1 and MCV 
2 is somewhat different, of which the latter may be in part by sexual contact."
8850274,"Data from a large, population-based case-control study were analyzed to 
investigate the relationship between prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke and 
childhood brain tumors (CBTs). A total of 540 CBT patients, diagnosed between 
1984 and 1991, were identified from population-based tumor registries in 19 West 
Coast counties that included Seattle, WA (13 counties), San Francisco, CA (5 
counties), and Los Angeles, CA (1 county). Random digit dial was used to select 
801 control subjects from the three geographical regions to obtain a 
case:control ratio of 1:2 in San Francisco and Seattle and 1:1 in Los Angeles. 
The data first were analyzed separately by geographical site and then were 
combined with adjustments made for gender, age at the time of diagnosis (or 
reference date of control subjects), birth year of the index child, and maternal 
race. No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal 
smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal 
smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
0.72-1.3]. A slightly increased OR for CBTs was found for paternal smoking 
during pregnancy in the absence of maternal smoking (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 
0.90-1.5) and for maternal exposure to passive smoke from any source (OR = 1.2; 
95% CI = 0.95-1.6). The results of this analysis are consistent with results 
from several prior epidemiological studies that showed no significant 
association between CBTs and maternal smoking before or during pregnancy or 
maternal exposure to passive smoke during pregnancy."
8851475,"BACKGROUND: The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive inherited disease 
caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine 
phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) activity. Many different mutations throughout 
the HPRT coding region of Lesch-Nyhan patients have been described, including 
single base substitutions, partial or entire gene deletions, gene insertions or 
endoduplication of exons. However, study of gene mutation in Chinese patients 
has rarely been reported in Taiwan.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis were 
used to identify the location and the nature of the mutation at the HPRT locus 
in two brothers affected with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The HPRT cDNA, amplified 
from total RNA of patient's peripheral blood by reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction, was cloned into a pGEM-3Zf(-) vector and then sequenced. Family 
study involved initial screening using single-strand conformation polymorphism, 
and further confirmation by direct sequencing of the exon encompassing the 
mutation.
RESULTS: The mutation identified in these two affected siblings was a single 
nucleotide substitution, from cytosine to guanine, in exon 3 of the HPRT coding 
region. This transversion putatively caused a single amino acid substitution 
from phenylalanine to leucine at codon 74 in the translated protein. This base 
change was further confirmed by direct sequencing of both the HPRT cDNA fragment 
and the exon 3 of HPRT gene amplified from genomic DNA. The family study 
revealed that the patient's mother was a heterozygous carrier, and the mutation 
seemed to have occurred de novo in a germinal cell from one of the maternal 
grandparents.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first family study on Chinese patients with Lesch-Nyhan 
syndrome identified by molecular analysis in Taiwan. The mutation described 
herein is a novel substitution which occurs in a suggested ""hotspot"" of mutation 
(exon 3) of the HPRT gene. The application of molecular analysis of HPRT-gene 
allows not only DNA diagnosis by directly detecting the mutant alleles, but also 
prenatal diagnosis and carrier identification within individual families 
affected by Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."
8851953,"We investigated the distribution of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus) on and around six patients with MRSA infection in our neurosurgical 
ward. All patients had a disturbance of consciousness and had sputum 
colonization of MRSA. Samples were obtained from 11 sites (patients' hands, 
attendances' hands, floors, sidetables, bedclothes, chairs, walls, curtains, 
door knobs, faucets and disposable gloves) in the patients' rooms by the wiping 
method. High counts of MRSA were detected on horizontal planes such as floors, 
sidetables and chairs, but MRSA was not detected on vertical planes such as 
curtains and walls. The reason why MRSA was detected on the horizontal planes 
was due to a fall of MRSA spread from sputum in the air. These findings indicate 
that the disinfection of horizontal planes is important for preventing the 
spread of MRSA. We also evaluated what disinfectant was useful for floor 
disinfection and concluded that 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate (Hibitane) and 
0.5% benzalkonium chloride (Osvan) were more effective than the other 
usually-used disinfectants such as alkyldiaminoethyl glycine (Tego-51)."
8851988,"The amniotic band syndrome is a collection of congenital deformities presumably 
due to rupture of amniotic sac. It appears to cause fetal injury through three 
basic mechanisms including malformation, disruption, and deformation. The 
associated anomalies vary from minor digital defect to major craniofacial and 
visceral defects. They can be categorized as neural tube-like defects, 
craniofacial anomalies, limb anomalies, abdominal and thoracic wall defects, 
visceral anomalies, and constriction bands. We present two autopsy cases and 
discuss the diagnostic features. Our findings support Torpin's theory that the 
fibrous constriction bands generated from early rupture of the amnion. An 
accurate diagnosis may be achieved by looking for the major features of amniotic 
band syndrome and a routine chromosome study and placental examination in cases 
with multiple congenital deformities."
8852660,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a frequent congenital 
malformation regarded as a multigenic neurocristopathy. Two susceptibility genes 
have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene and the 
endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene. Hitherto however, homozygosity for EDNRB 
mutations accounted for the HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. Here, we 
report heterozygous EDNRB missense mutations (G57S, R319W and P383L) in isolated 
HSCR. These data might suggest that EDNRB mutations could be dosage sensitive: 
heterozygosity would predispose to isolated HSCR with incomplete penetrance, 
while homozygosity would result in more complex neurocristopathies associating 
HSCR and WS features. In addition, the present data give further support to the 
role of the endothelin-signalling pathway in the development of neural 
crest-derived enteric neurons."
8853221,"This study investigated the behavioural and anticonvulsant effects of 
voltage-sensitive calcium channel blockers in DBA/2 mice. Omega-Conotoxin MVIIC 
(0.1, 0.3 micrograms ICV/mouse) and omega-agatoxin IVA (0.1, 0.3, 1 micrograms 
ICV), which act predominantly at P- and/or Q-type calcium channels, prevented 
clonic and tonic sound-induced seizures in this animal model of reflex epilepsy 
(ED50 values with 95% confidence limits for protection against clonic 
sound-induced seizures were 0.09 (0.04-0.36) micrograms ICV and 0.09 (0.05-0.15) 
micrograms ICV respectively and against tonic seizures 0.07 (0.03-0.16) 
micrograms ICV and 0.08 (0.04-0.13) micrograms ICV, respectively). The N-type 
calcium channel antagonists omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-conotoxin MVIIA were 
also tested in this model. Omega-Conotoxin GVIA was anticonvulsant in DBA/2 
mice, but only at high doses (3 micrograms ICV prevented tonic seizures in 60% 
of the animals; 10 micrograms ICV prevented clonic seizures in 60% and tonic 
seizures in 90% of the animals), whereas omega-conotoxin MVIIA did not inhibit 
sound-induced seizures in doses up to 10 micrograms ICV. Both omega-conotoxin 
GVIA and omega-conotoxin MVIIA induced an intense shaking syndrome in doses as 
low as 0.1 microgram ICV, whereas omega-conotoxin MVIIC and omega-agatoxin IVA 
did not produce shaking at any of the doses examined. Finally, omega-conotoxin 
GI (0.01-1 microgram ICV) and alpha-conotoxin SI (0.3-30 micrograms ICV), which 
both act at acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, were not anticonvulsant and did 
not induce shaking in DBA/2 mice. These results confirm that blockers of N- and 
P-/Q-type calcium channels produce different behavioural responses in animals. 
The anticonvulsant effects of omega-conotoxin MVIIC and omega-agatoxin IVA in 
DBA/2 mice are consistent with reports that P- and/or Q-type calcium channel 
blockers inhibit the release of excitatory amino acids and are worthy of further 
exploration."
8853382,"The effects of endopeptidase inhibition and right atrial appendectomy (AA) on 
plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (irANP) concentrations and 
extravascular accumulation of 131I-labeled bovine serum albumin (CBSA) during 
volume expansion (VE) were examined in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rats (n 
= 5 per group). Compared with controls, infusion of isoncotic albumin (30 ml/kg) 
increased central venous pressure (CVP) by 5.5 mmHg, plasma irANP by 7-fold, and 
CBSA in multiple tissues by 1.6- to 4-fold (P < or = 0.05). Inhibition of ANP 
metabolism with thiorphan (40 mg/kg) had no effect in control animals but 
increased plasma irANP (+118%) and CBSA (+30-100%) compared with VE alone (P < 
or = 0.05). Likewise, interference with ANP release by AA reduced plasma irANP 
(-80%) and CBSA (-30 to -80%) response to VE in parallel (P < or = 0.05). The 
peak increase in CVP during VE was not affected by either of these 
manipulations. It is concluded that endogenous ANP increases plasma protein 
extravasation independent of volume and pressure disturbances during acute 
intravascular expansion."
8855341,"Certain forms of myotonia, a condition characterized by delayed relaxation of 
muscle secondary to sarcolemmal hyperexcitability, are caused by diminished 
chloride conductance in the muscle cell membrane. We have investigated the 
molecular basis for decreased muscle chloride conductance in the myotonic goat, 
an historically important animal model for the elucidation of the role of 
chloride in muscle excitation. A single nucleotide change causing the 
substitution of proline for a conserved alanine residue in the carboxyl terminus 
of the goat muscle chloride channel (gCIC-1) was discovered. Heterologous 
expression of the mutation demonstrated a substantial (+47 mV) shift in the 
midpoint of steady-state activation of the channel, resulting in a diminished 
channel open probability at voltages near the resting membrane potential of 
skeletal muscle. These results provide a molecular basis for the decreased 
chloride conductance in myotonic muscle."
8855950,"DNA sequences containing homopurine d(G1-3A)n tracts are known to be capable of 
adopting non-B-DNA conformations. The structural polymorphism of these sequences 
is a direct consequence of the structural properties of the homopurine d(G1-3A)n 
tracts. Depending on the conditions, d(GA)n DNA sequences can form 
antiparallel-and parallel-stranded homoduplexes, multistranded complexes, and 
ordered single-stranded conformations. On the other hand, much less is known 
about the structural properties of d(GGA)n and d(GGGA)n sequences. In this 
paper, we show that d(GGA)n and d(GGGA)n repeats form antiparallel-stranded, 
intramolecular hairpins. Under physiological salt and pH conditions, the thermal 
stability of these hairpin forms is high, showing, at 50 mM NaCl, melting 
temperatures in the range of 40-50 degrees C. The base-pairing interactions 
involved in the formation of the d(GGA)n and d(GGGA)n hairpins are different. 
G.A pairs importantly contribute to the stability of the d(GGA)n hairpins. On 
the other hand, the d(GGGA)n hairpins are stabilized by the formation of G.G and 
A.A, but not G.A pairs. Homopurine d(G1-3A)n tracts are frequently found at 
genomic locations performing specialized chromosomal functions (i.e. telomeres, 
centromeres, and recombination ""hot-spots""). The molecular interactions 
described here are relevant for the understanding of the peculiar structural and 
biological properties of DNA sequences containing homopurine tracts."
8856345,"The Wnt family of proto-oncogenes encodes secreted signaling proteins that are 
required for mouse development. The Drosophila Wnt homolog, the wingless (Wg) 
segment polarity gene, mediates a signal transduction pathway in which the 
downstream elements appear to be conserved through evolution. One such element, 
the dishevelled gene product, becomes hyperphosphorylated and translocates to 
the plasma membrane in response to Wg (Yanagawa et al., 1995). We report here 
that the mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) and Dishevelled-2 genes encode proteins 
that are differentially localized in Wnt-overexpressing PC12 cell lines 
(PC12/Wnt). Whereas Dvl-1 and Dvl-2 proteins are limited to the soluble fraction 
of parental PC12 cells, PC12/Wnt cells display a subset of Dvl-1 protein 
associated with the membrane and Dvl-2 protein with the cytoskeletal fraction. 
These results suggest a conserved role for Dvl in Wnt/wg signal transduction."
8859913,"Injuries from piercing or cutting instruments or objects are commonly seen in 
the pediatric emergency department. In this study, we present the epidemiology 
of piercing injuries resulting in hospitalization. Medical records for a 
one-year period with E-codes 920.0-920.9 were reviewed for victim-related 
demographic data, anatomic injury location, vehicle of injury, treatment, and 
hospital charges. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was used to ascertain 
injury severity. The most common vehicles of injury were glass (n = 24, 34%), 
nails (n = 11, 16%), and needles (n = 10, 14%). The median AIS score was 
significantly higher for hand injuries compared to the sample median AIS. 
Piercing injuries from consumer-related products were associated with the 
highest AIS scores (median = 2.5). Although the mean AIS for all injuries was 
only 1.5, these injuries resulted in significant costs, with a mean 
hospitalization charge of $3884 +/- 3528. Surgical procedures under general 
anesthesia were required in 81% of the patients."
8861162,"One of the more often used measures of multiple injuries is the injury severity 
score (ISS). Determination of the ISS is based on the abbreviated injury scale 
(AIS). This paper suggests a new algorithm to sort the AISs for each case and 
calculate ISS. The program uses unsorted abbreviated injury scale (AIS) levels 
for each case and rearranges them in descending order. The first three sorted 
AISs representing the three most severe injuries of a person are then used to 
calculate injury severity score (ISS). This algorithm should be useful for 
analyses of clusters of injuries especially when more patients have multiple 
injuries."
8862623,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the 
embryonic forebrain. It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can 
range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely 
unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case 
series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in 
case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted 
population-based studies. Using data from a population-based birth defects 
registry in California, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical 
characteristics of cytogenetically and phenotypically distinct types of 
holoprosencephaly. A total of 121 cases was identified among a cohort of 
1,035,386 live births and fetal deaths. The prevalence of holoprosencephaly was 
1.2 per 10,000 births (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.4 per 10,000). Of all 
cases, 41% (50/121) had a chromosomal abnormality, most commonly Trisomy 13. 
Among the 71 cytogenetically apparently normal cases, 18 had recognizable 
syndromes and the remaining 53 were of unknown cause. Among the cytogenetically 
abnormal cases, females had a greater risk than males (odds ratio = 2.3,95% 
confidence interval [1.2, 4.4]). Among the cytogenetically normal cases, 
increased risks were observed among Hispanic whites (OR = 1.8 [0.9, 3.6]) and 
cases whose mother was born in Mexico (OR = 2.2 [1.0, 4.5]). Approximately 46% 
of all cases had alobar holoprosencephaly, the most severe form of the forebrain 
malformation. The facial phenotype did not strongly predict the severity of the 
brain defect; however, severity was inversely correlated with length of 
survival. This study is the first to present findings based on such a large 
population-based series of infants/fetuses affected by holoprosencephaly, and 
demonstrates the importance of investigating the component subgroups of this 
rare phenotype."
8864644,"In order to determine if cardiac membrane Ca(2+)-transport activities are 
altered in chronic diabetes induced by alloxan, rats were given an intravenous 
injection of 65 mg/kg and the hearts were used 8 weeks later. Some 4 weeks, 
diabetic animals were injected with insulin (3 U/day) for 4 weeks. Both 
sarcolemmal (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes were isolated from 
the ventricular tissue and their Ca(2+)-transporting activities were determined. 
SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated 
ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR 
ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased 
in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR 
Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with 
insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view 
that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the 
occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic 
cardiomyopathy."
8864960,"Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease (WD) are both 
autosomal recessive disorders associated with reduced activity and genetic 
defects of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The strikingly more severe course of WD 
is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no residual enzymatic activity. 
Mutations at the exon 8/intron 8 transition of the LAL gene have been identified 
in several CESD and WD patients and are responsible for the manifestation of the 
disease. We have determined the genetic defect in a 3-month-old boy of African 
origin affected by WD. No enzymatic activity of the lysosomal acid lipase was 
detectable in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of his LAL 
cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that he was homozygous for a mutation at position 
-3 of the exon 8 splice donor site. A C-->T transition leads to a nonsense codon 
and to a premature termination of the LAL protein at amino acid 277. Due to this 
mutation, a shorter LAL mRNA species was also generated that lacked exon 8 and 
was deficient of the nonsense codon. As a consequence, the protein synthesis 
proceeded to the natural termination codon, but the enzyme generated had an 
internal deletion of 24 amino acids (254-277) and was also inactive. These 
findings, together with our previous observations when analyzing the mutations 
in WD and CESD patients lead to the conclusion that the more severe WD is due to 
mutations that absolutely abolish lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity 
and the cholesteryl ester storage disease phenotype is due to mutations that 
allow some residual LAL activity to be manifested."
8865500,"Osteosarcomas arising in irradiated tissues are uncommon but important 
complications of radiotherapy. Radiation-induced osteosarcomas generally occur 
3-30 years after exposure and are most common after radiotherapy for cervical or 
breast carcinoma. These tumors are usually rapidly growing, extremely painful, 
and histologically high grade. In this paper, we report two cases of high-grade 
post-radiation osteosarcoma of the scapula. Despite being almost identical 
radiologically and pathologically, one case had a typical clinical presentation 
whereas the second case had two unusual features, being non-painful and arising 
in a field initially irradiated for bronchogenic carcinoma."
8867791,"The mouse Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid nuclear protein homologous to the 
amino-terminal domain of the product of the groucho (gro) gene of the Drosophila 
Enhancer of split complex. Recent work has suggested that the gro protein 
functions as a transcriptional corepressor during Drosophila development. We 
therefore examined possible roles of the mouse Grg protein in DNA binding and in 
vitro transcription. No sequence-specific DNA binding activity was detected by 
polymerase chain reaction-DNA binding site selection nor was the glutamine-rich 
Grg protein capable of acting as an activation domain in an in vivo 
transactivation assay. However, depletion of Grg protein from HeLa nuclear 
extracts inhibited the in vitro transcription activity of the extracts. We 
suggest that Grg protein may interact with components of the basal transcription 
machinery."
8869105,"In animal models, isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) containing sequences encoded by one 
or several of ten different exons (v1-v10) contribute to tumour metastasis. In 
certain human cancers, CD44v6 expression is associated with poor prognosis. This 
paper examines CD44v expression in skin carcinogenesis and skin cancer 
metastasis. CD44v expression was studied in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC), primary malignant melanoma (PMM), metastases of MM (MMM), 
benign melanocytic naevi (BMN) and normal skin (NS) by immunohistochemistry and 
reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). BCC, SCC and NS expressed 
several CD44v, including v6, albeit in different distributions and intensities. 
PMM, MMM and BMN expressed isoforms containing v7/8 and v10, but failed to 
express epitopes encoded by v5 or v6. Thus, different CD44 isoforms are found in 
human skin cancers and are modulated during carcinogenesis. However, we did not 
observe a correlation of CD44v6 expression with metastatic potential."
8914439,"Since impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a major risk factor for 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), some kinds of intervention 
aiming to prevent or to delay the onset of NIDDM in subjects with IGT might be 
considered. Besides life style modification, drug therapy which could correct 
insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, might prevent progression to NIDDM. 
One agent is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which delays the absorption of 
glucose from the intestine. The resulting decrease in postprandial hyperglycemia 
and hyperinsulinemia could theoretically decrease insulin resistance in IGT 
subjects and, it is hoped, prevent or delay progression to NIDDM. Metformin, an 
antihyperglycemic drug of the biguanide class, may be effective in subjects with 
IGT by reducing hepatic glucose output, enhancing insulin sensitivity, or 
through other mechanisms such as weight loss. New insulin sensitizers, such as 
troglitazone and pioglitazone, improve insulin-mediated glucose disposal by 
enhancing tissue sensitivity to the actions of insulin and reversing the insulin 
resistance, characteristic of NIDDM. Sulfonylureas might be another candidates 
of drug intervention to IGT whose insulin secretory abilities are markedly 
reduced. As far as the question, ""Can NIDDM be prevented or delayed?"" is 
concerned, a prospective study using life style modification or above-mentioned 
drugs, should be performed on long-term basis."
8914512,"We have isolated clones of an Arabidopsis gene (ROF1, for rotamase FKBP) 
encoding a high molecular weight member of the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) 
family. The deduced amino acid sequence of ROF1 predicts a 551-amino acid, 62 
kDa polypeptide which is 44% identical to human FKBP59 - a 59 kDa FKBP which 
binds to the 90 kDa heat shock protein and is associated with inactive steroid 
hormone receptors. ROF1 contains three FKBP12-like domains in the N-terminal 
portion of the protein (in contrast to two domains in mammalian FKBP59), an 
internal repeat structure associated with protein-protein interactions 
(tetratricopeptide repeats), and a putative calmodulin binding domain near the 
C-terminal region of the protein. No sequences associated with protein 
translocation out of the cytosol were found in ROF1. ROF1 mRNA was found at 
equivalent low levels in light-grown roots, stems, and flowers and at slightly 
higher levels in leaves. The abundance of ROF1 mRNA increased several-fold under 
stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to elevated NaCl levels."
8914744,"Weill-Marchesani syndrome comprises short stature, brachydactyly,

individuals in 3 generations demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance of

connective tissue disorder in these families suggests that fibrillin-1 and 
microfibril-associated protein 1, which both map to 15q21.1, are candidate genes 
for Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Immunohistochemistry staining of skin sections 
from family 1 showed an apparent decrease in fibrillin staining compared to 
control individuals."
8917593,"Immune cells invading the central nervous system (CNS) in response to Borna 
disease virus (BDV) antigens are central to the pathogenesis of Borna disease 
(BD). We speculate that the response of the resident cells of the brain to 
infection may be involved in the sensitization and recruitment of these 
inflammatory cells. To separate the responses of resident cells from those of 
cells infiltrating from the periphery, we used dexamethasone to inhibit 
inflammatory reactions in BD. Treatment with dexamethasone prevented the 
development of clinical signs of BD, and the brains of treated animals showed no 
neuropathological lesions and a virtual absence of markers of inflammation, cell 
infiltration, or activation normally seen in the CNS of BDV-infected rats. In 
contrast, treatment with dexamethasone exacerbated the expression of BDV RNA, 
which was paralleled by a similarly elevated expression of mRNAs for egr-1, 
c-fos, and c-jun. Furthermore, dexamethasone failed to inhibit the increase in 
expression of mRNAs for tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory 
protein 1 beta, interleukin 6, and mob-1, which occurs in the CNS of animals 
infected with BDV. Our findings suggest that these genes, encoding transcription 
factors, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines, might be directly activated 
in CNS resident cells by BDV. This result supports the hypothesis that the 
initial phase of the inflammatory response to BDV infection in the brain may be 
dependent upon virus-induced activation of CNS resident cells."
8917679,"Exposure to silica dust can result in lung inflammation that may progress to 
fibrosis, for which there is no effective clinical treatment. The mechanisms 
involved in the development of pulmonary silicosis have not been well defined; 
however, most current evidence implicates a central role for alveolar 
macrophages (AM) in this process. We propose that the fibrotic potential of a 
particulate depends upon its ability to cause apoptosis in AM. In this study, 
human AM were treated with fibrogenic, poorly fibrogenic, and nonfibrogenic 
model particulates, such as silica (133 micrograms/ml), amorphous silica (80 
micrograms/ml), and titanium dioxide (60 micrograms/ml), respectively. Cell were 
treated with these particulates in vitro for 6 and 24 hr and examined for 
apoptosis by morphological analysis, DNA fragmentation, and levels of cytosolic 
histone-bound DNA fragments (cell death ELISA assays). Treatment with silica 
resulted in morphological changes typical of apoptotic cells, enhanced DNA 
fragmentation (a characteristic feature of programmed cell death), and 
significant alveolar macrophage apoptosis as observed by cell death ELISA 
assays. In contrast, amorphous silica and titanium dioxide demonstrated no 
significant apoptotic potential. To elucidate the possible mechanism by which 
silica causes apoptosis, we investigated the role of the scavenger receptor (SR) 
in silica-induced apoptosis. Cells were pretreated with and without SR ligand 
binding inhibitor, polyinosinic acid (poly(I), 500 micrograms/ml), for 10 min 
prior to silica treatment. Pretreatment with poly(I) resulted in complete 
inhibition of silica-induced apoptosis as measured by cell death ELISA. Further, 
we examined the involvement of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE) in 
silica-mediated apoptosis using an ICE inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl 
ketone. Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone inhibited silica-induced apoptosis and 
IL-1 beta release. These results suggest that fibrogenic particulates, such as 
silica, caused apoptosis of alveolar macrophages and that this apoptotic 
potential of fibrogenic particulates may be a critical factor in initiating an 
inflammatory response resulting in fibrosis. Additionally, silica-induced 
apoptosis of alveolar macrophages may be due to the interaction of silica 
particulates with the SR, initiating one or a number of signaling pathways 
involving ICE, ultimately leading to apoptosis."
8918594,"The CH1 domains of antibodies belonging to the following five murine 
immunoglobulin (Ig) classes IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 and IgA have been compared. 
The IgG CH1 domain structures are, as would be expected, similar overall, but 
show local conformational variations. When compared with IgG CH1 domain 
structures, the IgA CH1 domain displays several significant structural 
differences, which are a consequence of insertions/ deletions and specific 
structural constraints. In regions of structural differences in the IgG CH1 
domains, the spatial correspondence of residues is not reflected by conventional 
(Kabat) sequence number. Thus the sequence alignment and numbering for CH1 
domains has been revised to be consistent with the three-dimensional alignments."
8918932,"We describe the structural implications of a periodic pattern found in human 
exons and introns by hidden Markov models. We show that exons (besides the 
reading frame) have a specific sequential structure in the form of a pattern 
with triplet consensus non-T(A/T)G, and a minimal periodicity of roughly ten 
nucleotides. The periodic pattern is also present in intron sequences, although 
the strength per nucleotide is weaker. Using two independent profile methods 
based on triplet bendability parameters from DNase I experiments and nucleosome 
positioning data, we show that the pattern in multiple alignments of internal 
exon and intron sequences corresponds to a periodic ""in phase"" bending potential 
towards the major groove of the DNA. The nucleosome positioning data show that 
the consensus triplets (and their complements) have a preference for locations 
on a bent double helix where the major groove faces inward and is compressed. 
The in-phase triplets are located adjacent to GCC/GGC triplets known to have the 
strongest bias in their positioning on the nuclesome. Analysis of mRNA sequences 
encoding proteins with known tertiary structure exclude the possibility that the 
pattern is a consequence of the previously well-known periodicity caused by the 
encoding of alpha-helices in proteins. Finally, we discuss the relation between 
the bending potential of coding and non-coding regions and its impact on the 
translational positioning of nucleosomes and the recognition of genes by the 
transcriptional machinery."
8920706,"In a four cell trial, a single 10(4) plaque-forming unit dose of rhesus 
rotavirus (RRV) vaccine (serotype G3), a human rotavirus-rhesus rotavirus 
reassortant vaccine with serotype G1 specificity, a similar vaccine with 
serotype G2 specificity, or a placebo was administered with buffer orally at 2 
months of age to 800 Peruvian infants. Only the RRV vaccine was associated with 
a febrile response (< 38 degrees C) that occurred in 9% of the infants on day 4 
after vaccination. Diarrhea or other side-effects were not associated with 
administration of vaccine. Vaccine strains were shed by only 12-18% of the 
infants as determined by examination of a single stool specimen obtained on days 
4 or 5 after vaccination. Fifty per cent of vaccines developed an IgA ELISA 
seroresponse; however, a serotype-specific seroresponse by plaque reduction 
neutralization was demonstrated in < 20% of the participants against each of the 
three candidate vaccine strains. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated by twice-weekly 
home surveillance for diarrheal diseases during 24 months post-immunization. 
Rotavirus diarrheal episodes were identified by ELISA. Only the RRV vaccine had 
a significant protective efficacy (29%, p = 0.03, chi-square test) against 
rotavirus diarrhea. Analysis of vaccine efficacy against rotavirus episodes of 
any severity in which no other enteropathogen was isolated showed a trend 
towards higher vaccine efficacy. In addition, a similar trend was observed in 
rotavirus-only episodes in which there was some degree of dehydration or when 
health services were utilized. Serotype G1 or G2 rotavirus strains were most 
prevalent during surveillance. Neither serotype G1 or serotype G2 vaccines were 
protective against serotype 1 or 2 rotavirus diarrhea, respectively. The 
serotype G2 vaccine was 84% protective against serotype 1 and 2 dehydrating 
rotavirus diarrhea in the small numbers of individuals evaluated. We conclude 
that one dose of 10(4) p.f.u. of the RRV, serotype G1, or serotype G2 rotavirus 
vaccine failed to induce either an adequate serotype-specific seroresponse or 
serotype-specific protection in children immunized at 2 months of age. Only the 
RRV vaccine induced a low level of protection against rotavirus diarrhea mainly 
of serotype G1 specificity. Future studies need to explore whether higher 
vaccine dose and/or more than one dose would increase the immunogenicity and 
efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine, especially in developing countries with a 
high level of baseline rotavirus antibodies."
8920722,"The single cell gel test (SCG-test or comet assay) is a rapid and sensitive 
method for measuring DNA damage and repair in individual cells. A wide variety 
of mutagens have been shown to cause DNA alterations detectable with the comet 
assay, but it is not yet clear whether a relationship exists between the DNA 
effects and the induction of mutations. We are therefore investigating in a cell 
culture system with human cells (MRC5CV1) the induction of DNA damage by 
environmental mutagens and the formation of mutations at the HPRT gene. In the 
present study we investigated benzo[a]pyrene (BP), an environmental mutagenic 
and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and its reactive metabolite 
(+)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol 9, 10-oxide ((+)-anti-BPDE). S9 mix activated 
BP and the direct acting mutagen (+)-anti-BPDE caused a concentration-related 
increase in DNA migration in the comet assay. Postincubation experiments 
indicated that induced DNA effects are eliminated by DNA repair within 24 h. 
BP-treatment caused a strong genotoxic effect in the comet assay but had only a 
marginal effect on the frequency of gene mutations. When cells were treated with 
BP in the presence of cadmium sulphate, a clear increase in genotoxicity was 
observed while the effect on mutations was unchanged. Our results indicate that 
DNA alterations detected with the comet assay do not necessarily relate to 
mutagenesis. The absence of a close relationship between DNA migration in the 
comet assay and mutagenesis may be explained by the fact that some effects seen 
in the comet assay occur as a consequence of an error free DNA repair process."
8923000,"Type V collagen is a constituent of type I collagen-rich fibrils in many 
connective tissues and is a regulator of fibril diameter. In tissues, type V 
collagen is a heterotrimer with the molecular structure: alpha 1(V)2 alpha 2(V) 
or alpha 1(V) alpha 2(V) alpha 3(V). We report that genomic polymorphisms at the 
pro alpha 1(V) gene (COL5A1) locus cosegregated with the gravis form of 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) (type I) in a three generation family. Affected 
family members, who had classical features including joint hyperextensibility, 
fragile skin, and widened, atrophic scars, were heterozygous for a 4 bp deletion 
at positions from +3 to +6 of intron 65, which resulted in removal of exon 65 
sequences from processed mRNAs. Since exon 65 encodes 78 residues of the 
carboxyl propeptide, the expected result of this mutation is reduced efficiency 
in incorporating mutant pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen molecules and 
reduced type V collagen synthesis. These studies indicate that heterozygous 
mutations in COL5A1 can result in EDS type I. However, linkage studies in other 
EDS I families indicate the disorder is heterogeneous; linkage to both COL5A1 
and COL5A2 was excluded in two other families with EDS I while a fourth family 
was concordant for linkage to COL5A1 (Z = 2.11; theta = 0.00)."
8927353,"In connection with two cases authors review our current body of knowledge on 
Saint's triad that means the concomitant occurrence of cholelithiasis, hiatus 
hernia and colonic diverticulosis. Though each component of this syndrome is 
fairly common, the Saint's triad is relatively seldom encountered. It does 
happen so because not all the components are likely to cause clinical symptoms. 
Consequently diagnosis and subsequent therapy are targeted at the dominating 
symptoms. On the other hand, the existence of the syndrome is also not 
sufficiently known in clinical practice. Authors stress that in the event of 
simultaneous symptoms suggestive of atypic cholelithiasis, colonic 
diverticulosis and hiatus hernia one has to consider a potential Saint's triad. 
Therefore it is recommended to verify or exclude each of the three components to 
establish a precise diagnosis and adequate subsequent therapy."
8929375,"We report the case of a Japanese boy whose dysmorphic features were consistent 
with those of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The radiological features were 
characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of 
short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted 
ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches. Apart from the 
craniosynostosis, these skeletal changes resembled those of frontometaphyseal 
dysplasia, a well-known craniotubular dysplasia. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome 
also shares many clinical features with frontometaphyseal dysplasia."
8935410,"Glycogen-storage disease type II, Pompe disease, is caused by the deficiency of 
acid alpha-D-glucosidase in lysosome. Previously we found that acid 
alpha-D-glucosidase did exist in the skin fibroblasts and there was also no 
difference of mRNA in quantity and size of Chinese infantile type Pompe disease 
patients in Taiwan. However, functional assay of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase of 
these patients showed its enzyme function to be defective. In the present study, 
first we identified a substitution site in four Chinese infantile patients with 
Pompe disease which is a cytidine to adenosine (C1935-->A) transversion at 5' 
end of exon 14 causing substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at 
position 645 of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase. This substitution was introduced 
in wild-type cDNA and expressed in COS-1 cells. The Asp-645-->Glu substitution 
resulted in significant reduction of acid alpha-D-glucosidase activity. Second, 
according to the screening data in 25 Chinese Pompe disease patients using 
digestion of RT-PCR amplified specific fragment with Aat II, the restriction 
fragment length analysis showed that patients presented the 861 bp band and the 
normal individuals presented the 728 bp and 133 bp polymorphic bands. We found 
that the frequency of mutant allele is 0.8 in infantile patients with Chinese 
Pompe disease and 0 in normal individuals. These results therefore indicate that 
Asp-645-->Glu mutation results in infantile form of Pompe disease as the major 
cause in Chinese patients in Taiwan."
8936679,"Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone are by definition independent of nuclear 
receptors for the hormone and have been described at the plasma membrane, 
various cell organelles, the cytoskeleton, and in cytoplasm. The actions include 
alterations in solute transport (Ca2+, Na+, glucose), changes in activities of 
several kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and 
pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), effects on efficiency of specific mRNA translation 
and mRNA t1/2, modulation of mitochondrial respiration, and regulation of actin 
polymerization (promotion of formation of F-actin). Iodothyronines also can 
regulate nongenomically the state of contractile elements in vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMC). The physiologic significance at the cellular level of 
certain of these actions has been demonstrated, for example, in the cases of 
myocardiocyte Na+ current, red cell Ca2+ content, and the control by 
hormone-induced alterations in actin solubility of cell surface activity of 
iodothyronine 5'-monodeiodinase activity and the intracellular distribution of 
protein disulfide isomerase activity. The physiologic significance of these 
actions at the organ or system level is less clear, but extranuclear effects of 
thyroid hormone on myocardial Na+ channel, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 
activity, and contractile state of VSMC may each contribute to acute effects of 
thyroid hormone on cardiac output that have recently been described clinically. 
The molecular mechanisms for nongenomic actions are incompletely understood; 
relevant binding sites and signal transduction pathways have been described for 
hormone actions on plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, and PKM2 monomer is 
known to bind T3 and, as a result, prevent activation of the kinase via tetramer 
formation. Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone may have different 
structure-activity relationships of iodothyronines from those effects that 
depend upon nuclear receptors; they may have different time courses and may 
invoke complex signal transduction pathways before the action is detected."
8936682,"The possibility that thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves 
cardiac performance might be useful in the treatment of heart failure has-been 
examined. In the rat postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low 
doses (1.5 micrograms/100 g) of thyroxine (T4) for 3 days produced a positive 
inotropic response, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and a 
decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). When treatment with T4 was 
continued at the same or higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10-12 days, 
heart rate was increased and improvement in LVEDP was not sustained. To identify 
an analogue with a more favorable hemodynamic profile, single- and double-ring 
compounds related to T4 were screened for thyromimetic activity in heart cell 
cultures and for their ability to bind thyroid hormone receptors. One of the 
analogues selected, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), was found to have 
inotropic selectivity in hypothyroid rats. When administered (375 micrograms/100 
g) to rats with ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction in 
combination with captopril, there was improvement of the resting and stressed 
cardiac index and LV filling pressure. Similar improvement in cardiac 
performance was obtained when DITPA was administered to rabbits after 
infarction. Thus a thyroid hormone analogue with inotropic selectivity may be a 
useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of heart failure."
8936683,"Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac 
conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not 
been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a 
reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified 
in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the 
strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to 
be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3 
administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic 
rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to 
be generally within the normal range. A preliminary safety study of short-term 
intravenous T3 administration (bolus +/- 6 h infusion, total dose 0.15-2.7 
micrograms/kg) was then performed in 23 patients under hemodynamic and 
electrocardiographic monitoring. There were neither adverse events nor 
substantial hemodynamic changes, but some patients had an increase in cardiac 
output, consistent with a peripheral vasodilatory effect. With this foundation, 
further investigation into the possible role of T3 and its analogs in congestive 
heart failure therapy may be pursued."
8937199,"We report a case of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) complicated with juvenile 
stroke. The patient is a 19-year-old man with right hemiplegia, who has had a 
history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) for ten years. The 
diagnosis of PWS was confirmed genetically by the method of fluorescence in situ 
hybridization which showed the deletion of chromosome 15. His brain MRI revealed 
abnormal signal intensities in the left basal ganglia and around the right 
trigone of the lateral ventricle. Angiographic examination showed occlusions of 
bilateral proximal middle cerebral arteries with basal moyamoya vessels. The 
left vertebral artery was also occluded at its origin. Only a few cases of PWS 
complicated with stroke have been reported before and, to date, there has been 
no case with arterial occlusion similar to our case. Though the cause of these 
arterial occlusions is unknown, it may be related to arteriosclerosis following 
NIDDM."
8937982,"Transcriptional silencing is known to occur at centromeres, telomeres and the 
mating type region in the nucleus of fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. 
Mating-type silencing factors have previously been shown also to affect 
transcriptional repression within centromeres and to some extent at telomeres. 
Mutations in the clr4+, rik1+ and swi6+ genes dramatically reduce silencing at 
certain centromeric regions and cause elevated chromosome loss rates. Recently, 
Swi6p was found to co-localise with the three silent chromosomal regions. Here 
the involvement of clr4+, rik1+ and swi6+ in centromere function is investigated 
in further detail. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to show 
that, as in swi6 mutant cells, centromeres lag on late anaphase spindles in clr4 
and rik1 mutant cells. This phenotype is consistent with a role for these three 
gene products in fission yeast centromere function. The Swi6 protein was found 
to be delocalised from all three silent chromosomal regions, and dispersed 
within the nucleus, in both clr4 and rik1 mutant cells. The phenotypic 
similarity observed in all three mutants is consistent with the products of both 
the clr4+ and rik1+ genes being required to recruit Swi6p to the centromere and 
other silent regions. Mutations in clr4, rik1 and swi6 also result in elevated 
sensitivity to reagents which destabilise microtubules and show a synergistic 
interaction with a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene (nda3). These observations 
suggest that clr4+ and rik1+ must play a role in the assembly of Swi6p into a 
transcriptionally silent, inaccessible chromatin structure at fission yeast 
centromeres which is required to facilitate interactions with spindle 
microtubules and to ensure normal chromosome segregation."
8938781,"OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of 
hemophilia, occurring in 1 to 2% of patients with severe hemophilia. Its 
principal sites of occurrence are the long bones and the pelvis. Only one case 
of this tumor occurring in the cranium has been previously reported.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor 
involving the diploe of the right parietal vault. A 29-year-old man with severe 
hemophilia (Factor VIII, 0.8% of normal activity) presented with an unsightly 
scalp protrusion measuring 5 x 5 x 2 cm and tingling discomfort in the left arm. 
About 5 years before admission, he noted a walnut-sized, nontender mass in the 
right parietal area that had enlarged slightly after minor head trauma. Tingling 
discomfort developed as the manifestation of the compression of the parietal 
lobe in the 2 to 3 months after the head trauma.
INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken 
for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in 
the diploe revealed old blood coagulum.
CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved 
completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic 
pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial 
hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature."
8938977,"Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a member of the family Poxviridae and 
pathogenic to humans. MCV causes benign epidermal tumors mainly in children and 
young adults and is a common pathogen in immunecompromised individuals. The 
viral DNA polymerase is the essential enzyme involved in the replication of the 
genome of DNA viruses. The identification and characterization of the gene 
encoding the DNA polymerase of molluscum contagiosum virus type 1 (MCV-1) was 
carried out by PCR technology and nucleotide sequence analysis. Computer-aided 
analysis of known amino acid sequences of DNA polymerases from two members of 
the poxvirus family revealed a high amino acid sequence homology of about 49.7% 
as detected between the DNA polymerases of vaccinia virus (genus Orthopoxvirus) 
and fowlpoxvirus (genus Avipoxvirus). Specific oligonucleotide primers were 
designed and synthesized according to the distinct conserved regions of amino 
acid sequences of the DNA polymerases in which the codon usage of the MCV-1 
genome was considered. Using this technology a 228 bp DNA fragment was amplified 
and used as hybridization probe for identifying the corresponding gene of the 
MCV-1 genome. It was found that the PCR product was able to hybridize to the 
BamHI MCV-1 DNA fragment G (9.2 kbp, 0.284 to 0.332 map units). The nucleotide 
sequence of this particular region of the MCV-1 genome (7267 bp) between map 
coordinates 0.284 and 0.315 was determined. The analysis of the DNA sequences 
revealed the presence of 22 open reading frames (ORFs-1 to -22). ORF-13 (3012 
bp; nucleotide positions 6624 to 3612) codes for a putative protein of a 
predicted size of 115 kDa (1004 aa) which shows 40.1% identity and 35% 
similarity to the amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerases of vaccinia, 
variola, and fowlpoxvirus. In addition significant homologies (30% to 55%) were 
found between the amino acid sequences of the ORFs 3, -5, -9, and -14 and the 
amino acid sequences of the E6R, E8R, E10R, and a 7.3 kDa protein of vaccinia 
and variola virus, respectively. Comparative analysis of the genomic positions 
of the loci of the detected viral genes including the DNA polymerases of MCV-1, 
vaccinia, and variola virus revealed a similar gene organization and 
arrangement."
8939965,"We have investigated the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase II (CaM kinase II) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in 
norepinephrine (NE)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in rabbit aortic 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). NE enhanced release of AA via activation of 
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not secretory PLA2 in VSMC prelabeled 
with [3H]AA. NE (10 microM) enhanced CaM kinase II and MAP kinase activity. In 
cells transiently transfected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to 
the translation initiation sites of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase, NE-induced AA 
release was inhibited by 100 and 35% respectively. Treatment of cells with 
PD-098059, a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, or with MAP kinase antisense 
oligonucleotide reduced NE-induced activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2. 
NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated 
with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense 
oligonucleotide. On the other hand, inhibition of MAP kinase kinase with 
PD-098059 or of MAP kinase with antisense oligonucleotides did not alter the 
NE-induced increase in CaM kinase II activity. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase and 
CaM kinase II by NE, studied by 32P incorporation and immune complex kinase 
assays, was inhibited by KN-93. Collectively, these data suggest that CaM kinase 
II can activate MAP kinase, which in turn activates cPLA2 to release AA for 
prostacyclin synthesis in the rabbit VSMC. This novel pathway for activation of 
MAP kinase by CaM kinase II appears to be mediated through stimulation of MAP 
kinase kinase. Activation of adrenergic receptors with NE in VSMC caused 
translocation of CaM kinase II, MAP kinase, and cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope 
only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Okadaic acid, which increased 
phosphorylation and activity, did not translocate these enzymes. Therefore, it 
appears that in rabbit VSMC, NE, by promoting extracellular Ca2+ influx, 
increases CaM kinase II activity, leading to activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2 
and translocation to the nuclear envelope, resulting in release of AA from the 
nuclear envelope for prostacyclin synthesis."
8940268,"Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder 
caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, the lysosomal enzyme 
responsible for the degradation of the myelin glycolipid galactocerebroside. 
Although the most common form of the disease is the classical infantile form 
(Krabbe disease), later-onset forms also have been described. We have analyzed 
the galactocerebrosidase gene in 17 patients (nine families) with late-onset GLD 
and in 1 patient with classical Krabbe disease. Half of the patients were 
heterozygous for the large gene deletion associated with the 502C-->T 
polymorphism, the most common mutation in infantile patients. Several novel 
mutations that result in deficient galactocerebrosidase activity were also 
identified in these patients. They include the missense mutations R63H, G95S, 
M101L, G268S, Y298C, and I234T; the nonsense mutation S7X; a one-base deletion 
(805delG); a mutation that interferes with the splicing of intron 1; and a 34-nt 
insertion in the RNA, caused by the aberrant splicing of intron 6. All of these 
genetic defects are clustered in the first 10 exons of the galactocerebrosidase 
gene and therefore affect the 50-kD subunit of the mature enzyme. Studies on the 
distribution and enzymatic activity of the polymorphic alleles 1637T/C 
(I546/T546) provided support for previous data that had indicated the existence 
of two galactocerebrosidase forms with different catalytic activities in the 
general population. Our data also indicate that the mutations occur 
preferentially in the ""low activity"" 1637C allele."
8941093,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the Marfan syndrome, an 
autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular 
complications. Aneurysms or dissections of the ascending thoracic aorta are the 
major cardiovascular complications of the disorder. We tested the hypothesis 
that FBN1 mutations cause thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections in patients 
who do not have the Marfan syndrome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The FBN1 gene was screened for mutations by use of genomic 
DNA from two patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms who did not have the Marfan 
syndrome. Individual FBN1 exons were amplified with intron-based exon-specific 
primers; the DNA fragments were screened for mutations using single-stranded 
conformational polymorphism analysis; and aberrantly migrating bands were 
sequenced directly. We identified a missense mutation in one patient, D1155N in 
exon 27. Dermal fibroblasts from the affected individual were used to study the 
effect of the missense mutation D1155N on fibrillin-1 cellular processing. The 
mutation decreased the amount of fibrillin-1 deposited into the pericellular 
matrix. A second putative FBN1 mutation was identified in the second patient, 
P1837S in exon 44. Although this alteration was not observed in 234 chromosomes 
from unrelated individuals, the alteration may represent a rare polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies support the hypothesis that FBN1 mutations 
cause thoracic aortic aneurysms in patients who do not have the Marfan syndrome. 
This information is important for understanding the pathogenesis of aortic 
aneurysms and identification of individuals at risk for developing thoracic 
aortic aneurysms or dissections."

associated with muscle involvement, are not reactive with antibodies specific to 
plectin. We demonstrated that in the skin, lack of plectin leads to failure of 
keratin filaments to connect to the plasma membrane via the hemidesmosomes, 
whereas in the muscle the deficient expression of the molecule correlates with 
an aberrant localization of desmin in the muscle fibers. In this study we 
demonstrate that in a MD-EBS kindred with two affected members, the disease 
results from a homozygous nonsense mutation in the plectin (PLEC1) gene leading 
to a premature stop codon (CGA to TGA) and decay of the aberrant plectin 
messenger RNA. The segregation of the mutated allele implicates the mutation in 
the pathology of the disorder. These results confirm the critical role of 
plectin in providing cell resistance to mechanical stresses both in the skin and 
the muscle."
8941714,"Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to 
result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear 
enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Here, molecular 
interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of 
topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using 
surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy. The work is based on data of the 
previously performed model SER experiments dealing with amsacrine/DNA, 
drug/topoisomerase II and drug/DNA/topoisomerase II complexes in aqueous buffer 
solutions. The SER data indicated two kinds of amsacrine interactions in the 
model complexes with topoisomerase II alone or within ternary complex: 
non-specific (via the acridine moiety) and specific to the enzyme conformation 
(via the side chain of the drug). These two types of interactions have been both 
revealed by the micro-SER spectra of amsacrine within living K562 cancer cells. 
Our data suppose the specific interactions of amsacrine with topoisomerase II 
via the side chain of the drug (particular feature of the drug/topoisomerase II 
and ternary complexes) to be crucial for its inhibitory activity."
8942253,"The human body is unable to synthesise Vitamin C and a diet deficient in Vitamin 
C leads to scurvy. Scurvy may mimic other medical conditions, like bleeding 
diasthesis or deep vein thrombosis, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment, 
thus prolonging sufferings of patients. Often, scurvy could have been diagnosed 
if it is thought of and features of scurvy carefully looked for. Scurvy is 
easily treated with high dose of oral vitamin C. Recurrences may occur. 
Education of care providers cannot be overemphasised. We report three local 
cases of scurvy to highlight the existence of the disease in our modern society."
8942272,"Primary tumours of the liver are uncommon in childhood. Of these, more than 
two-thirds are malignant. As such, benign hepatic tumours are often not 
considered in the differential diagnosis of a hepatic mass in childhood. We 
report a case of hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma, a rare benign tumour, in a 
10-month-old infant. This tumour is characterised by an admixture of ductal 
structures within a copious loose connective tissue stroma. Only approximately 
160 cases had been reported in the literature. Awareness of the ultrasound (U/S) 
and computed tomography (CT) features, although not diagnostic, is helpful in 
distinguishing it from the more common malignant tumours. A correct preoperative 
diagnosis is important as surgical excision is often curative."
8943015,"Until recently, the degradation of aberrant and unassembled proteins retained in 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was thought to involve unidentified ER-localized 
proteases. We now show that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of two mutant 
proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen is inhibited in a proteasome-defective 
yeast strain and when cytosol from this mutant is used in an in vitro assay. In 
addition, ERAD is limited in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors, 
3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and lactacystin. Furthermore, we find that an ERAD 
substrate is exported from ER-derived microsomes, and the accumulation of 
exported substrate is 2-fold greater when proteasome mutant cytosol is used in 
place of wild-type cytosol. We conclude that lumenal ERAD substrates are 
exported from the yeast ER to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome 
complex."
8944217,"A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented 
with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of 
which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only 
identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease."
8944774,"A glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (class III alcohol 
dehydrogenase) has been characterized from Arabidopsis thaliana. This plant 
enzyme exhibits kinetic and molecular properties in common with the class III 
forms from mammals, with a K(m) for S-hydroxymethylglutathione of 1.4 microM, an 
anodic electrophoretic mobility (pI: 5.3-5.6) and a cross-reaction with 
anti-(rat class III alcohol dehydrogenase) antibodies. The enzyme structure, 
deduced from the cDNA sequence, fits into the complex system of alcohol 
dehydrogenases and shows that all life forms share the class III protein type. 
The corresponding mRNA is 1.4 kb and present in all plant organs; a single copy 
of the gene is found in the genome. The class III structural variability is 
different from that of the ethanol-active enzyme types in both vertebrates 
(class I) and plants (class P), although class P conserves more of the class III 
properties than class I does. Also the enzymatic properties differ between the 
two ethanol-active classes. Active-site variability and exchanges at essential 
residues (Leu/Gly57, Asp/Arg115) may explain the distinct kinetics. These 
patterns are consistent with two different metabolic roles for the 
ethanol-active enzymes, a more constant function, reduction of acetaldehyde 
during hypoxia, for class P, and a more variable function, the detoxication of 
alcohols and participation in metabolic conversions, for class I. A sequence 
motif, Pro-Xaa-Ile/Val-Xaa-Gly-His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Gly, common to all medium-chain 
alcohol dehydrogenases is defined."
8946266,"Observational studies have found that persons who consume large amounts of fruit 
and vegetables have lower rates of coronary heart disease. The strength of 
epidemiologic evidence, however, differs for each of the antioxidant vitamins. 
High intake of vitamin E from food or supplements has generally been associated 
with a lower incidence of coronary heart disease. The evidence for beta-carotene 
intake is inconsistent, with several studies finding a modest reduction in risk 
among persons with high intake, and others failing to find an association. 
Although many studies have examined the relationship between vitamin C intake 
and cardiovascular disease, no significant benefit was seen in any of the large 
studies that were able to control for other antioxidant intake or multivitamin 
use. Observational studies cannot discern whether the decreased risk observed is 
caused by the antioxidants themselves or other characteristics of the 
individuals who consume them. The epidemiologic associations may be due to other 
nutrients in antioxidant-rich foods, or other dietary or lifestyle factors. 
Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm or refute the 
observational data. On the basis of available evidence, we should recommend a 
healthy diet, rich in fruit and vegetables, but should not endorse vitamin 
supplementation unless conclusive evidence of benefit is demonstrated in 
clinical trials."

8951354,"Since dose intensity of doxorubicin is correlated with the clinical response of 
patients with soft tissue sarcomas and since doxorubicin dose intensity may be 
compromised in combination chemotherapy, we evaluated the use of recombinant 
granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) to ameliorate 
myelosuppression and allow doxorubicin dose escalation in a phase I trial 
utilizing the MAID combination [Mesna 2.5 g/m2/day x 4 days, Adriamycin 
(doxorubicin) 15 mg/m2/day x 4 days, ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2/day x 3 days, 
dacarbazine 250 mg/m2/day x 4 days; to be repeated every 21 days]. Thirteen 
patients were treated. The doxorubicin dose for the first 6 patients was at the 
standard dose of 15 mg/m2/day x 4 days (level 1), while the doxorubicin dose for 
the next 7 patients was escalated by 25% to 18.75 mg/m2/day x 4 days (level 2). 
rGM-CSF was given at 5 micrograms/kg/day, days 5-14. All patients experienced 
moderate to severe myelosuppression, with all patients at dose level 2 requiring 
doxorubicin dose reduction to dose level 1 or lower by their third course of 
treatment. rGM-CSF failed to allow sustained escalation of the doxorubicin dose 
in the MAID regimen."
8952658,"Originally developed against the effects of ionizing radiations, amifostine is 
an organic thiophosphate compound shown able to selectively protect normal 
tissues against cytotoxic agents in cellular and animal models, without 
protecting tumor tissues. Amifostine is a prodrug which is dephosphorylated into 
its active metabolite, a free thiol derivative, by membrane alkaline phosphatase 
of the target issue. This unique metabolism supports its cellular selectivity 
and its preferential uptake by normal tissues. In phase II clinical trials, a 
decreased toxicity has been demonstrated in patients given alkylating agents; 
however, reduction of the response has not been observed. On the basis of these 
results, a prospective, randomized, phase III study has been conducted in 
patients with ovarian carcinoma receiving a combination of cisplatinum and 
cyclophosphamide. A significant decrease in hematologic, renal and neurologic 
toxicity was observed in the amifostine-treated patients compared with the 
control group, and response rates did not significantly differ between the two 
groups. Insufficient or emerging data are only available for other applications, 
including either in vitro manipulation of hematopoietic grafts or in vivo 
treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck carcinoma, non-small cell 
lung cancer and radioprotection. No data are yet available in regard to the 
potential protective effects of amifostine against mutagenicity and 
cancerogenicity of both chemo- and radiotherapy."
8954015,"Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue 
responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH 
phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor 
beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique 
family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with 
abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing 
and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of 
RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8- 
to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine 
abnormalities were detected. The defect developed de novo in the proposita and 
was transmitted to her two children of unrelated fathers. As cultured 
fibroblasts from the proposita responded poorly to T3 despite a normal 
concentration of TR, other abnormalities in the mediation of T3 action were 
sought. Nucleotide sequences of the TSH beta promoter, containing thyroid 
hormone response elements, and TR-interacting protein 1 were normal. Nuclear 
extracts (NE) of cultured skin fibroblasts from affected individuals of this 
family were tested for their interaction with normal TR beta and thyroid hormone 
response elements by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NE from the 
proposita showed a strong additional band compared to NEs from normal 
individuals and patients with RTH caused by TR beta mutations or deletion. Far 
Western analysis of NE from the affected daughter hybridized with labeled TR 
beta demonstrated an additional band that was not seen in NEs from a normal 
control or patients with TR beta gene defects. It is concluded that the etiology 
of RTH is not confined to abnormalities in the TR beta gene. An abnormal 
cofactor with a specific function in the regulation of thyroid hormone action is 
probably involved in the expression of the RTH phenotype in this family."
8955148,"The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with 
transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all 
of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P 
(Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and 
the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at 
least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich) 
domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg 
proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione 
S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize 
through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids. 
Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located 
within the Q domain."
8955395,"We report the characterization of a gene encoding a novel flocculin related to 
the STA genes of yeast, which encode secreted glucoamylase. The STA genes 
comprise sequences that are homologous to the sporulation-specific glucoamylase 
SGA and to two other sequences, S2 and S1. We find that S2 and S1 are part of a 
single gene which we have named FLO11. The sequence of FLO11 reveals a 4,104-bp 
open reading frame on chromosome IX whose predicted product is similar in 
overall structure to the class of yeast serine/threonine-rich GPI-anchored cell 
wall proteins. An amino-terminal domain containing a signal sequence and a 
carboxy-terminal domain with homology to GPI (glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol) 
anchor-containing proteins are separated by a central domain containing a highly 
repeated threonine- and serine-rich sequence. Yeast cells that express FLO11 
aggregate in the calcium-dependent process of flocculation. Flocculation is 
abolished when FLO11 is disrupted. The product of STA1 also is shown to have 
flocculating activity. When a green fluorescent protein fusion of FLO11 was 
expressed from the FLO11 promoter on a single-copy plasmid, fluorescence was 
observed in vivo at the periphery of cells. We propose that FLO11 encodes a 
flocculin because of its demonstrated role in flocculation, its structural 
similarity to other members of the FLO gene family, and the cell surface 
location of its product. FLO11 gene sequences are present in all yeast strains 
tested, including all standard laboratory strains, unlike the STA genes which 
are present only in the variant strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. 
diastaticus. FLO11 differs from all other yeast flocculins in that it is located 
near a centromere rather than a telomere, and its expression is regulated by 
mating type. Repression of FLO11-dependent flocculation in diploids is conferred 
by the mating-type repressor al/alpha2."
8955902,"Selenocysteine, a selenium-containing analog of cysteine, is found in the 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms in active sites of enzymes involved in 
oxidation-reduction reactions. Its biosynthesis and cotranslational insertion 
into selenoproteins is performed by an outstanding mechanism, implying the 
participation of several gene products. The tRNA(Sec) is one of these. In 
eukaryotes, its transcription mode by RNA polymerase III differs from that of 
classical tRNA genes, both at the level of the promoter elements and 
transcription factors involved. In addition, enhanced transcription is afforded 
by a newly characterized zinc finger activator. Not only transcription of the 
gene, but also the tRNA(Sec) itself is atypical since its 2D and 3D structures 
exhibit features which set it apart from classical tRNAs. Decoding of eukaryotic 
selenocysteine UGA codons requires a stem-loop structure in the 3'UTR of mRNAs, 
the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Structure probing and 
sequence comparisons led us to propose a 2D structure model for the SECIS 
element, containing a novel RNA motif composed of four consecutive 
non-Watson-Crick base-pairs. A 3D model, rationalizing the accessibility data, 
was elaborated by computer modeling. It yields indicative or suggestive evidence 
for the role that could play some conserved residues and/or structural features 
in SECIS function. These might act as signals for interaction with SBP, the 
SECIS binding protein that we have characterized."
8956889,"BACKGROUND: Cirsoid aneurysms are uncommon arteriovenous fistulas of the scalp. 
Surgery for these lesions can be difficult; transarterial embolization is rarely 
curative, while embolization of the venous pouch with permanent agents usually 
necessitates subsequent surgical removal of the embolic material. The ideal 
embolic agent would be one that is safe and effective, commercially available, 
and would not require subsequent removal.
METHODS: We treated an arteriovenous fistula of the scalp with direct puncture 
and injection of sodium tetradecyl sulfate, a commercially available sclerosing 
agent.
RESULTS: Control angiography immediately following percutaneous injection of 
sotradecol into the fistula showed decreased flow but not complete closure of 
the lesion. However, within several days of the embolization, the patient's 
scalp pain and mass resolved. Four months after embolization, MRA demonstrated 
no evidence of residual or recurrent fistula. Color doppler flow imaging 
demonstrated only slightly decreased vascular resistance in the distal 
superficial temporal artery, possibly indirect evidence of persistent 
micro-fistulae. Twenty-three months after the procedure, the patient continued 
to be asymptomatic and had no palpable lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous injection of sotradecol can be considered as one of 
the treatment options for arteriovenous fistula of the scalp. Further experience 
is needed to compare the safety and effectiveness of sotradecol with other 
agents currently used in the treatment of scalp arteriovenous fistulae."
8957518,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by absence of a paternal contribution of 
the chromosome region 15q11-q13, resulting from paternal deletions, maternal 
uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting mutations. Laboratory diagnosis is 
currently performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA 
polymorphism (microsatellite) analysis, or DNA methylation analysis at locus 
PW71 (D15S63). We examined another parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation 
assay at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated 
polypeptide N gene (SNRPN) in patients referred with clinical suspicion of PWS 
or Angelman syndrome (AS). These included 30 PWS and 17 AS patients with known 
deletion or uniparental disomy status, and a larger cohort of patients (n = 512) 
suspected of PWS who had been analyzed previously for their methylation status 
at the PW71 locus. Results of SNRPN methylation were consistent with known 
deletion or uniparental disomy (UPD) status as determined by other molecular 
methods in all 47 cases of PWS and AS. In the larger cohort of possible PWS 
patients, SNRPN results were consistent with clinical diagnosis by examination 
and with PW71 methylation results in all cases. These data provide support for 
the use of SNRPN methylation as a diagnostic method. Because methylation 
analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with 
PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either 
PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of 
PWS. Only patients with an abnormal methylation result require further 
diagnostic investigation by FISH or DNA polymorphism analysis to distinguish 
among the three classes for accurate genetic counseling and recurrence-risk 
assessment."
8957644,"Patch testing may help to assess the culpability of a drug in an adverse 
reaction. Our aim was to study patch testing in severe cutaneous adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), 
acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and other cutaneous ADRs). 59 
patients with cutaneous ADRs were included: 22 had SJS/TEN, 14 AGEP, and 23 
other cutaneous ADRs. Patients were patch tested with the suspect drug, and with 
a standard series of drugs. 2 patients among the 22 SJS/TEN cases had a relevant 
positive test. 7 patients among the 14 AGEP cases had a relevant positive test. 
6 patients among the 23 other cutaneous ADRs had a relevant positive test. Our 
results suggest that patch testing has a weak sensitivity in SJS/TEN and is not 
appropriate in these diseases. Patch testing seems more adapted to other 
cutaneous ADRs, such as AGEP, in which the proportion of positive patch tests 
was significantly higher (p < 0.02). Nevertheless, the difference of sensitivity 
of patch testing in SJS/ TEN, AGEP or other cutaneous ADRs could be linked not 
only to the clinical type of eruption, but also to the different spectrum of 
culprit drugs in each type of eruption."
8959997,"There are four main hypotheses about the cause of ALS: excitotoxicity linked to 
glutamate receptor overactivation; mutation of the superoxide dismutase gene; 
production of autoantibodies to calcium channels; neurofilament accumulation. 
The motoneuron degeneration characteristic of ALS could be caused by any one or 
a combination of these mechanisms. Future therapeutic approaches should be based 
on these mechanisms and given in combination so that different levels of the 
degenerative process are targeted. Protection against excitotoxicity could be 
achieved with a combination of pharmacologic agents having neuroprotective 
activity, such as antiglutamate agents (e.g., riluzole), N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) and non-NMDA antagonists, free-radical scavengers, calcium-channel 
blockers, and neurotrophic factors. Gene transfer is a possible future approach 
when causative mutations are identified. Transfer of genes encoding 
neuroprotective agents or genetically modified cells stably expressing these 
agents is another possible strategy."
8960316,"Pick bodies and ballooned cells of Pick's disease and the neurofibrillary 
lesions of Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the presence of 
hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Little is known about 
the mechanisms underlying tau hyperphosphorylation in Pick's disease and the 
distribution of abnormal tau in affected neurons. We have used a panel of 
phosphorylation-dependent (AT270, AT8, AT180, 12E8, PHF-1, AT10 and Tau-1) and 
phosphorylation-independent anti-tau antibodies (N-tau 5 and 134) to stain brain 
tissue sections from subjects with Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These 
antibodies labeled Pick bodies and neurofibrillary lesions in a similar way, 
with the exception of antibody 12E8, which stained a subset of neurofibrillary 
tangles, but no Pick bodies. Moreover, abundant AT8- and PHF-1-positive neuritic 
profiles were observed in cortical areas rich in Pick bodies, even in the 
complete absence of neurofibrillary lesions. Unlike the Gallyas-positive 
neuropil threads of Alzheimer's disease, which were of variable diameter and 
covered by spiny appendages, neuritic profiles of Pick's disease showed a 
regular diameter, appeared smooth and were Gallyas-negative. In contrast to 
Alzheimer's disease, dendritic branches of neurons containing Pick bodies were 
not labeled by anti-tau antibodies. In the hippocampus, numerous tau-positive 
axon terminals were found along dendrites of the polymorphic layer of the 
dentate gyrus. Our results indicate that tau proteins in Pick's disease and 
Alzheimer's disease share similar phosphorylated residues, with the exception of 
serine 262, which is phosphorylated in Alzheimer tangles but not in Pick bodies 
or neuritic profiles. Furthermore, we show that hyperphosphorylated tau 
segregates to different neuronal compartments in the two diseases, with a 
somatoaxonal distribution in Pick's disease and a somatodendritic distribution 
in Alzheimer's disease."
8960429,"BACKGROUND: Changes in peripheral thyroid hormone concentration and metabolism 
can occur in euthyroid patients suffering from severe non-thyroidal illnesses. 
Recently, sick euthyroid syndrome has been reported in patients suffering from 
advanced heart failure.
AIM: This study was to evaluate prospectively the presence and 
pathophysiological implications of sick euthyroid syndrome in moderate-to-severe 
chronic heart failure patients.
METHODS: The study population were 199 chronic heart failure patients admitted 
over a 2-year period to our heart failure unit for assessment of cardiac 
transplantation. They were closely followed up with clinical and instrumental 
examinations (including clinical, hormonal, nutritional and cardiac function 
evaluations). Sick euthyroid syndrome was defined as a serum total 
triiodothyronine value of less than the lowest normal limit (< 1.23 nmol.l-1) in 
the presence of a normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration.
RESULTS: Sick euthyroid syndrome was found in 36/199 patients (18%). According 
to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of severity of heart 
failure, sick euthyroid syndrome patients appear in higher NYHA classes (31% of 
classes III and IV, vs 7% of class I and II). Such patients also weigh less and 
are more frequently malnourished. Alterations in cardiac index, ventricular 
filling pressures, functional impairment, and the liver function parameters, 
were more significant in sick euthyroid syndrome than in non-sick euthyroid 
syndrome patients. Serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic factor were 
significantly higher, and insulin significantly lower in the sick euthyroid 
syndrome group. During follow-up, deaths were significantly more frequent in 
sick euthyroid syndrome patients (13/27, 48%) than in non-sick euthyroid 
syndrome (30/141, 21%; P < 0.005). In six sick euthyroid syndrome patients who 
underwent heart transplantation, mean total triiodothyronine values increased 
from 0.9 +/- 0.1 before to 1.96 +/- 0.3 nmol.l(-1)post-transplantation (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In a large and representative population of patients with 
moderate-to-severe heart failure, sick euthyroid syndrome shows a prevalence of 
18%. Its occurrence was related to the degree of functional cardiac impairment, 
but was not an independent negative prognostic factor. Preliminary results 
indicate that heart transplantation is associated with reversibility of sick 
euthyroid syndrome."
8960847,"The Steno hypothesis suggests that albuminuria reflects widespread vascular 
damage (proliferative retinopathy and severe macroangiopathy) due to a 
generalized vascular (endothelial) dysfunction. We assessed this concept in 
NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetic) patients with (13 female/ 39 male, age 60 
+/- 7 years, group 1) and without (12 female /41 male, age 61 +/- 7 years, group 
2) diabetic nephropathy compared to matched non-diabetic subjects (7 female/15 
male, age 58 +/- 8 years, group 3). A 12-lead ECG was recorded and coded blindly 
using the Minnesota Rating Scale; the World Health Organization cardiovascular 
questionnaire was used to assess past and present evidence of myocardial 
infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (digital 
systolic blood pressure determination). The degree of diabetic retinopathy was 
scored from fundus photography. The following variables were measured: 
transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously 
injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin), plasma concentrations of prorenin 
(radioimmunoassay) and serum concentrations of von Willebrand factor 
(enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay). Prevalence of ischaemic heart disease 
(ECG reading) (49/20/5)% and peripheral vascular disease as indicated by reduced 
systolic blood pressure on big toe (69/30/ 14)% was significantly higher in 
group 1 vs group 2 (p < 0.01) and in group 2 vs group 3 (p < 0.01), 
respectively. The prevalence and severity of retinopathy was higher in group 1 
vs 2 (p < 0.01). Transcapillary escape rate of albumin (%/h) was elevated in 
group 1 and 2 as compared to control subjects: 7.9 (4.3-13.7); 7.4 (3.7-16.4) vs 
6.0 (3.4-8.7), (p < 0.005), respectively. Plasma prorenin activity (IU/ml) was 
raised in group 1 and group 2 as compared to group 3: 272 (59-2405); 192 
(18-813), and 85 (28-246), p < 0.001, respectively. Serum von Willebrand factor 
(IU/ ml) was elevated in group 1 as compared to group 2 and 3: 2.07 (0.83-4.34); 
1.60 (0.30-2.99) and 1.50 (1.00-2.38), p < 0.001, respectively. Our study 
demonstrated that NIDDM patients with and without albuminuria had increased 
transcapillary escape of albumin and raised prorenin activity, whereas only 
those with albuminuria had increased von Willebrand factor. Patients with NIDDM 
may have abnormal endothelial function in the absence of albuminuria."
8963604,"The study covered influence of Isradipine (2.5 mg administered twice daily 
during 6 weeks) on blood circulation in the heart and occupationally important 
functions and traits among 30 drivers having mild and moderate arterial 
hypertension (AH). Systolic and diastolic pressure demonstrate reliable decrease 
in all the examinees with mild AH and in 93.8% of the examinees with moderate 
AH. Isradipine proved to influence positively decrease of hypertensive reactions 
and subclinical myocardial ischemia. Isradipine presented statistically 
significant improvement of the studied psychophysiologic parameters (quickness 
of latent and motor visual reaction, number of errors in color choice, exactness 
in following the mobile object). Thus, all above enables to recommend Isradipine 
(Lomir) as effective and safe method correcting arterial hypertension in 
drivers."
8965089,"The purpose of this study was to establish the frequency and pattern of 
depressive disorders after surgery for acoustic neuroma, and to look for 
associations. Twenty seven patients with acoustic neuroma underwent thorough 
psychiatric assessment before surgery and at three and 12 months after surgery. 
Three patients had a depressive disorder in the preoperative assessment. Of the 
remaining 24 patients, nine (38%) had a depressive disorder at the three month 
check up. Deterioration of hearing was the only postoperative detriment 
associated with a depressive disorder (P = 0·024). All nine patients with a 
depressive disorder were women (P = 0·001), giving them a 69% incidence. None of 
the patients without preoperative depression required inpatient treatment for 
depressive disorder, but three patients out of nine still had a depressive 
disorder 12 months after surgery."
8966774,"Bartter's syndrome (BS) is a disease with severe hypokalaemia due to renal 
potassium wasting. The potassium loss is due to lesions at different sites 
within the renale tubule. Additional features include metabolic alkalosis, 
excess renal production of prostaglandins, hyperreninaemia, hyperaldosteronism 
and impaired pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin II. These secondary 
features are the result of renal potassium wasting. Symptoms are due to 
potassium deficiency, but many adult patients feel well despite marked 
hypokalaemia. The hypocalciuric variant of BS is called Gitelman's syndrome. 
These patients have a more benign course. The diagnosis of BS is one of 
exclusion, mainly of surreptitious vomiting, diuretic or laxative abuse. The 
primary treatment is potassium supplementation often in combination with 
potassium-sparing diuretics, prostaglandin inhibitors or ACE-inhibitors. With 
coexisting magnesium deficiency, magnesium supplementation might be effective."
8969181,"The Escherichia coli Uvr(A)BC endonuclease (Uvr(A)BC) initiates nucleotide 
excision repair of a large variety of DNA damages. The damage recognition and 
incision steps by the Uvr(A)BC is a complex process utilizing an ATP-dependent 
DNA helix-tracking activity associated with the UvrA2B1 complex. The latter 
activity leads to the generation of highly positively supercoiled DNA in the 
presence of E. coli topoisomerase I in vitro. Such highly positively supercoiled 
DNA, containing ultraviolet irradiation-induced photoproducts (uvDNA), is 
resistant to the incision by Uvr(A)BC, whereas the negatively supercoiled and 
relaxed forms of the uvDNA are effectively incised. The E. coli gyrase can 
contribute to the above reaction by abolishing the accumulation of highly 
positively supercoiled uvDNA thereby restoring Uvr(A)BC-catalyzed incision. 
Eukaryotic (calf thymus) topoisomerase I is able to substitute for gyrase in 
restoring this Uvr(A)BC-mediated incision reaction. The inability of Uvr(A)BC to 
incise highly positively supercoiled uvDNA results from the failure of the 
formation of UvrAB-dependent obligatory intermediates associated with the DNA 
conformational change. In contrast to Uvr(A)BC, the Micrococcus luteus UV 
endonuclease efficiently incises uvDNA regardless of its topological state. The 
in vitro topodynamic system proposed in this study may provide a simple model 
for studying a topological aspect of nucleotide excision repair and its 
interaction with other DNA topology-related processes in E. coli."
8972676,"During the autumn of 1992, Western Australia experienced a large viral 
meningitis outbreak of dual aetiology. Of the 161 cases, 64% were children under 
15 years of age, with the highest notification rate being in children less than 
5 years of age. Echovirus 9 caused 41% of cases and occurred mainly in the 
metropolitan areas of Western Australia whereas echovirus 6, which caused 37% of 
cases, was more widespread. An enterovirus was cultured from 70% of CSF 
specimens, 88% of faecal specimens and 68% of upper respiratory tract specimens. 
High CSF white cell counts and neutrophil predominance were common. Seven cases 
had normal CSF white cell counts even though an enterovirus was isolated from 
the CSF. Therefore, the CSF findings were of restricted value in excluding viral 
meningitis, and did not reliably distinguish between bacterial and viral 
meningitis."
8972850,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism is the major pathway responsible for 
the removal of a large variety of bulky lesions from the genome. Two different 
NER subpathways have been identified, i.e. the transcription-coupled and the 
global genome repair pathways. For DNA-damage induced by ultraviolet light both 
transcription-coupled repair and global genome repair are essential to confer 
resistance to cytotoxic effects. To gain further insight into the contribution 
of NER subpathways in the repair of bulky lesions and in their prevention of 
biological effects we measured the rate of repair of dG-C8-AF in active and 
inactive genes in normal human cells, XP-C cells (only transcription-coupled 
repair) and XP-A cells (completely NER-deficient) exposed to NA-AAF. XP-C cells 
are only slightly more sensitive to NA-AAF than normal cells and, like normal 
cells, they are able to recover RNA synthesis repressed by the treatment. In 
contrast, XP-A cells are sensitive to NA-AAF and unable to recover from RNA 
synthesis inhibition. Repair of dG-C8-AF in the active ADA gene proceeds in a 
biphasic way and without strand specificity, with a subclass of lesions quickly 
repaired during the first 8 h after treatment. Repair in the inactive 754 gene 
occurs more slowly than in the ADA gene. In XP-C cells, repair of dG-C8-AF in 
the ADA gene is confined to the transcribed strand and occurs at about half the 
rate of repair seen in normal cells. Repair in the inactive 754 gene in XP-C 
cells is virtually absent. Consistent with these results we found that repair 
replication in XP-C is drastically reduced when compared with normal cells and 
abolished by alpha-amanitin indicating that the repair in XP-C cells is mediated 
by transcription-coupled repair only. Our data suggest that dG-C8-AF is a target 
for transcription-coupled repair and that this repair pathway is the main 
pathway or recovery of RNA synthesis inhibition conferring resistance to 
cytotoxic effects of NA-AAF. In spite of this, repair of dG-C8-AF in active 
genes in normal cells by transcription-coupled repair and global genome repair 
is not additive, but dominated by global genome repair. This indicates that the 
subset of lesions which are capable of stalling RNA polymerase II, and are, 
therefore, a substrate for TCR, are also the lesions which are very efficiently 
recognized by the global genome repair system."
8976819,"Amifostine (Ethyol) administered to cancer patients is rapidly cleared from 
plasma by a biphasic decay with an alpha half-life (T1/2 alpha) of 0.88 min and 
a T1/2 beta of 8.8 min. The result is that more than 90% of the drug has 
disappeared from the plasma compartment 6 min after intravenous (i.v.) 
administration. Only approximately 1% of the dose appears in the ascites. Animal 
studies indicate that amifostine is primarily excreted in urine-approximately 6% 
of the dose is excreted in the urine as amifostine and its metabolites WR-1065 
and disulphides-which means that a large percentage of the dose is taken up by 
the tissues. Maximal tissue concentrations of WR-1065 and the disulphides were 
obtained between 10 and 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of amifostine 
in mice, with the lowest concentrations in tumour tissues. Because WR-1065 gives 
protection to normal tissues rather than rescue, the pharmacokinetic data 
indicate that amifostine must be given shortly before administration of the 
cytostatic drug or radiation from which protection is required. For these 
reasons, amifostine is given to patients as a 15-min i.v. infusion before 
cisplatin and carboplatin to protect against their dose-limiting toxicities. In 
some regimens carboplatin is combined with three doses of amifostine because of 
the high concentration of the active carboplatin species during the first 4 h 
after administration. When carboplatin was administered as a 15-min i.v. 
infusion of 400 mg/m2 and amifostine as a 15-min i.v. infusion of 740 mg/m2 just 
before and 2 and 4 h after carboplatin, the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve for ultrafilterable platinum increased from 253 +/- 45 
microM.h (n = 6) for carboplatin alone to 305 +/- 63 microM.h (n = 11) for 
carboplatin+three doses of amifostine. Experiments in nude mice bearing OVCAR-3 
xenografts showed that amifostine, given once before cisplatin or three times in 
combination with carboplatin, did not affect the antitumour effect of these 
drugs. When amifostine was only given just before carboplatin, it even 
stimulated the antitumour effect of carboplatin significantly."
8977117,"Sycamore suspension cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) were grown in the presence of 
sublethal concentrations of copper (50 microM). During the first 5-6 days of 
treatment, growth was not affected, but cell respiration (coupled and uncoupled) 
declined to approximately 60% of its normal value. This decline of respiration 
was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in 
copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of 
(1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome 
oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase 
activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. In addition, the 
mitochondria extracted from copper-treated cells presented the same properties 
as those from control cells, concerning substrate oxidation, cardiolipin and 
cytochrome aa3 contents, and fumarase activity. These results strongly suggest 
that copper triggered an arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis, which preceded cell 
division arrest."
8977381,"Thyroid hormone (T3) increases the transcription of the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) gene (SERCA 2) through three thyroid 
hormone response elements. The existence of repetitive cis elements with 
different configurations is likely to serve specific functions such as 
interactions with nuclear transcription factors. In addition, the presence of 
different T3 receptor isoforms (T3Rs) may contribute to another level of 
complexity in providing specificity for T3 action. In this study, we 
investigated T3R alpha 1-vs. T3R beta 1-specific interactions with the myocyte 
enhancer-specific factor-2 (MEF-2) on the expression of the SERCA 2 gene in 
transient transfection assays in embryonal heart-derived H9c2 cells. MEF-2a in 
combination with either T3R alpha 1 or T3R beta 1 isoforms resulted in a 
2.5-fold increase in SERCA 2 transgene expression in the absence of T3. Addition 
of T3 did not induce any further increase in SERCA 2 expression when T3R alpha 1 
and MEF-2a expression vectors were cotransfected. In contrast, in the presence 
of T3R beta 1 and MEF-2, the addition of T3 increased chlorampenicol 
acetyltransferase activity by an additional 2.2-fold to a total 5.5-fold 
increase. The interaction between MEF-2a and T3R is transcription factor 
specific because another factor that binds to MEF-2 consensus sites (heart 
factor 1b) was not able to interact with T3R. In addition, MEF-2a failed to 
interact with other nuclear factors (cAMP response element-binding protein and 
Egr-1) that stimulate SERCA 2 gene transcription. In addition, we found that a 
single homologous thyroid hormone response element is not able to mediate the 
interactions between MEF-2a and T3Rs to increase SERCA 2 gene transcription. Our 
findings point to T3R isoform-specific interactions with a cell type-specific 
transcription factor (MEF-2) in the regulation of SERCA 2 gene expression."
8978813,"This study provides a three-dimensional (3D) analysis of differences between the 
3D morphology of active and inactive human X interphase chromosomes (Xa and Xi 
territories). Chromosome territories were painted in formaldehyde-fixed, 
three-dimensionally intact human diploid female amniotic fluid cell nuclei (46, 
XX) with X-specific whole chromosome compositive probes. The colocalization of a 
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-stained Barr body with one of the 
two painted X territories allowed the unequivocal discrimination of the inactive 
X from its active counterpart. Light optical serial sections were obtained with 
a confocal laser scanning microscope. 3D-reconstructed Xa territories revealed a 
flatter shape and exhibited a larger and more irregular surface when compared to 
the apparently smoother surface and rounder shape of Xi territories. The 
relationship between territory surface and volume was quantified by the 
determination of a dimensionless roundness factor (RF). RF and surface area 
measurements showed a highly significant difference between Xa and Xi 
territories (P < 0.001) in contrast to volume differences (P > 0.1). For 
comparison with an autosome of similar DNA content, chromosome 7 territories 
were additionally painted. The 3D morphology of the chromosome 7 territories was 
similar to the Xa territory but differed strongly from the Xi territory with 
respect to RF and surface area (P < 0.001)."

presents the clinicopathologic findings of an otherwise healthy infant with 
ipsilateral arteriovenous and capillary hemangiomas of the face and uveal tract, 
microphthalmos, iris heterochromia, hypotony, and absence of central nervous

8982144,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a genetic disorder of unknown etiology. 
Scoliosis is a clinical feature of inherited connective-tissue disorders 
including Marfan syndrome. Mutations within the gene of FBN1 (fibrillin 15), a 
component of the extracellular matrix, are now linked to Marfan syndrome and 
similar clinical phenotypes. This study investigated the potential association 
of structural genes encoding for extracellular matrix components of FBN1, 
elastin, and one of the polypeptides of type-I collagen (COL1A2) with familial 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Eleven pedigrees, including 96 individuals, 
were identified in which adolescent idiopathic scoliosis segregated in an 
apparent autosomal dominant pattern. Fifty-two individuals were determined to be 
affected with scoliosis. Genomic DNA was analyzed by genetic linkage utilizing 
four intragenic markers for the structural genes of FBN1, elastin, and COL1A2. 
Collectively, our results exclude the structural genes of FBN1, elastin, and 
COL1A2 as candidate genes within these families. However, when viewed 
individually, specific markers cannot be excluded within all of the families. 
This information complements previously reported data that fibrillin production 
and matrix incorporation from scoliotic fibroblasts in vitro are normal in more 
than 80% of patients studied."
8982420,"The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation of 
burning in the oral cavity, without clinical signs. Causal factors may be 
psychogenic, systemic or local. The aim of the study was to determine the 
significance of contact allergy in the pathogenesis of burning mouth syndrome. 
Fifteen patients with burning mouth syndrome were studied through anamnesis and 
laboratory analysis. Epicutaneous patch tests were performed with the Italian 
standard series (GIRDCA - Gruppo Italiano di Ricerca Dermatiti da Contatto ed 
Ambientali), preservative and dental series. The same tests were carried out in 
12 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects. The number of patients affected by 
burning mouth syndrome with a positive reaction to patchtesting was 6 out of 15, 
while the number of allergic patients in the control group was 3 out of 12. No 
association could be found between positive reaction at patchtesting and 
exposure to allergens. Contact allergy in burning mouth syndrome seems not to 
play a primary role; nevertheless, it is advisable to perform patch tests in 
selected patients to identify a possible aetiological agent."
8985498,"Mucometrocolpos is the distention of the uterus and vagina caused by obstruction

McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS), including postaxial polydactyly and congenital 
heart disease as main findings. The diagnosis may be difficult when the presence 
of additional findings creates an overlap with other syndromes. We report on a 
female infant with mucometrocolpos, postaxial polydactyly, congenital heart

clinicopathological findings are described and discussed in the context of the 
phenotypic spectrums of MKS and mucometrocolpos concomitant with Ellis van

8985564,"The hearing complaints in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome were studied by 
use of the open-ended hearing problem questionnaire. The main findings are that 
complaints were commonly focused on the categories of 'live speech' and 
'electronic speech' difficulties in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome, 
particularly the auditory difficulties of speech in noise and group 
conversation. However, they reported problems with warning signals significantly 
less frequently than a control 'audiological rehabilitation' group and the 
patients studied by Barcham and Stephens (1980). In addition, main psychological 
problems were related to anxiety (e.g. irritability, nervousness and moodiness) 
in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome. The open-ended hearing problem 
questionnaire appears to be a useful tool that can be used to high-light the 
speech hearing disability encountered by patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome."
8985605,"A novel theory of primary olfactory reception is described. It proposes that 
olfactory receptors respond not to the shape of the molecules but to their 
vibrations. It differs from previous vibrational theories (Dyson, Wright) in 
providing a detailed and plausible mechanism for biological transduction of 
molecular vibrations: inelastic electron tunnelling. Elements of the tunnelling 
spectroscope are identified in putative olfactory receptors and their associated 
G-protein. Means of calculating electron tunnelling spectra of odorant molecules 
are described. Several examples are given of correlations between tunnelling 
spectrum and odour in structurally unrelated molecules. As predicted, molecules 
of very similar shape but differing in vibrations smell different. The most 
striking instance is that of pure acetophenone and its fully deuterated analogue 
acetophenone-d8, which smell different despite being identical in structure. 
This fact cannot, it seems, be explained by structure-based theories of odour. 
The evidence presented here suggests instead that olfaction, like colour vision 
and hearing, is a spectral sense."
8985734,"The deletion of 3bp at codon positions 2642-2645 (delta 2642) of the gene 
mutated in Huntington's disease (HD) was analysed on the normal (N) and HD 
chromosomes of 79 French families affected with HD, and previously typed for the 
(CAG)n repeats. delta 2642 Polymorphism has been found over-represented on HD 
chromosomes, the relative risk of HD with the deletion being at a value of 8.26. 
In this study, the presence of the deleted allele on HD chromosomes increases 
the (CAG)n number (47.93 +/- 1.80 versus 43.50 +/- 2.78) and decreases the age 
of onset (41.34 +/- 2.09 versus 36.90 +/- 2.41) in the patients with versus 
without delta 2642; so the deletion may add to the severity of the disease. Our 
studies of delta 2642 on N chromosomes confirm that the deletion event occurs on 
N chromosomes with a (CAG)n allele length at the upper end of the normal size 
range."
8986634,"Gaucher disease, resulting from the decreased activity of the lysosomal enzyme 
glucocerebrosidase, is the most prevalent sphingolipid storage disease. Due to 
considerable heterogeneity of phenotypic expression, it has been subdivided into 
the nonneurological type 1 disease, and types 2 and 3, the neurological types. 
We describe homozygosity for the D409H mutation within the glucocerebrosidase 
gene associated with a unique form of type 3 Gaucher disease. Twelve patients, 
originating from three Arab sibships, were found to be homozygous for the D409H 
mutation. They all presented with oculomotor apraxia and a progressive cardiac 
valve defect with minimal organomegaly. When expressed in human cells in tissue 
culture, using the T7/EMC/vaccinia virus hybrid expression system, we were able 
to demonstrate that the mRNA carrying the D409H mutation was less stable than 
the normal counterpart. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the mutated 
protein exhibited lower stability than the normal counterpart. Its activity 
toward the artificial substrate 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucopyranoside was 
similar to that of the mutated enzymes carrying the N370S or the L444P 
mutations. However, in loading experiments using lissamine-rhodamine conjugated 
glucosyl ceramide as a substrate, the recombinant mutated protein carrying the 
D409H mutation exhibited 28.63 +/- 6.05% of the activity exhibited by the normal 
enzyme. L444P and N370S mutations exhibited 51.90 +/- 7.16 and 115.75 +/- 12.64% 
of normal enzyme activity, respectively. Loading of cells homozygous for the 
D409H mutation demonstrated 10. 05% of the activity shown by normal cells. L444P 
and N370S homozygous cells demonstrated 25.3 and 98.5% of foreskin fibroblast 
glucocerebrosidase activity, respectively. We demonstrate that homozygosity for 
the D409H mutation is a unique case of a peculiar phenotype associated with a 
specific intracellular glucocerebrosidase activity."
8987005,"The familial occurrence of duodenal atresia is uncommon. This study evaluated 
the inheritance patterns, the nature and associations, and the presence of 
immunologic deficits in duodenal atresia recurring in at least three siblings 
each in two nonrelated families. In the first family, an association with 
Fanconi's anemia was observed in three of seven pregnancies (2 boys, 1 girl) 
suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. Patients died as a 
result of overwhelming (fungal) septicemia in association with pancytopenia. In 
a second family, identical multiple atresias occurred in two female siblings 
born 18 months apart and a third child with a duodenal stenosis. Overwhelming 
sepsis and a T-cell dysfunction was seen in the postoperative period, which had 
partially corrected by follow-up at 5 months. A history of family occurrence of 
duodenal atresia should alert the physician to the possibility of associated 
pathology including immune deficiency states."
8987247,"Central to most hypotheses of the mechanism of idiosyncratic drug-induced blood 
dyscrasias is the involvement of reactive metabolites. In view of the reactive 
nature of the majority of such metabolites, it is likely that they are formed 
by, or in close proximity to the blood cells affected. The major oxidative 
system of neutrophils generates hypochlorous acid. We have demonstrated that the 
drugs associated with the highest incidence of agranulocytosis are oxidized to 
reactive metabolites by hypochlorous acid and/or activated neutrophils. There 
are many mechanisms by which such reactive metabolites could induce 
agranulocytosis. In the case of aminopyrine-induced agranulocytosis, most cases 
appear to involve drug-dependent anti-neutrophil antibodies, and these are 
likely to be induced by cell membrane antigens modified by the reactive 
metabolite of aminopyrine. The target of agranulocytosis associated with many 
other drugs is usually neutrophil precursors and may involve cytotoxicity or a 
cell-mediated immune reaction induced by a reactive metabolite. In the case of 
aplastic anaemia, there is evidence in some cases for involvement of cytotoxic T 
cells, which could either be induced by metabolites generated by neutrophils, or 
more likely, by reactive metabolites generated by stem cells."
8988166,"Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders 
of craniosynostosis in humans and is characterized by craniofacial and limb 
anomalies. The locus for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome maps to chromosome 7p21-p22. 
We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a 
candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant 
phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen 
phenotype. We mapped TWIST to human chromosome 7p21-p22 and mutational analysis 
reveals nonsense, missense, insertion and deletion mutations in patients. These 
mutations occur within the basic DNA binding, helix I and loop domains, or 
result in premature termination of the protein. Studies in Drosophila indicate 
that twist may affect the transcription of fibroblast growth factor receptors 
(FGFRs), another gene family implicated in human craniosynostosis. The emerging 
cascade of molecular components involved in craniofacial and limb development 
now includes TWIST, which may function as an upstream regulator of FGFRs."
8988167,"Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalo-syndactyly type III, ACS III) is an 
autosomal dominant craniosynostosis with brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly 
and facial dysmorphism including ptosis, facial asymmetry and prominent ear 
crura. ACS III has been mapped to chromosome 7p21-22. Of interest, TWIST, the 
human counterpart of the murine Twist gene, has been localized on chromosome 
7p21 as well. The Twist gene product is a transcription factor containing a 
basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) domain, required in head mesenchyme for cranial 
neural tube morphogenesis in mice. The co-localisation of ACS III and TWIST 
prompted us to screen ACS III patients for TWIST gene mutations especially as 
mice heterozygous for Twist null mutations displayed skull defects and 
duplication of hind leg digits. Here, we report 21-bp insertions and nonsense 
mutations of the TWIST gene (S127X, E130X) in seven ACS III probands and 
describe impairment of head mesenchyme induction by TWIST as a novel 
pathophysiological mechanism in human craniosynostoses."
8989517,"We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho 
homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears 
to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence 
for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding 
sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein, 
followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of 
both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ 
hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous 
system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to 
Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a 
conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic 
helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also 
consistently detected in epithelial structures undergoing mesenchyme induction."
8990390,"Potential female donors frequently ask whether unilateral nephrectomy will 
impair future childbearing capabilities. To address this question, we surveyed 
220 women who underwent donor nephrectomy between 1985 and 1992. Of the 144 
women who responded, 33 became pregnant after donation for a total of 45 
pregnancies. Seventy-five percent of the pregnancies were carried to term 
without difficulty. Complications incurred during gestation included miscarriage 
(13.3%), preeclampsia (4.4%), gestational hypertension (4.4%), proteinuria 
(4.4%), and tubal pregnancy (2.2%). Four of the 45 pregnancies (excluding 
miscarriages) required preterm hospitalization, resulting in an overall 
morbidity of 8.8%. There were no pregnancy-related deaths, and no fetal 
abnormalities were reported. Problems with persistent hypertension, proteinuria, 
or changes in renal function were not noted. None of the above complications 
exceeded what has been noted for the general population. Infertility was a 
problem in 8.3% (3/36) of our respondents, compared with a worldwide incidence 
of 16.7%. Based on these results, we conclude that donor nephrectomy is not 
detrimental to the prenatal course or outcome of future pregnancies."
8995352,"HERG (human eag-related gene) encodes an inward-rectifier potassium channel 
formed by the assembly of four subunits. Since the truncated HERG protein in 
patients with long QT syndrome induces a dominant phenotype, that is, cardiac 
sudden death, the assembly of nonfunctional complexes between wild-type and 
mutated subunits was implicated in causing the disease. To understand 
HERG-mediated cardiac sudden death at the molecular level, it is important to 
determine which regions in the HERG protein participate in subunit interaction. 
We therefore report the identification of a subunit interaction domain, 
NAB(HERG), that is localized at the hydrophilic cytoplasmic N terminus and can 
form a tetramer in the absence of the rest of the HERG protein. Truncated HERG 
proteins containing NAB(HERG), including one that resulted from the delta1261 
human mutation, inhibit the functional expression of the HERG channel in 
transfected cells. Together, these results support the notion that the 
expression of HERG in the human heart may be decreased in the presence of the 
truncated subunit. Such a decrease of potassium channel expression can 
contribute to the longer QT intervals observed in the patients with the HERG 
mutation."
8996519,"PURPOSE: Topoisomerase II alpha content, topoisomerase II catalytic activity and 
drug sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors, doxorubicin and 
etoposide, were examined in a panel of 14 unselected human lung cancer cell 
lines in order to determine the relationship between topoisomerase II and drug 
sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors.
METHODS: Drug sensitivities were determined using a microculture tetrazolium 
assay. The topoisomerase II alpha levels were determined by Western blot 
analysis and the topoisomerase II catalytic activity was determined using a 
decatenation assay of kinetoplast DNA, using nuclear protein from cells of each 
cell line.
RESULTS: Drug sensitivity tests revealed that small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell 
lines were more sensitive to drugs than non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. The relative topoisomerase II alpha levels and relative topoisomerase II 
catalytic activity from SCLC cell lines (mean +/- SD 0.89 +/- 0.54 and 5.3 +/- 
3.4, respectively) were slightly higher than those from NSCLC cell lines (0.78 
+/- 0.56 and 4.0 +/- 2.8, respectively), but the differences were not 
statistically significant, and not sufficient to account for the variation in 
drug sensitivities. Moreover, no clear association was observed between the 
topoisomerase II alpha levels or the topoisomerase II catalytic activity and 
drug sensitivities in the cell lines studied.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the difference in drug sensitivities to 
doxorubicin and etoposide in human lung cancer cell lines might not be 
explainable by the topoisomerase II alpha levels and topoisomerase II catalytic 
activity. Moreover, our results suggest that the topoisomerase II alpha levels 
and topoisomerase II catalytic activity may play a minor role in the 
determination of clinical drug resistance of human lung cancers."

superior border of the orbit were seen on the X-ray study of the head. Atrophy 
of the right cerebrum and cerebral peduncle was seen on magnetic resonance 
imaging. These findings suggest that hemiatrophy of the brain was responsible 
for total hemiatrophy of the body in this patient. The etiology of cerebral 
hemiatrophy is not known. There is only a report of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson 
syndrome accompanied with total hemiatrophy."
8998528,"Most of the children with Di George syndrome and 60% of patients with 
velocardiofacial syndrome exhibit a microdeletion within chromosome 22q11. The 
phenotypic expression of this chromosomal abnormality is highly variable.
PATIENTS: Forty-nine children, 0 to 15 years of age, were demonstrated as 
carriers of a 22q11 microdeletion. The main referral diagnoses were: Di George 
syndrome (19 cases), velocardiofacial syndrome (14 cases); congenital heart 
defect with dysmorphism (9 cases); hypoparathyroidism (2 cases). The 
microdeletion was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes 
specific of the 22q11 region.
RESULTS: Facial dysmorphism was the only constant feature. A congenital heart 
defect was present in 84% of cases. Significant hypocalcemia was documented in 
51% of cases and thymic hypo or agenesis in 83%. Significant immune deficiency 
was documented in nine cases. The most frequent associated defects were urinary 
tract malformations (8 cases). A cleft palate was present in height enfants but 
velopharyngeal insufficiency was almost constant. Two-thirds of children had 
psychomotor delay, and five children exhibited behavioral problems. Of the 35 
couples of parents tested, eight mothers were found to be carriers of the 
deletion.
CONCLUSION: For the pediatrician, it is essential to know the variability of the 
clinical picture. The long-term prognosis is conditioned by the possibility of 
mental retardation and learning disabilities. Parents should be tested for the 
presence of the deletion. The occurrence of the microdeletion in asymptomatic 
relatives raises difficult problems in genetic counselling."
8999876,"Transcription is coupled to repair in Escherichia coli and in humans. Proteins 
encoded by the mfd gene in E. coli and by the ERCC6/CSB gene in humans, both of 
which possess the so-called helicase motifs, are required for the coupling 
reaction. It has been shown that the Mfd protein is an ATPase but not a helicase 
and accomplishes coupling, in part, by disrupting the ternary complex of E. coli 
RNA polymerase stalled at the site of DNA damage. In this study we overproduced 
the human CSB protein using the baculovirus vector and purified and 
characterized the recombinant protein. CSB has an ATPase activity that is 
stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it 
dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans 
different from that in prokaryotes. CSB is a DNA-binding protein, and it also 
binds to XPA, TFIIH, and the p34 subunit of TFIIE. These interactions are likely 
to play a role in recruiting repair proteins to ternary complexes formed at 
damage sites."
9001190,"This study investigated the response of TSH secretion to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine 
(T3) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) in patients with resistance to 
thyroid hormone, and compared the responses with those in patients with 
TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and normal subjects. A short-term administration 
of 75 microg of T3 daily for 7 days suppressed serum TSH concentrations almost 
completely in normal subjects, but suppressed TSH only partially in patients 
with resistance to thyroid hormone and TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. A 
single-dose administration of 75 microg of T3 gave similar results in regard to 
TSH suppressibility in these three subjects groups. In contrast, a single-dose 
administration of 1.4 mg of Triac remarkably suppressed serum TSH concentrations 
after 2 hours in not only normal subjects (-34 +/- 11% [mean +/- SD] from the 
basal value) but also in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (-31 +/- 
9%), and this TSH suppression continued for 4 hours. After 24 hours, this TSH 
suppression persisted in normal subjects (-62 +/- 12%) but was relieved in 
patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (-23 +/- 14%). After the Triac 
administration, molar ratios of alpha-subunit to TSH in serum were decreased in 
patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma but increased in patients with 
resistance to thyroid hormone. Because the Triac therapy for patients with 
resistance to thyroid hormone suppressed pituitary-TSH secretion during the 
early phase of drug ingestion, this drug should be given several times within a 
day to obtain continuous TSH-suppressive effects."
9002682,"Dominantly acting, allelic mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 
(FGFR2) gene have been described in five craniosynostosis syndromes. In Apert 
syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations 
of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker 
between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been 
documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals. We have identified three 
novel mutations of this dipeptide, associated with distinct phenotypes. A C-->T 
mutation that predicts a Ser252Leu substitution, ascertained in a boy with mild 
Crouzon syndrome (craniosynostosis with normal limbs) is also present in three 
clinically normal members of his family. A CG-->TT mutation that predicts a 
Ser252Phe substitution results in a phenotype consistent with Apert syndrome. 
Finally, a CGC-->TCT mutation that predicts a double amino acid substitution 
(Ser252Phe and Pro253Ser) causes a Pfeiffer syndrome variant with mild 
craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and big toes, fixed extension of several digits, 
and only minimal cutaneous syndactyly. The observation that the Ser252Phe 
mutation causes Apert syndrome, whereas the other single or double substitutions 
are associated with milder or normal phenotypes, highlights the exquisitely 
specific molecular pathogenesis of the limb and craniofacial abnormalities 
associated with Apert syndrome. Ser252Phe is the first noncanonical mutation to 
be identified in this disorder, its rarity being explained by the requirement 
for two residues of the serine codon to be mutated. The description of 
independent, complex nucleotide substitutions involving identical nucleotides is 
unprecedented, and we speculate that this may result from functional selection 
of FGFR mutations in sperm."
9045676,"Metaxin, a novel gene located between the glucocerebrosidase and thrombospondin 
3 genes in the mouse, is essential for survival of the postimplantation mouse 
embryo. In this study, the subcellular location, domain structure, and 
biochemical function of metaxin were investigated. Anti-recombinant metaxin 
antibodies recognized 35- and 70-kDa proteins in mitochondria from various 
tissues; the 35-kDa protein is consistent in size with the predicted translation 
product of metaxin cDNA. When metaxin cDNA was transfected into COS cells, 
immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the protein is located in 
mitochondria. Metaxin contains a putative mitochondrial outer membrane signal 
anchor domain at its C terminus, and a truncated form of metaxin lacking this 
signal anchor domain had a reduced association with mitochondria. In addition, 
metaxin was highly susceptible to proteases in intact mitochondria. We therefore 
conclude that metaxin is a mitochondrial protein that extends into the cytosol 
while anchored into the outer membrane at its C terminus. In its N-terminal 
region, metaxin shows significant sequence identity to Tom37, a component of the 
outer membrane portion of the mitochondrial preprotein translocation apparatus 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but important structural differences, including 
apparently different mechanisms of targeting to membranes, also exist between 
the two proteins. Given the similar subcellular locations of metaxin and Tom37, 
the possible role of metaxin in mitochondrial preprotein import was 
investigated. Antibodies against metaxin, when preincubated with mitochondria, 
partially inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled preadrenodoxin into mitochondria. 
Metaxin is therefore the second mammalian component of the protein translocation 
apparatus of the mitochondrial outer membrane to be characterized at the 
molecular level and the first for which an inherited mutation has been 
described. The early embryonic lethal phenotype of mice lacking metaxin 
demonstrates that efficient import of proteins into mitochondria is crucial for 
cellular survival. The characterization of metaxin provides an opportunity to 
elucidate similarities and possible differences in the mechanisms of protein 
import between fungi and mammals and in the phenotypes of fungi and mammals 
lacking mitochondrial import receptors."
9045856,"A new mouse cardiac electrophysiology method was used to study mice harboring an 
alpha-myosin heavy chain Arg403Gln missense mutation (alpha-MHC403/+), which 
results in histological and hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic of familial 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) and sudden death of uncertain etiology during 
exercise. Wild-type animals had completely normal cardiac electrophysiology. In 
contrast, FHC mice demonstrated (a) electrocardiographic abnormalities including 
prolonged repolarization intervals and rightward axis; (b) electrophysiological 
abnormalities including heterogeneous ventricular conduction properties and 
prolonged sinus node recovery time; and (c) inducible ventricular ectopy. These 
data identify distinct electrophysiologic abnormalities in FHC mice with a 
specific alpha-myosin mutation, and also validate a novel method to explore in 
vivo the relationship between specific genotypes and their electrophysiologic 
phenotypes."
9046114,"A prospective study of 9 patients with plasma cell dyscrasia was performed to 
evaluate the need of plasma exchange (PE) and its possible effect in the acute 
and chronic management of hyperviscosity syndrome. The underlying dyscrasia was 
an IgG myeloma in 5 cases, IgA myeloma in 2 cases, one patient had IgD myeloma 
and in one patient Waldemström's macroglobulinemia was diagnosed. The main 
sequelae of circulatory disturbances, caused by increased blood resistance to 
flow, were fundus alterations (55.6%), neurologic manifestations (88.9%), a 
tendency to bleeding (44.4%) and renal failure (55.6%). In total, 49 PE 
procedures were performed. Following PE, hyperviscosity symptoms improved in 
88.9% of the treated patients. The improvement in neurologic manifestations and 
hematologic complications was very fast, within the first PE session. The effect 
was less evident in ocular fundus alterations. Only one myeloma patient 
developed chronic renal failure. PE is the most effective method in the 
treatment of hyperviscosity syndrome often seen with multiple myeloma and 
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and it is therapy of choice for this 
complication."
9046304,"To test the safety and efficacy of tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 
21-aminosteroid, in improving the outcome of patients with aneurysmal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 902 patients were enrolled in a prospective 
randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial at 54 North American 
neurosurgical centers. Five patients were excluded prior to receiving any study 
drug. Of 897 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 300 
received a placebo containing a citrate vehicle, 298 received 2 mg/kg per day 
tirilazad, and 299 received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad, all administered 
intravenously beginning within 48 hours of the SAH and continuing through 10 
days posthemorrhage. All patients were also treated with orally administered 
nimodipine. At 3 months post-SAH, there were no significant differences (p < 
0.025) among the groups with regard to mortality rate, favorable outcome on the 
Glasgow Outcome Scale, or employment status. During the first 14 days after the 
SAH, there were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or 
severity of clinically symptomatic or angiographically identifiable cerebral 
vasospasm. Mortality data stratified by gender and neurological grade on 
admission (assessed according to a modified World Federation of Neurological 
Surgeons scale) demonstrated that the men with Grades IV to V had a 33% 
mortality rate in the vehicle group, 52% in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad group 
(p = 0.29), and 5% in the 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.03). Tirilazad 
was well tolerated at both dose levels. Tirilazad mesylate at dosage levels of 
up to 6 mg/kg per day for 8 to 10 days following SAH did not improve the overall 
outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH in this trial. The differences in the 
efficacy of tirilazad in this trial and a previously reported trial in Europe, 
Australia, and New Zealand, in which dosage levels of tirilazad of 6 mg/kg per 
day reduced mortality rates and increased good recovery, may be a result of 
differences in admission characteristics of the patients and/or differences in 
management protocols, including the use of anticonvulsant medications."
9048937,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and type 3 (SCA1, SCA3) are autosomal dominant 
neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats in 
novel genes. In our collective of SCA1 and SCA3 families, we observed distortion 
of the Mendelian 1:1 segregation of the disease. The mutated alleles were 
preferentially transmitted by female carriers in SCA3, whereas a gender effect 
on clinical features such as age of onset was not obvious. The mechanism 
underlying segregation distortion remains to be established."
9049316,"To study the activity of the Escherichia coli UvrA and UvrB nucleotide excision 
repair proteins during the formation of the pre-incision complex at a damaged 
DNA site, we used substrates with modifications around a single 
2-(acetylamino)fluorene (AAF) lesion. Based on the release of AAF-containing 
oligonucleotides from a single-stranded DNA circle, we conclude that during 
interaction with our substrates UvrAB introduces changes in DNA which are 
localized at the lesion and are limited to 1-3 bp. Since these changes might 
include a denaturation of DNA at the lesion site and, consequently, a bubble 
structure might be present in a pre-incision complex, we studied incision 
activity of UvrABC excinuclease on substrates with 1-4 unpaired bases next to an 
AAF adduct. Opening more than one base on either or both sides of the lesion 
caused a significant decrease in the incision activity of UvrABC, but did not 
change the position of the incision sites. We conclude that the UvrAB action 
leading to a pre-incision complex does not include the formation of a bubble 
intermediate generated by extensive denaturation of base pairs."
9049317,"The recognition by Escherichia coli Uvr nucleotide excision repair proteins of a 
variety of lesions with diverse chemical structures and the presence of helicase 
activity in the UvrAB complex which can displace short oligonucleotides annealed 
to single-stranded DNA led to a model in which this activity moves UvrAB along 
undamaged DNA to damaged sites where the lesion blocks further translocation and 
the protein-DNA pre-incision complex is formed. To evaluate this mechanism for 
damage recognition, we constructed substrates with oligonucleotides of different 
lengths annealed to single-stranded DNA circles and placed a single 
2-(acetylamino)fluorene (AAF) lesion either on the oligonucleotide or on the 
circle. For the substrates with no lesion, the UvrAB complex effectively 
displaced a 22-mer but not a 27-mer or longer fragments. The presence of AAF on 
the oligonucleotide significantly increased the release of the 27-mer but 
oligomers of 30 or longer were not separated. Placing the lesion on the circular 
strand did not block the release of the fragments. Instead, the releasing 
activity of UvrAB was stimulated and also depended on the length of the annealed 
oligonucleotide. These observations do not agree with the predictions of a 
damage recognition mechanism that depends on helicase-driven translocation. Most 
likely, the strand-separating activity of UvrAB is a consequence of local 
changes occurring during the formation of a DNA-protein pre-incision complex at 
the damaged site and is not due to translocation of the protein along undamaged 
DNA to locate a lesion."
9050052,"Trichothiodystrophy (brittle sulfur-deficient hair) is a marker for several 
autosomal recessive neurocutaneous syndromes with neurological manifestations 
and mental retardation. In Tay syndrome, the trichothiodystrophy is accompanied 
by congenital ichthyosis, short stature, delayed physical and mental development 
and pyramidal tract signs with increase in muscular tone and brisk tendon 
reflexes. The pathogenesis of these neurological manifestations is not fully 
elucidated. We present a case of Tay syndrome in which a cranial MRI revealed an 
almost total lack of myelin within the cerebral hemispheres and a patchy 
hypomyelination of the cerebellum. In accordance, a strongly prolonged visual 
evoked response pointed to a dysfunction of the white matter in Tay syndrome."
9050065,"Pseudomelanosis duodeni is rarely seen in children. It manifests endoscopically 
as peppery speckles in the duodenal mucosa. This pigment corresponds principally 
to accumulation of ferrous sulfide in macrophages within the lamina propria. We 
report the case of a 16-year-old boy with ectodermal dysplasia who underwent 
renal transplantation for vesicoureteral reflux and later developed epigastric 
pain. Endoscopic and pathologic findings in the duodenal mucosa were typical of 
pseudomelanosis duodeni. A review of the literature reveals shared clinical 
features among reported adult and pediatric cases, including chronic renal 
failure, use of antihypertensive medication and oral iron supplementation, 
and/or presence of gastric hemorrhage."
9050085,"Previous work has shown that cholinomimetic drugs induce ""vacuous"" or 
non-directed jaw movements in rats. In the present study, five experiments were 
conducted to provide a pharmacological, anatomical and behavioral 
characterization of tacrine-induced vacuous jaw movements. In the first 
experiment, tacrine produced vacuous chewing in a dose-related manner in a range 
of 1.25 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg. This effect was reduced, also in a dose-related 
manner, by the co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine in a 
range of 0.125 to 1.0 mg/kg, but not by N-methylscopolamine. The fourth 
experiment examined the effect of scopolamine (2.5 to 10.0 micrograms) injected 
into the ventrolateral striatum on vacuous jaw movements induced by 5.0 mg/kg 
tacrine. Intrastriatal injections of scopolamine completely blocked 
tacrine-induced jaw movements. The fifth experiment utilized a slow-motion 
videotaping system to analyze the temporal characteristics of vacuous chewing 
induced by 5.0 mg/kg tacrine. The vast majority of the movements occurred in 
rapid ""bursts,"" and analysis of interresponse times (i.e., the time between each 
jaw movement) showed that most of the jaw movements occurred within a local 
frequency range of 3 to 7 Hz. Thus, tacrine-induced jaw movements are reduced by 
antimuscarinic treatment, and most of these movements occur in the parkinsonian 
tremor frequency range. Tremulous jaw movements induced by tacrine in rats 
appear to share some characteristics with Parkinsonian tremor."
9050876,"N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal (LLnL), which reversibly inhibits the 
proteasome in addition to other proteases, and a more specific irreversible 
inhibitor of the proteasome, lactacystin, were found to cause the accumulation 
of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chains in the cytosol of 
the beta2-microglobulin-deficient cell line Daudi and the TAP-deficient cell 
line .174. These cell lines, which are severely impaired in their ability to 
fold MHC class I heavy chain, showed an accumulation of soluble class I heavy 
chains at different rates over a period of hours in the presence of LLnL. The 
accumulation of soluble class I heavy chains in the presence of either LLnL or 
lactacystin was easily revealed in Daudi and .174 but almost undetectable in a 
Daudi transfectant expressing beta2-microglobulin and in 45.1, the wild-type 
parent of .174. The soluble class I heavy chain was also found to be devoid of 
its N-linked glycan and to be located in the cytosol. When the gene for ICP47, a 
herpes simplex virus protein that blocks the translocation of peptides into the 
endoplasmic reticulum, was transfected into 45.1, a similar accumulation of 
soluble MHC class I heavy chain was detectable. These data suggest that in cells 
where the MHC class I molecule is unable to assemble properly, the misfolded 
heavy chain is removed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, 
deglycosylated, and degraded by the proteasome."
9050924,"Down's syndrome results from the production of three copies of chromosome 21 
within a cell. We have devised a method termed the homologous gene quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (HGQ-PCR), which uses one pair of primers and which 
can directly identify the additional copy of chromosome 21 by simultaneously 
amplifying two highly homologous genes of the human liver-type 
phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 21 (PFKL-CH21) and the human 
muscle-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 1 (PFKM-CH1) for 
self-detecting determination. On analysis of 34 cases of Down's syndrome, 
including two cases of unbalanced translocation 46, XY, der (14; 21) (q10; q10), 
+ 21, and 100 normal individuals, the relative ratio of the PFKM-CH1/PFKL-CH21 
product was 1.33 +/- 0.323 (mean +/- SD) and 0.40 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- SD) for 
disomy DNA and trisomy DNA, respectively. The difference between these two 
groups was highly significant (P < 0.001). These results indicate that this 
quantitative method is practical and may be used for the prenatal diagnosis of 
Down's syndrome caused by trisomy 21."
9053479,"PURPOSE: One hundred thirty of 2,792 patients (5%) registered on three 
Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study clinical trials (IRS-I, -II, and -III) from 
1972 to 1991 had an extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EOE). We report here the 
results of multimodality therapy for this tumor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 130 patients were less than 21 years of age; 70 (54%) 
were males. Primary tumor sites were on the trunk in 41 patients, an extremity 
in 34, the head/neck in 23, the retroperitoneum/pelvis in 21, and other sites in 
11. One hundred fourteen patients had no metastases at diagnosis. In 21 
patients, the tumor was completely resected; in 30, the localized or regional 
tumor was grossly resected, and in 63 patients, grossly visible sarcoma was left 
behind. Sixteen patients (12%) had distant metastases at diagnosis. All patients 
were given multiagent chemotherapy and most received irradiation (XRT); none 
were treated with bone marrow transplantation.
RESULTS: One hundred seven patients (82%) achieved a complete response. At 10 
years, 62%, 61%, and 77% of the patients were alive after treatment on IRS-I, 
IRS-II, or IRS-III therapeutic protocols, respectively, similar to figures 
obtained in all IRS patients. At last follow-up evaluation, 42 patients had died 
of progressive tumor and one of infection. Survival at 10 years was most likely 
for patients with tumor that arose in the head and neck, extremities, and trunk, 
and for those who underwent grossly complete tumor removal before initiation of 
chemotherapy. For patients with localized, gross residual tumor, adding 
doxorubicin (DOX) to the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, 
cyclophosphamide (VAC), and XRT did not significantly improve survival in 39 
patients (62% alive at 10 years) compared with that of 24 patients treated with 
VAC and XRT without DOX (65% alive at 10 years, P = .93).
CONCLUSION: This series indicated that EOE in children is similar to 
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in its response to multimodal treatment. No benefit was 
apparent from the addition of DOX to VAC chemotherapy in patients with gross 
residual EOE."
9056561,"The beta-thalassemia syndromes are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders 
characterized by reduced or absent expression of the beta-globin gene. To date, 
over 300 beta-thalassemia alleles have been characterized in or around the 
beta-globin region. Thalassemia major is severe anemia necessitating chronic 
blood transfusions, splenectomy, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow 
transplantation. Usually thalassemia major results from homozygosity or compound 
heterozygosity for severe betaO- and/or beta+-thalassemia mutations. Thalassemia 
intermedia is a clinical diagnosis that describes a symptomatic but less severe 
condition than beta-thalassemia major. beta-thalassemia intermedia may arise 
from several different combinations of alpha- and/or beta-thalassemia mutations. 
Heterozygous beta-thalassemia is typically characterized by a mild microcytic 
hypochromic anemia without any significant clinical implications. In this 
report, we describe a 63-year-old Africian American woman with asymptomatic 
homozygous beta-thalassemia, who seems to carry 2 copies of the -29 mutation in 
the promoter region of the beta-globin gene. Her elevated hemoglobin F level of 
83% was associated with heterozygosity for the Xmn I polymorphism upstream of 
the Ggamma-globin gene. Southern blot analysis at the alpha-globin locus did not 
show any deletion that would account for the mildness of her phenotype. 
Therefore, homozygosity for the -29 mutation along with the Xmn I polymorphism 
appears to confer an extremely mild beta-thalassemia phenotype. This observation 
has important implications in the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of 
families segregating this type of genetic defect."
9060446,"Mast cells are one of the major effector cells in the pathogenesis of the 
immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction in a number of non-allergic immune 
disorders as well as in normal physiological processes. In addition, it has been 
shown recently that mast cells also play a significant role in a life-saving 
host response to bacterial reactions. But as much as the immunopathological role 
of mast cells has been acknowledged, these cells have also aroused much 
controversy and confusion. By now it is clear that one explanation for the 
sometimes even contradictory opinions on mast cell function arise from mast cell 
heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can express itself as differences in 
histochemical, biochemical, and functional characteristics. In vitro systems 
provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the basic mechanisms for mast 
cell development and differentiation and helped to demonstrate that mast cell 
heterogeneity can be traced back to certain cytokine patterns that are present 
in different microenvironments. In this context it has also been shown that the 
growth factors required for human mast cell differentiation are somewhat 
different than those for rodents. In rodents, the atypical, T cell-dependent 
mucosal type mast cell can be distinguished from the T cell-independent 
connective tissue-type mast cell. In humans, the strict classification into 
mucosal and connective tissue-type mast cells is not possible and the content of 
mast cell-specific proteases chymase and tryptase is the main criterion for mast 
cell subtypes in humans. The large quantities of tryptase and chymase that are 
synthesized by mast cells suggest and emphasize the significance of these 
proteinases in mast cell function and stimulated investigations about the 
biological properties of these mast cell-specific proteases. Comparing their 
biological activities it becomes clear that they share some activities. On the 
other hand, tryptase seems to participate in proinflammatory mast cell function, 
whereas chymase seems to be more involved in inflammatory reactions. This review 
provides a short overview of the discovery, origin, development, and biological 
significance of mast cells and will then concentrate on mast cell heterogeneity 
in rodents and humans with respect to the mast cell proteases tryptase and 
chymase and their function."
9061614,"The expression of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the adrenal medulla is 
upregulated in parallel by stress and pharmacological treatments. In this study 
we examined whether a neuropeptide and its processing enzyme are regulated in 
parallel with catecholamine enzyme genes after drug treatment. Because the main 
effect of stress on the adrenal medulla is via splanchnic nerve stimulation of 
nicotinic receptors, we used nicotine to stimulate the medulla and visualized 
expression of catecholamine enzyme genes, the medullary peptide neuropeptide Y 
(NPY), and the neuropeptide-processing enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating 
monooxygenase (PAM) by in situ hybridization quantified by image analysis of 
autoradiographic images. Rats received a single injection of nicotine (0, 1, or 
5 mg/kg sc). Six hours later, rats were transcardially perfused. Free-floating 
adrenal gland sections were hybridized with 35S-labeled cDNA probes for tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), phenylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase (PNMT), PAM, and NPY. Nicotine treatment upregulated the 
expression of TH, PNMT, and NPY genes in a dose-dependent fashion. Small but 
nonsignificant increases were observed in DBH and PAM mRNA levels. These results 
suggest that common transcriptional activation mechanisms may upregulate both 
catecholamine and neuropeptide synthesis in the adrenal medulla after nicotinic 
stimulation."
9063489,"Metastasis is the major obstacle in cancer therapy. Lung cancer is divided into 
4 histological groups, such as small cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, representing different clinical 
behaviors. Novel metastasis models of human lung cancer cells to the liver, 
kidneys and lymph nodes were established in SCID mice depleted of NK cells. In 
the model under study, small-cell carcinoma cells mainly formed lymph-node 
metastases, while squamous cell carcinoma cells mainly metastasized to the liver 
and kidneys. Moreover, adenocarcinoma cells formed lung metastases and malignant 
pleural effusion. These findings suggest that our model reflects clinical 
behavior of metastatic lung cancer and is useful for evaluation of 
antimetastatic modalities."
9063691,"Electrically-induced twitch responses of the prostatic segment of vas deferens 
(0.1 Hz, 65 V, 1 ms) are mainly due to the transient presynaptic release of ATP, 
which acts postsynaptically on non-adrenergic receptors to contract smooth 
muscle cells. These responses were fully blocked by nanomolar concentrations of 
the omega-conotoxins GVIA, MVIIA, and MVIIC, most likely by inhibiting Ca2+ 
entry through presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels controlling the release of ATP. 
Repeated washout of the toxins allowed the recovery of contractions, except for 
omega-conotoxin GVIA, whose inhibitory effects remained unchanged for at least 
60 min. In addition, micromolar concentrations of omega-conotoxin MVIIC were 
unable to protect against the irreversible inhibition of twitch contractions 
induced by nanomolar concentrations of omega-conotoxin GVIA. At low 
extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (1.5 mM), 20 nM of omega-conotoxin GVIA or 
MVIIA inhibited completely the twitch contractions in about 10 min. In 5 mM Ca2+ 
the blockade of twitch contractions after 10 min was 70% for both toxins. In 1.5 
mM Ca2+ omega-conotoxin MVIIC (1 microM) inhibited completely the twitch 
contraction after 10 min. In 5 mM Ca2+ blockade developed very slowly and was 
very poor after 30 min, omega-conotoxin MVIIC depressed the response by only 
20%. These results are compatible with the idea that the three omega-conotoxins 
block the purinergic neurotransmission of the vas deferens by acting on 
presynaptic N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. However, omega-conotoxin 
MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin 
GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for 
binding to their receptors."
9063734,"Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized 
by classical lissencephaly and a characteristic facies. It is associated with 
visible or submicroscopic deletions within chromosome band 17p13.3. 
Lissencephaly without facial dysmorphism has also been observed and is referred 
to as isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). Apparently partial and 
non-overlapping deletions of the 5' or 3' end of a candidate gene LIS1 in one 
ILS and one MDS patient had suggested that MDS was a single gene disorder, and 
that LIS1 spans in excess of 400 kb. However, the originally presumed 5' end of 
LIS1 was found to belong to the 14-33 epsilon gene residing more distally on 
17p13.3. We have now isolated the correct 5' end of LIS1, constructed a 
approximately 500 kb genomic contig encompassing LIS1, and estimated its gene to 
be approximately 80 kg. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of an ILS 
patient with a de novo balanced translocation, as well as analysis of several 
other key MDS and ILS deletion patients, localizes the lissencephaly critical 
region within the LIS1 gene. Therefore, LIS1 remains the strongest candidate 
gene for the lissencephaly phenotype in ILS and MDS. Our analyses also suggest 
that additional genes distal to LIS1 may be responsible for the facial 
dysmorphology and other abnormalities seen in MDS but not in ILS patients, 
supporting our original concept MDS as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome."
9064551,"M. Linehan developed ""dialectical behavioral therapy"" specifically to treat 
chronically suicidal borderline patients. It rests on a biosocial model that 
assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress. The 
numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, 
inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as 
attempts at problem-solving. This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing 
balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both 
an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them. 
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a 
wide choice of therapeutic strategies. Parallel to development of the therapy 
itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the 
manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation. An initial 
controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this 
method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels. In the current 
endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality 
disorders, ""dialectical behavioral therapy"" is a noteworthy model."
9065408,"In humans, DNA lesions such as pyrimidine dimers in the template strand of genes 
transcribed by RNA polymerase II are repaired faster than those in the coding 
strand and nontranscribed regions of the genome. This phenomenon, referred to as 
transcription-coupled repair (i) requires active transcription, (ii) does not 
require the XPC gene product which is essential for general/basal repair 
reactions, and (iii) requires the CSA and CSB proteins. We have developed an in 
vitro model system that consists of purified human excision repair factors and a 
DNA substrate analogous to a transcription bubble terminating at a cyclobutane 
thymine dimer. In this system the thymine dimer was excised independent of XPC. 
Furthermore, the thymine dimer in the bubble-containing substrate was removed 
approximately 3-fold faster by the excision repair nuclease reconstituted with 
or without XPC, compared with the removal of thymine dimer from a base paired 
duplex by the entire set of excision nuclease factors. These results provide 
important insight into the mechanism of transcription-coupled repair in humans."
9068910,"BACKGROUND: Marfan's syndrome is an inherited disorder of connective tissue 
associated with characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, ocular, and 
cardiovascular systems. Marked clinical variability and age dependency of all 
manifestations of Marfan's syndrome may render the unequivocal diagnosis 
difficult in mildly affected, young subjects.
HYPOTHESIS: The study and care of a 32-year-old woman with evidence of Marfan's 
syndrome, several cardiac abnormalities, and paranoid schizophrenia led to an 
investigation of her consenting relatives to verify the penetrance of Marfan's 
syndrome and the degree of comorbidity between the disease and psychiatric 
disorders.
METHODS: The patient and 12 subjects belonging to three generations of her 
family underwent cardiovascular, skeletal, ophthalmologic, and psychiatric 
examinations. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed.
RESULTS: One female index patient and six of her first-degree relatives were 
found to be affected by Marfan's syndrome. All seven patients were found to have 
mitral valve prolapse associated with other cardiac abnormalities. Four of these 
patients were affected by the following psychiatric disorders: generalized 
anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, paranoid schizophrenia (two cases). 
Six more relatives without Marfan's syndrome showed mitral valve prolapse in 
association with other echocardiographic features. Two of these were found to be 
affected by a major depressive disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: The present data support the hypothesis that a psychiatric 
condition, associated with a significantly high frequency of cardiac 
involvement, may be part of the phenotype of Marfan's syndrome."
9069051,"A report of three cases of craniosynostosis in X-linked hypophosphataemic 
rickets (XLH) is presented. The literature is reviewed, suggesting that 
craniosynostosis is relatively common in XLH and that boys may be more at risk 
than girls. It is recommended that radiological screening be offered to all 
patients with XLH."
9069582,"To determine the biochemical and related functional effects of the thyroid 
analog diiodothyroproprionic acid (DITPA) on primate myocardium, we examined, 
both before and after 23 days of DITPA (3.75 mg/kg): myosin heavy-chain (MHC) 
isoforms and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling proteins; left 
ventricular (LV) function; and the LV force-frequency relation in four baboons 
chronically instrumented with sonomicrometers and micromanometers. The 
force-frequency relation was measured as the response of isovolumic contraction 
(dP/dtmax) to incremental pacing and the critical heart rate (HRcrit) as the 
rate at which dP/dtmax reached its maximum. DITPA increased basal LV dPt/dtmax 
(3,300 +/- 378 versus 2,943 +/- 413 mm Hg/sec; p = .09), and velocity of 
circumferential shortening (1.13 +/- 0.30 versus 0.76 +/- 0.30 circ/sec; p < 
.01), decreased the basal time constant of isovolumic relaxation (24.2 +/- 1.6 
versus 29.9 +/- 2.5 msec; p < .05), and increased the HRcrit (203 +/- 19 versus 
168 +/- 20 bpm; p < .05), without effecting significant changes in either basal 
heart rate (119 +/- 14 versus 111 +/- 17 bpm) or systolic blood pressure (137 
+/- 14 versus 126 +/- 8 mm Hg). Quantitative immunoblotting revealed significant 
decreases in both phospholamban and the ratio of phospholamban to SR Ca2+ 
adenosine triphosphatase in DITPA-treated animals when compared to four 
untreated controls. By contrast, alpha-MHC isoform was undetectable in both 
DITPA treated and control baboons. Thus, DITPA favorably alters the 
stoichiometry between the SR calcium pump and its inhibitor, phospholamban, and 
has positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the normal primate left 
ventricle, which may be useful in the treatment of heart failure. Unlike thyroid 
hormone, these changes occur in the absence of detectable alpha-MHC isoform 
protein expression and without an increase in heart rate."
9070918,"Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and 
congenital deafness. The primary defect is not yet known, although the gene 
causing Pendred syndrome has been localized very recently on chromosome 7q, a 
region that also contains a gene responsible for nonsyndromal hearing loss 
(DFNB4). We confirmed linkage to this chromosome 7 region in five Pendred 
families originating from different ethnic groups, with a highest cumulative lod 
score of 8.26 for marker D7S501. In combination with previous reports, our 
results define a candidate region for the Pendred gene of 1.7 cM flanked by 
markers D7S501 and D7S692."
9070932,"During the recent cloning of the mouse Lyst gene we developed both a 
high-resolution genetic map and a complete YAC and BAC contig of the Lyst 
critical region on mouse Chromosome 13. We also report the mapping of the human 
homologue of the mouse Lyst gene (LYST) to 1q43. These data are consistent with 
LYST being the gene for the human Chediak-Higashi Syndrome and strengthen the 
synteny relationship between MMU13 and human 1q43."
9071267,"311C90 (Zomig; zolmitriptan) is a novel, selective serotonin (5HT)1B/1D receptor 
agonist with both central and peripheral activity, now in late-stage clinical 
development for acute oral treatment of migraine. Several studies have 
demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of 311C90 in the treatment of a 
single migraine headache. The objectives of this open-label study were to assess 
the tolerability and efficacy of repeated doses of 5 mg of 311C90 for acute 
treatment of multiple attacks for up to 1 year. Patients were allowed to treat 
as many migraine headaches (mild, moderate, or severe) as desired with an 
initial dose. A second 5-mg dose could be used to treat recurrence should it 
develop. Safety assessments included ECG, the frequency, intensity, and duration 
of adverse experiences, and routine hematology, urinalysis, and clinical 
chemistry parameters. Efficacy assessments included headache severity at 2 hours 
(i.e., severe, moderate, mild, or none), the proportion of patients pain-free at 
2 hours, the use of a second tablet to treat headache recurrence if it 
developed, and the consistency of these findings over time. The efficacy profile 
and the nature/incidence of adverse events reported appear to be consistent with 
previous 311C90 studies. The dosing regimen was well tolerated during multiple 
exposures. Notably, headache response rates were consistently good after both 
initial and repeated exposure (> 80% across 1 to 30 attacks). For 67% of 
patients who treated at least five attacks, 311C90 was effective 80 to 100% of 
the time."
9073025,"Tay-Sachs disease is a genetically determined neurodegenerative disorder, 
resulting from mutations of the hexosaminidase (Hex) A gene coding for the 
alpha-subunit of beta-D-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase. Clinically, there is severe 
encephalomyelopathy leading to death within the first few years of life. Hex A 
activity is usually absent in tissue and body fluids of these patients. Juvenile 
and adult Hex A deficiencies are less severe but rare variants with some 
residual Hex A activity. All these variants are most prevalent among Ashkenazi 
Jews. We describe a non-Jewish family in which four adult brothers and sisters 
had markedly reduced Hex A activities and onset of symptoms in the second decade 
of life. The phenotypical expression was remarkably homogeneous, consisting in a 
combination of slowly progressive motor neuron disease, ataxia and ocular motor 
disturbances. None of the patients were demented at this stage of their illness. 
Magnetic resonance studies showed severe cerebellar atrophy, but were otherwise 
normal. Hex A deficiency was established by biochemical measurements in the 
serum and skin fibroblasts using the fluorogenic substrates 4-MUG and 4-MUGS as 
well as by gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic studies revealed that the 
patients are compound heterozygotes for the 'adult' mutation Gly269 --> Ser and 
the 'infantile' 4-base insertion in exon 11 of the Hex A gene."
9073029,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is found in a familial form in around 5-10% 
of cases. Of these familial cases around 20% are associated with mutations of 
SOD-1. The genetic basis of the disease in the remaining familial cases, and 
genetic risk factors in sporadic cases, are unknown. Recently, the common forms 
of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have been associated with mutations of the SMN 
and NAIP genes on chromosome 5, in the region q11.2-13.3. Some patients with 
both familial and sporadic motor neuron disease show only lower motor neuron 
signs, in common with SMA patients, and families containing individuals with 
phenotypes of both childhood SMA and adult motor neuron disease have been 
reported. We therefore examined the SMA locus as a candidate for ALS, in 54 
patients with sporadic motor neuron disease, and 10 single-generation familial 
patients (with no evidence of SOD-1 mutations), and in a single patient with 
Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. No mutations of the SMN or NAIP genes were 
detected. The difficulties of classification of lower motor neuron presentations 
of motor neuron diseases are discussed. The demonstration that mutations 
diagnostic of SMA are not found in ALS patients helps distinguish these 
conditions."
9074937,"In the mouse, the activity of Sry (sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome) 
initiates the transformation of the indifferent gonad into a testis. In humans, 
a partial Xp21 duplication leads to the development of ovaries instead of testes 
in XY individuals. This observation indicates that sex determination might also 
be influenced by a gene-dosage compensation mechanism, in addition to a dominant 
action of the Sry gene. In female mammals, the regulation of X-linked gene 
dosage at early embryogenesis is achieved through the inactivation of one of the 
two X chromosomes. Here we have investigated the possibility that inactivation 
of the X chromosome may play a role in male sex determination. We have shown, 
using an X-linked lacZ transgenic mouse line, that loss of beta-galactosidase 
activity occurs in certain somatic cells of the developing male urogenital 
ridge. When changes associated with apoptosis of mesonephric tubules in the 
developing urogenital ridges are taken into account, expression of the Xist (X 
inactive specific transcript) gene correlates with X inactivation revealed by 
loss of beta-galactosidase activity in very early mesonephric tubule epithelial 
cells, gonadal interstitial mesenchymal cells and coelomic epithelial cells."
9078538,"Thyroid hormone status was assessed in 132 children with congenital heart 
defects undergoing cardiac surgery (median age 3.1 y; range 2 d to 16.2 y). 
Plasma TSH, thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse 
triiodothyronine (rT3), thyroglobulin (Tg), and urinary iodine excretion were 
measured before and every other day after cardiac surgery (d 1-21). After 
surgery we observed strikingly low plasma concentrations of TSH (0.4 mU/L; 
0.2-1.3), T3 (0.6 nmol/L; 0.3-1.2), T4 (48.9 nmol/L; 12.9-82.4), IT4 (12.9 
pmol/L; 5.1-19.3), and Tg (9.4 micrograms/L; 1.5-20.6), whereas rT3 plasma 
concentrations increased (0.13 pmol/L; 0.05-0.3; n = 40). The maximal 
post-operative changes of TSH and rT3 preceded changes of T3, T4, fT4, and Tg. 
Postoperative urinary iodine excretion increased significantly (n = 109). 
Thyroid hormone plasma concentrations were lowest after cardiopulmonary bypass 
operations and in patients treated with dopamine. In patients with postoperative 
T3 plasma concentrations less than 0.6 nmol/L (n =52) the period of mechanical 
ventilation and intensive care treatment was significantly prolonged. 
Furthermore, the cumulative doses of inotropic and vasoactive catecholamines and 
furosemide were significantly higher in this patient group. Our results 
demonstrate transient secondary hypothyroidism in children after cardiac surgery 
that may contribute to postoperative cardiac and respiratory dysfunction and may 
delay recovery. Possible benefits of thyroid hormone replacement therapy need to 
be thoroughly examined."
9079656,"O6-Methylguanine is removed from DNA via the transfer of the methyl group to a 
cysteine acceptor site present in the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA 
alkyltransferase. The human alkyltransferase is inactivated by the free base 
O6-benzylguanine, raising the possibility that substantially larger alkyl groups 
could also be accepted as substrates. However, the Escherichia coli 
alkyltransferase, Ada-C, is not inactivated by O6-benzylguanine. The Ada-C 
protein was rendered capable of reaction by the incorporation of two 
site-directed mutations converting Ala316 to a proline (A316P) and Trp336 to 
alanine (W336A) or glycine (W336G). These changes increase the space at the 
active site of the protein where Cys321 is buried and thus permit access of the 
O6-benzylguanine inhibitor. Reaction of the mutant A316P/W336A-Ada-C with 
O6-benzylguanine was greatly stimulated by the presence of DNA, providing strong 
support for the concept that binding of DNA to the Ada-C protein activates the 
protein. The Ada-C protein was able to repair O6-benzylguanine in a 16-mer 
oligodeoxyribonucleotide. However, the rate of repair was very slow, whereas the 
E. coli Ogt, the human alkyltransferase, and the mutant A316P/W336A-Ada-C 
alkyltransferases reacted very rapidly with this 16-mer substrate and 
preferentially repaired it when incubated with a mixture of the methylated and 
benzylated 16-mers. These results show that benzyl groups are better substrates 
than methyl groups for alkyltransferases provided that steric factors do not 
prevent binding of the substrate in the correct orientation for alkyl group 
transfer."
9080592,"This study investigated the mode of action of conantokin-T, a 21 amino acid 
peptide toxin isolated from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail Conus 
tulipa, on excitatory synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices using 
intracellular recording techniques. Superfusion of conantokin-T (1-500 nM) 
specifically and irreversibly decreased the pharmacologically isolated 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential 
(EPSPNMDA) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on normal 
excitatory synaptic transmission (EPSP). The sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons 
to NMDA but not to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid was 
also antagonized by conantokin-T pretreatment. In addition, the 
conantokin-T-induced depression of EPSPNMDA could be antagonized by prior 
treatment of hippocampal slices with either DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleate (10 
microM) or ifenprodil (20 microM). However, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (1 microM) 
had no effect on the action of conantokin-T. These findings indicated that 
conantokin-T modulates the NMDA receptor by an interaction with its glutamate 
binding site and polyamine recognition site."
9082794,"The vocal tract from the glottis to the lips is considered to he a resonator and 
the voice is changeable depending upon the shape of the vocal tract. In this 
report, we examined the change in pharyngeal size and acoustic feature of voice 
after tonsillectomy.
METHODS: Subjects were 20 patients. The distance between both anterior pillars 
(glossopalatine arches), and between both posterior pillars (pharyngopalatine 
arches) was measured weekly. For acoustic measurements, the five Japanese vowels 
and Japanese conversational sentences were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: The distance between both anterior pillars became wider 2 weeks 
postoperatively, and tended to become narrower thereafter. The distance between 
both posterior pillars became wider even after 4 weeks postoperatively. No 
consistent changes in F0, F1 and F2 were found after surgery. Although there was 
a tendency for a decrease in F3, tonsillectomy did not appear to change the 
acoustical features of the Japanese vowels remarkably. It was assumed that the 
subject may adjust the shape of the vocal tract to produce consistent speech 
sounds after the surgery using auditory feedback."
9084440,"Hyperphosphorylated tau, the major component of the paired helical filaments of 
Alzheimer's disease, was found to accumulate in the brains of mice in which the 
calcineurin A alpha gene was disrupted [calcineurin A alpha knockout (CNA alpha 
-/-)]. The hyperphosphorylation involved several sites on tau, especially the 
Ser396 and/or Ser404 recognized by the PHF-1 monoclonal antibody. The increase 
in phosphorylated tau content occurred primarily in the mossy fibers of the CNA 
alpha -/- hippocampus, which contained the highest level of calcineurin in 
brains of wild-type mice. The CNA alpha -/- mossy fibers also contained less 
neurofilament protein than normal, although the overall level of neurofilament 
phosphorylation was unchanged. In the electron microscope, the mossy fibers of 
CNA alpha -/- mice exhibited abnormalities in their cytoskeleton and a lower 
neurofilament/microtubule ratio than those of wild-type animals. These findings 
indicate that hyperphosphorylated tau can accumulate in vivo as a result of 
reduced calcineurin activity and is accompanied by cytoskeletal changes that are 
likely to have functional consequences on the affected neurons. The CNA alpha 
-/- mice were found in a separate study to have deficits in learning and memory 
that may result in part from the cytoskeletal changes in the hippocampus."
9088928,"The effects of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on the contractility of 
electrically stimulated and perfused isolated rat hearts were investigated. TRH 
in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on 
cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher 
concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly 
enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7 
and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak 
contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH 
(i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l, 
which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of 
contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1 
+/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, 
in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac 
contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner, 
which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling 
pathway."
9088998,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antipyretic action of tolfenamic 
acid, as well as its possible adverse reactions, especially in children with 
severe or partial form of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. 
In the study 55 febrile children were included, whose mean age was +/- SD 3.5 
+/- 3.3 years, range 0.5-15. Ten of them had severe or partial form of G6PD 
deficiency. Fifty-three of the patients responded with a decrease of temperature 
which lasted at least 6 hours, though in 2 of them the temperature decrease 
lasted less than 6 hours. The tolerance of the drug was good and no side-effects 
were noted. None of the patients with or without G6PD deficiency showed 
symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings indicating hemolysis before 
administration of the drug and 4 days thereafter. In conclusion, tolfenamic acid 
is a strong antipyretic agent with excellent tolerance and high safety in 
children."
9090878,"We show that among ecotypes of Arabidopsis, there is considerable variation in 
their susceptibility to crown gall disease. Differences in susceptibility are 
heritable and, in one ecotype, segregate as a single major contributing locus. 
In several ecotypes, recalcitrance to tumorigenesis results from decreased 
binding of Agrobacterium to inoculated root explants. The recalcitrance of 
another ecotype occurs at a late step in T-DNA transfer. Transient expression of 
a T-DNA-encoded beta-glucuronidase gusA gene is efficient, but the ecotype is 
deficient in crown gall tumorigenesis, transformation to kanamycin resistance, 
and stable GUS expression. This ecotype is also more sensitive to gamma 
radiation than is a susceptible ecotype. DNA gel blot analysis showed that after 
infection by Agrobacterium, less T-DNA was integrated into the genome of the 
recalcitrant ecotype than was integrated into the genome of a highly susceptible 
ecotype."
9091512,"BACKGROUND: Although topically applied all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) 
undergoes minimal absorption and adds negligibly to normal endogenous levels, 
its safety in humans is occasionally questioned because oral ingestion of 
retinoids at therapeutic levels is known to entail teratogenic risks.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the actual potential for developmental toxicity from 
treatment with topical tretinoin.
METHODS: Risk assessments were conducted on four known human developmental 
toxicants (valproic acid, methotrexate, thalidomide, and isotretinoin) and a 
potential developmental toxicant (acetylsalicylic acid). The margin of safety 
for each chemical was calculated from the ratio of animal no-observed adverse 
effect levels to human lowest-observed adverse effect levels or estimated 
exposure doses.
RESULTS: The derived safety margin of more than 100 for topical tretinoin (with 
2% absorption) contrasted sharply with the near unity values for valproic acid, 
methotrexate, thalidomide, and isotretinoin and was larger than that for 
acetylsalicylic acid.
CONCLUSION: These data support other epidemiologic and animal data that topical 
tretinoin is not a potential human developmental toxicant."
9091577,"Cytokine and growth factor receptor engagement leads to the rapid 
phosphorylation and activation of latent, cytosolic signal transducers and 
activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, which then translocate to the 
nucleus where they regulate transcriptional events from specific promoter 
sequences. STAT3 expression in particular has been associated with Abl, Src, and 
HTLV-1 transformation of normal cells. B-1 lymphocytes are self-renewing, CD5+ B 
cells that display a propensity for malignant transformation and are the normal 
counterpart to human chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Further, B-1 cells are 
characterized by aberrant intracellular signaling, including hyperresponsiveness 
to phorbol ester PKC agonists. Here we demonstrate that B-1 lymphocytes 
constitutively express nuclear activated STAT3, which is not expressed by 
unmanipulated conventional (B-2) lymphocytes. In contrast, STAT3 activation is 
induced in B-2 cells after antigen receptor engagement in a delayed fashion 
(after 3 h). Induction of STAT3 is inhibited by both the serine/threonine 
protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and 
requires de novo protein synthesis, demonstrating novel coupling between sIg and 
STAT proteins that differs from the classical paradigm for STAT induction by 
cytokine receptors. The inability of prolonged stimulation of conventional B-2 
cells with anti-Ig, a treatment sufficient to induce CD5 expression, to result 
in sustained STAT3 activation suggests that STAT3 is a specific nuclear marker 
for B-1 cells. Thus, STAT3 may play a role in B cell antigen-specific signaling 
responses, and its constitutive activation is associated with a normal cell 
population exhibiting intrinsic proliferative behavior."
9092799,"Nuclear hormone receptors are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play 
critical roles in chordate development and homeostasis. Aberrant nuclear hormone 
receptors have been implicated as causal agents in a number of endocrine and 
neoplastic diseases. The syndrome of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a 
human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to 
thyroid hormone. RTH is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone 
receptor beta-gene. The resulting mutant receptors function as dominant 
negatives, interfering with the actions of normal thyroid hormone receptors 
coexpressed in the same cells. We report here that RTH receptors interact 
aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors 
variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), retinoid X receptor 
interacting protein-13 (RIP-13), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid 
hormone receptors (SMRT), and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor 
(TRAC). All RTH receptors tested exhibit an impaired ability to dissociate from 
corepressors in the presence of thyroid hormone. Two of the RTH mutations 
uncouple corepressor dissociation from hormone binding; two additional RTH 
mutants exhibit an unusually strong interaction with corepressor under all 
hormone conditions tested. Finally, artificial mutants that abolish corepressor 
binding abrogate the dominant negative activity of RTH mutants. We suggest that 
an altered corepressor interaction is likely to play a critical role in the 
dominant negative potency of RTH mutants and may contribute to the variable 
phenotype in this disorder."
9094028,"To date, three genes have been identified as susceptibility genes for 
Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin-B receptor 
gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3). However, the question of whether 
these genes play a role in sporadically occurring HSCR has not been fully 
clarified. In this study, the authors performed mutation analysis of these three 
genes in 41 sporadic HSCR patients without any family history by using 
single-strand conformational polymorphism or denaturing gradient gel 
electrophoresis methods. Exon 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, and 17 of the RET gene, 7 
exons of the EDNRB gene, and the region of the EDN3 gene including sequences 
corresponding to proteolytic cleavage sites and mature endothelin-3 were 
analysed. By direct sequencing, three causative RET mutations were confirmed; a 
Phe to Ser substitution at codon 174, a Cys to Tyr substitution at codon 197, 
and a point mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 12, in patients with 
aganglionosis confined to the rectosigmoid colon, the transverse colon, and the 
total colon, respectively. In the EDNRB locus, two mutations were observed; a 
nonsense mutation of Trp to stop at codon 275, and a T insertion at nucleotide 
878, in patients with aganglionosis confined to the rectosigmoid colon, and the 
descending colon, respectively. No mutation was detected in the EDN3 gene. 
Mutation rates were 7.3% in the RET and 5% in the EDNRB gene. Our data indicate 
that RET and EDNRB mutations have a role in the aetiology of some sporadically 
occurring HSCR. However, the low mutation rate of susceptibility genes in 
sporadically occurring HSCR suggests that other genes or environmental factors 
are involved in the development of the disease."
9094058,"The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease in which

125I-omega-conotoxin GVIA (125I-omega-CgTx), respectively. We then tested sera 
from 72 LEMS patients' 25 with proven small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 66 
healthy or other neurological, SCLC or autoimmune disease controls in an 
immunoprecipitation assay using 125I-omega-CmTx-labelled (P/Q-type) VGCCs in 
human cerebellar extract. Sixty-six of 72 LEMS serum samples (91.7%) were 
positive for the presence of VGCC antibodies, as defined as a titre greater than 
3 standard deviations above the mean for the healthy controls (n = 22). Rabbit 
cerebellar extract as antigen gave similar results (r = 0.94, P < 0.001, n = 
30). By contrast, only 24/72 (33%) LEMS sera were positive in the assay for 
anti-N-type VGCC antibodies using 125I-omega-CgTx. All these 24 were also 
positive in the 125I-omega-CmTx assay. All healthy and disease control sera were 
negative in both assays. The anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody titres did not 
correlate with an electrophysiological index of disease severity across 
individuals; however, longitudinal studies in a LEMS patient with SCLC receiving 
chemotherapy, and in a non-SCLC LEMS patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy 
showed an inverse relation between antibody titre and disease severity. These 
results support the view that anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies are implicated in 
the motor disorder in LEMS, and show that the omega-CmTx radioimmunoassay is a 
highly specific and sensitive means of detecting them."
9094221,"Gas vesicles are intracellular, microbial flotation devices that consist of 
mainly one protein, GvpA. The formation of halobacterial gas vesicles occurs 
along a complex pathway involving 14 different gvp genes that are clustered in a 
genomic region termed the ""vac region"". Various vac regions found in 
Halobacterium salinarum (p-vac and c-vac), Haloferax mediterranei (mc-vac), and 
Natronobacterium vacuolatum (nv-vac) have been investigated. Except for the 
latter vac region, the arrangement of the gvp genes is identical. Single gvp 
genes have been mutated to study the effect on gas vesicle synthesis in 
transformants and to determine their possible function. Each vac region exhibits 
a characteristic transcription pattern, and regulatory steps have been observed 
at the DNA, RNA, and protein level, indicating a complex regulatory network 
acting during gas vesicle gene expression."
9096828,"BACKGROUND: Numerous questions have been raised about the health consequences to 
veterans of the Gulf War but most particularly to issues concerning women, who 
were deployed in unprecedented numbers. Little is known about the health 
consequences to women of wartime stressors, in general, or the environmental and 
job-related exposures specific to the theater of the Gulf War.
METHODS: A stratified sample of 525 women participated in the study following 
the war and again in a follow-up study 2 yr later. The sampling frame was 
stratified on component of the U.S. Air Force (active, guard or reserve), 
deployment (in the theater or elsewhere), and parental status (parent or 
nonparent). Measures included items concerning general physical health, 
gender-specific health, the ""Gulf War Syndrome,"" and the emotional responses to 
war, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
RESULTS: Multiple statistical analyses were used to describe women's physical 
and emotional health at two time points following the war. Women deployed to the 
theater reported significantly more general as well as gender-specific health 
problems than did women deployed elsewhere. A cluster of common health problems 
included: skin rash, cough, depression, unintentional weight loss, insomnia, and 
memory problems. Women serving in the theater also reported a significant 
increase in several gender-specific problems compared to women deployed 
elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the need for follow-up of a cluster of specific 
health effects, including those concerning gynecologic and reproductive health."
9097825,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with sulphasalazine of patients with mild and moderate 
forms of Crohn's disease may result in side effects in some of them.
CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old girl with Crohn's disease was given 40 mg/kd/day of 
sulphasalazine after achieving remission with prednisone. She developed 
urticaria and eosionophilia 8 days later, then extended skin edema during a 
second course of sulphasalazine requiring methyl prednisolone therapy. 
Mesalazine administration (25 mg/kg/day), one month later, resulted to watery 
stools, vomiting, and fever, a side effect observed again after two further 
mesalazine challenges of one-month interval. Eosionophilia was present and the 
lymphocyte stimulation test with mesalazine was positive. Successful 
desensitization to sulphasalazine could be obtained 9 months later permitting 
further safe administration of this drug up to 18 months.
CONCLUSION: Hypersensitivity to sulphasalazine may be successfully overcame by 
oral desensitization, especially in those patients with low-grade activity of 
Crohn's disease."
9098920,"Thalidomide, mainly used for the treatment of leprosy, is a current teratogen in 
South America, and it is reasonable to assume that at present this situation is 
affecting many births in underdeveloped countries. Moreover, the potential 
re-marketing of thalidomide for the treatment of a large variety of diseases may 
extend the problem to the developed world. When the drug is available, the 
control of its intake during early pregnancy is very difficult since most 
pregnancies are unintended. The ongoing occurrence of thalidomide embryopathy 
cases went undetected by the ECLAMC, due to several factors: (1) low 
populational coverage through this monitoring system; (2) pre-existence of the 
teratogen with its effects present in both baseline (expected) and monitored 
(observed) materials; and (3) lack of a defined phenotype to be monitored. Thus, 
if thalidomide re-enters the market throughout the world, due to the wide range 
of new applications, occurrence of phocomelia alone might not be sufficient to 
detect its effects. By a case-reference approach, the ECLAMC registered 34 
thalidomide embryopathy cases born in South America after 1965 whose birthplaces 
correspond to endemic areas for leprosy. Phocomelia was found in five of eleven 
fully described cases. Thus, phocomelia alone is neither specific nor sufficient 
to serve as a suitable phenotype to survey the teratogenic effects of 
thalidomide. Therefore, a thalidomide-like phenotype, defined as any bilateral 
upper and/or lower limb reduction defect of the preaxial and/or phocomelia 
types, should be included in the routine surveillance of birth defects in all 
programmes."
9099346,"The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, 
and dosage and administration of amifostine are reviewed. Amifostine is a 
prodrug converted by alkaline phosphatase to the active sulfhydryl compound 
WR-1065. WR-1065 protects normal cells by scavenging free radicals, donating 
hydrogen ions to free radicals, depleting oxygen, and binding to active 
derivatives of antineoplastic agents. The immediate conversion of amifostine to 
WR-1065, its small volume of distribution, and the limited amount of drug and 
metabolite recovered in the urine suggest that amifostine is rapidly 
dephosphorylated and enters cells as its active metabolite. The selectivity of 
amifostine for normal tissue is hypothesized to be a results of the decreased 
vascularity of tumors, decreased activity of alkaline phosphatase in tumor 
cells, and pH dependence of WR-1065 uptake. In clinical studies, amifostine 
decreased the frequency of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, 
neurotoxicity, and myelosuppression. Amifostine has demonstrated an ability to 
decrease the hematologic toxicity of cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, mitomycin, 
and antineoplastic drug combinations. Amifostine has FDA-approved labeling for 
use in reducing cumulative renal toxicity in patients receiving repeat doses of 
cisplatin for advanced ovarian cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. The 
recommended dose in adults is 910 mg/m2 administered as a 15-minute infusion 30 
minutes before the start of chemotherapy. The major adverse effects of 
amifostine include hypotension and emesis. The benefits of amifostine must be 
weighted against its potential adverse effects, and the drug's impact on the 
efficacy of antineoplastics should be further investigated. Amifostine has shown 
promise in protecting non-malignant cells from the toxic effects of 
antineoplastics, apparently without compromising toxicity against cancer cells."
9099757,"The Xist (X inactive specific transcript) gene plays an essential role in X 
chromosome inactivation. To elucidate the mechanisms controlling Xist expression 
and X inactivation, we examined in vivo DNA-protein interactions in the Xist 
promoter region in a female mouse cell line (BMSL2), which has distinguishable 
Xist alleles. In vivo footprinting was accomplished by treatment of cells with 
dimethyl sulfate or ultraviolet light, followed by ligation-mediated polymerase 
chain reaction of purified DNA. The expressed allele on the inactive X 
chromosome and the silent allele on the active X chromosome were separated by 
the use of a restriction fragment length polymorphism prior to ligation-mediated 
polymerase chain reaction. The chromatin structure of the Xist promoter was 
found to be consistent with the activity state of the Xist gene. The silent 
allele (on the active X chromosome) showed no footprints, while the expressed 
allele (on the inactive X chromosome) showed footprints at a consensus sequence 
for a CCAAT box, two weak Sp1 sites, and a weak TATA box."
9099905,"Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a frequent complication of squamous cell 
carcinomas of the lung, is mediated by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide 
(PTHrP). This study was undertaken to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and two nonhypercalcemic analogues. EB1089 and 
22-oxa-1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (OCT), suppress PTHrP gene expression in a human lung 
squamous cancer cell line, NCI H520. All three compounds (1) decreased 
steady-state PTHrP mRNA and secreted peptide levels via a transcriptional 
mechanism; (2) modulated promoter activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive DNA 
sequences; and (3) activated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) both in vitro and in 
vivo. Thus, EB1089 and OCT inhibit PTHrP gene expression in NCI H520 cells and 
modulate gene expression through the same mechanism as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), namely, 
activation of the VDR. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is hypercalcemic in vivo. However, the 
noncalcemic analogues EB1089 and OCT have a therapeutic potential through 
suppression of PTHrP gene transcription."
9106214,"The two major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis are the tripartite toxin 
and the polyglutamate capsule, which are encoded by genes on the large plasmids, 
pXO1 and pXO2, respectively. The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located 
on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in 
bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively. A 
derivative strain cured of pXO1 produced less capsular substance than the parent 
strain harbouring both pXO1 and pXO2, and electroporation of the strain cured of 
pXO1 with a plasmid containing the cloned atxA gene resulted in an increased 
level of capsule production. An acpA-null mutant was complemented by not only 
acpA but also the atxA gene. The cap region, which is essential for 
encapsulation, contains three genes capB, capC, and capA, arranged in that 
order. The atxA gene stimulated capsule synthesis from the cloned cap region. 
Transcriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization and 
primer-extension analysis revealed that atxA activated expression of cap in 
trans at the transcriptional level. These results indicate that cross-talk 
occurs, in which the pXO1-located gene, atxA, activates transcription of the cap 
region genes located on pXO2. We identified two major apparent transcriptional 
start sites, designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, 
respectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. 
Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and 
activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. Deletion analysis of the 
upstream region of the cap promoter revealed that activation by both atxA and 
acpA required a DNA segment of 70 bp extending upstream of the P1 site. These 
results suggest that cross-talk by atxA to the genes encoding capsule synthesis 
is caused by the interaction of the atxA gene product with a regulatory sequence 
upstream of cap."
9108791,"Gene polymorphisms associated with the plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, 
and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)-hemostasis proteins that help to 
predict the risk of atherothrombotic disease-were compared in 124 healthy 
individuals > or = 100 years old and 130 young, healthy individuals to identify 
genetic influences on extreme longevity. We investigated the restriction 
fragment length polymorphism G/A-455 located in the promoter of the 
beta-fibrinogen gene, the guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism 4G/5G in the 
promoter of the PAI-1 gene, and the R353Q substitution polymorphism in exon 8 of 
the factor VII gene. Alleles and genotypes associated with elevated plasma 
levels of fibrinogen and factor VII were found with similar frequencies in 
centenarians and in the comparison group. However, in centenarians there was a 
significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G 
genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a 
predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that 
the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have 
escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme 
limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association 
with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging."

9111096,"We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with a significant history of drug and 
alcohol abuse, which included smoking marijuana mixed with brodifacoum. As a 
consequence, the patient developed a prolonged coagulopathy that persisted for 
more than 1 year. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the 
literature in which super-warfarin intoxication has been associated with 
marijuana smoking. This report should increase the awareness of pathologists and 
clinicians when examining a patient with a history of drug abuse who exhibits 
persistent vitamin K1-dependent coagulopathy."
9111196,"In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six 
keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair 
three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA 
double strand breaks (DSB). The model comprised the spontaneously immortalized, 
non-tumorigenic human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, four different c-Ha-ras 
transfectants of HaCaT (non-, benign- and two malignant-tumorigenic) and a 
SCC-derived cell line. Host cell reactivation assays with UVB-treated plasmid 
vectors pRSVcat showed no significantly altered repair of UVB-induced pyrimidine 
dimers in the tumorigenic cell lines, compared with the non-tumorigenic lines. 
Using the singlet oxygen-treated plasmids pRSVcat the Ha-ras-HaCaT-clones and 
the SCC-cells, exerted a DNA repair efficiency that was not significantly 
different from HaCaT cells. In order to assess the ability of the cells to 
ligate free DNA ends (repair of DSB), we used a plasmid shuttle vector assay 
with linearized plasmid pZ189. We found a significant increase of DNA end 
joining ability in the non-tumorigenic, the benign and in one of the malignant 
HaCaT-clones II-4. The malignant HaCaT-clone II-3, however, exerted a 
significantly lower rate of rejoining the linearized plasmid. This cell line 
also showed a highly and significantly elevated rate of micronuclei, which 
reflects a pronounced chromosomal instability. The SCC-cells exhibited a more 
efficient repair of DNA DSB than the HaCaT cells. We conclude that in the 
examined model, progression of human keratinocytes from the non-tumorigenic to 
the highly tumorigenic phenotype, is not accompanied by a decrease in the cell's 
capacity to repair UVB- and singlet oxygen-induced DNA lesions. However, an 
acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism 
promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal 
stability."
9112448,"PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the 
site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related, 
and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on 
radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of 
medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991. 
Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation 
and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were 
retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to 
the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully 
assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 
children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder 
with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa 
fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits 
were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival.
RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior 
portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the 
supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 
children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On 
multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly 
correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the 
total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon 
beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free 
survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, 
or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the 
radiotherapy-related technical factors.
CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial 
failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered 
that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of 
relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach 
this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A 
significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was 
not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of 
small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior 
fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach."
9114030,"The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) consists of four 
erythroid-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) at the 5' end of the 
beta-globin cluster. The LCR functions over a long distance on chromosome 11 to 
regulate transcription and replication of the beta-globin genes. To determine 
whether the HSs function independently or as an integrated unit, we analyzed the 
requirements for long-range transcriptional activation. If the HSs function 
independently, individual HSs would be expected to have long-range activity. In 
contrast, if long-range activity requires multiple HSs, individual HSs would 
have a limited functional distance. HS2, HS3, and a miniLCR containing multiple 
HSs, were separated from a gamma-globin promoter by fragments of phage lambda 
DNA. After stable transfection into K562 cells, HS2 had strong enhancer 
activity, but only when positioned close to the promoter. HS3 also had strong 
enhancer activity, although it was weaker than HS2 and more sensitive to the 
spacer DNA. The miniLCR had the strongest enhancer activity and functioned even 
at a distance of 7.3 kb. A model is proposed in which synergistic interactions 
between HSs confer long-range activation by creating a stable LCR nucleoprotein 
structure, which is competent for recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. These 
enzymes would mediate the well-characterized activity of the LCR to modulate 
chromatin structure."
9115173,"The actin-cross-linking protein spectrin is a prominent component of the 
membrane cytoskeleton. Spectrin is a tetramer of two antiparallel 
alphabeta-dimers which share a unique and ancient gene structure. The 
alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin genes are composed primarily of tandemly 
repeated 106-amino-acid segments, each of which forms a triple alpha-helical 
coiled coil. Both the genes and the repeats themselves are homologous. The two 
genes are thought to be the result of a gene duplication event, and each gene is 
the product of duplications of the 106-amino-acid repeats. In this work we 
compare the process of molecular evolution across the repeated segments of the 
alpha- and beta-spectrin genes. We find that the alpha-spectrin segments have, 
for the most part, evolved in a homogeneous fashion, while considerable 
heterogeneity is found among beta-spectrin segments. Several segments with 
unique known functions are found to have evolved differently than the others. On 
the basis of heterogeneity of the evolutionary process, we suggest that at least 
one repeat has a unique function that has yet to be documented. We also present 
new statistical methods for comparing the evolutionary process between different 
regions of DNA sequences."
9115628,"Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of short-limb dwarfism. Recently, 
the gene mutation responsible for ACH has been identified in the transmembrane 
domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The cause of ACH is a 
point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA, resulting in the substitution of 
an arginine residue for a glycine. For the purpose of prenatal diagnosis of ACH, 
we have used the nested polymerase chain reaction to ensure the gene 
amplification. Although the normal allele has no restriction site around the 
causative sequence, we have devised an unique method to incorporate a 
restriction site of SplI into the normal allele only using modified primer sets. 
We report here the use of this polymerase chain reaction methodology which can 
ensure the gene amplification and omit the complicated steps of sequencing for 
prenatal diagnosis."
9117915,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of adequacy of thyroid hormone replacement 
therapy on coronary atherosclerosis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of elderly hypothyroid patients with 
coexisting coronary artery disease. The association between the adequacy of 
thyroid replacement and the progression of angiographic coronary artery disease 
was investigated. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis.
SETTING: Coronary angiographies were performed at the Cardiac Catheterization 
Laboratory of the Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia, the only 
tertiary referral centre for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Information 
about the past and current thyroid status of the subjects was collected from 
their family physicians.
PATIENTS: Of 4103 patients admitted for coronary angiography during 1992 and 
1993, 25 were on thyroid replacement therapy to treat hypothyroidism. Ten 
patients who underwent more than one coronary arteriography were selected (seven 
females and three males, mean age 65 +/- 10 years).
RESULTS: Of five patients inadequately treated for hypothyroidism, all 
demonstrated angiographic evidence of coronary atherosclerosis progression. 
However, five of seven who were treated adequately did not show atherosclerosis 
progression (P = 0.02, OR = 0.72, 95% CI 1.36 to infinity). Decreasing or 
maintaining the dose of L-thyroxine at 100 micrograms or less resulted in 
coronary atherosclerosis progression in six of six patients, whereas five of six 
patients taking fixed or increasing doses of L-thyroxine 150 micrograms or 
higher were spared from disease progression (P = 0.015, OR = 0.41, 95% CI 2.4 to 
infinity).
CONCLUSIONS: Angiographic coronary artery disease progression may be prevented 
by adequate thyroid replacement in hypothyroidism. With the help of modern, 
sensitive thyroid stimulating hormone assays higher doses of L-thyroxine may be 
safer and more effective in the atherosclerosis management of this patient 
population. Thyroid hormones can protect against atherosclerosis, presumably due 
to their metabolic affects on plaque progression."
9118249,"The secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells consists of a number of distinct 
membrane-bound compartments interconnected by vesicular traffic. Each 
compartment has a characteristic content of proteins and lipids, which must be 
maintained. This is achieved in most cases by active sorting-proteins may reach 
the wrong compartment but are continually retrieved. A good example is the 
retrieval system for lumenal ER proteins. These proteins carry a specific 
sorting signal, typically the tetrapeptide KDEL, which is bound by a receptor in 
the Golgi apparatus. The receptor-ligand complex, together with escaped ER 
membrane proteins, returns to the ER. Many of the components of vesicle traffic, 
including the coat proteins required for vesicle budding from the ER, those that 
form retrograde vesicles on post-ER compartments, and integral membrane proteins 
that target the vesicles to their correct destination, have been identified. The 
sorting events that occur can largely be understood in terms of specific 
protein-protein interactions involving these components. However, sorting of 
some membrane proteins, including the vesicle targeting molecules, is influenced 
by their transmembrane domains, and it is likely that segregation of these is 
dependent on the composition and biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer, 
which very between compartments. The secretory pathway is thus a dynamic entity, 
split into discrete organelles by the constant segregation and recycling of 
lipids and proteins, processes that are ultimately driven by the mechanics of 
vesicle formation and fusion."
9119194,"Fully virulent Bacillus anthracis bacilli are encapsulated and toxinogenic. 
These bacteria carry two plasmids, pXO1, and pXO2, encoding toxins and capsule 
synthetic-enzymes (capB, C, A, dep), respectively. The PXO1 plasmid strongly 
enhances capsule formation. This influence was studied by analysing the 
expression of a capB-lacZ fusion in various backgrounds. The beta-galactosidase 
activities were similar in a delta atxA strain and a pXO1 cured strain. 
Moreover, the capB-lacZ expression level could be restored, in a pXO1 cured 
strain, by addition of atxA in trans. Thus, we conclude that the pX01 influence 
on capsule synthesis is mediated by AtxA, the pXO1-encoded trans-activator of 
the toxin gene expression."
9119223,"The precursor primer RNA for mammalian mitochondrial DNA leading-strand 
replication remains as a persistent R loop formed during transcription through 
the mitochondrial DNA control region. We have examined model R loops, which 
exist in a novel and physiologically accurate preprimer conformation, as 
potential substrates for mammalian RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP). 
Mouse RNase MRP accurately cleaves an R loop containing the mouse mitochondrial 
DNA origin. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the 
priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of 
generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers."
9120226,"Efficacy and safety of gabapentin monotherapy were evaluated in 33 children with 
newly diagnosed absence epilepsy in two identical, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials in which a 2-week double-blind treatment phase was 
followed by a 6-week open-label phase. Primary efficacy criterion was seizure 
frequency change from baseline to end of double-blind treatment derived from 
quantified electroencephalograms. Primary efficacy analyses compared treatment 
differences in the 2-week double-blind phase. Gabapentin did not significantly 
decrease or increase seizure frequency compared with placebo. Low dosages with 
possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels may have contributed to the lack of 
demonstrable efficacy. Somnolence and dizziness were the only adverse events 
reported by at least two patients during gabapentin treatment. No clinically 
important changes in laboratory assessments or other safety parameters were 
observed. Gabapentin monotherapy at dosages ranging from 9.7 through 19.1 
mg/kg/day is well tolerated in pediatric patients aged 4 through 12 years with 
absence epilepsy."
9120624,"Bow hunter's stroke results from vertebrobasilar insufficiency caused by 
mechanical occlusion or stenosis of the vertebral artery (VA) at the C1-2 level 
on head rotation. Surgical treatment of this condition may be chosen to avoid 
life-threatening accidents or because patients complain that conservative 
treatments such as verbal warnings or use of a neck brace to limit head and neck 
rotation are ineffective and thus restrict their lifestyle. Posterior fusion 
involving C1-2 has long been used to limit atlantoaxial rotational movements. 
However, it has the serious disadvantage that the range of head motion is 
severely reduced. Recently, decompression of the atlantoaxial portions of the 
affected VA has been used because it does not limit physiological neck 
movements. However, no long-term follow-up review of patients who have undergone 
this procedure has been conducted, and it is unclear whether this procedure 
always provides relief of symptoms. To answer this question, the results of C1-2 
posterior fusion were compared with decompression of the VA for the treatment of 
bow hunter's stroke."

9121757,"PURPOSE: The authors describe the clinical feature of ten patients with a new 
syndrome characterized by the presence of retinal vasculitis, multiple 
macroaneurysms, neuro-retinitis, and peripheral capillary nonperfusion.
METHODS: The authors evaluated ten patients identified to have clinical features 
compatible with the syndrome of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms and 
neuroretinits (IRVAN). Clinical examination findings, sequential funds 
photographs (when available), fluorescein angiograms, systemic investigations, 
response to therapy, and visual outcomes were reviewed.
RESULTS: Seven eyes of four patients sustained a marked decrease in visual 
acuity of 20/200 or worse. Visual loss was due to a combination of an exudative 
maculopathy and sequelae of retinal ischemia. Capillary nonperfusion was seen in 
all ten patients and was severe enough to warrant panretinal laser 
photocoagulation in six patients. Systemic investigations were uniformly 
noncontributory. Oral prednisone appears to have little beneficial effects on 
patients with this disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IRVAN have characteristic retinal features that 
readily identify this syndrome. An increased awareness of this rare syndrome may 
help to identify sight-threatening complications at an earlier stage. The 
authors caution against extensive medical investigations."
9122295,"BACKGROUND: In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) there is a need for 
self-rating scales that are sensitive to treatment effects and have been tested 
in a broad range of trauma survivors. Separate measures of frequency and 
severity may also provide an advantage.
METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-three men and women completed the Davidson 
Trauma Scale (DTS), a 17-item scale measuring each DSM-IV symptom of PTSD on 
5-point frequency and severity scales. These subjects comprised war veterans, 
survivors of rape or hurricane and a mixed trauma group participating in a 
clinical trial. Other scales were included as validity checks as follows: Global 
ratings, SCL-90-R, Eysenck Scale, Impact of Event Scale and Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-III-R.
RESULTS: The scale demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r = 0.86), 
internal consistency (r = 0.99). One main factor emerged for severity and a 
smaller one for intrusion. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, and the factor structure 
more closely resembled the traditional grouping of symptoms. Concurrent validity 
was obtained against the SCID, with a diagnostic accuracy of 83% at a DTS score 
of 40. Good convergent and divergent validity was obtained. The DTS showed 
predictive validity against response to treatment, as well as being sensitive to 
treatment effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The DTS showed good reliability and validity, and offers promised 
as a scale which is particularly suited to assessing symptom severity, treatment 
outcome and in screening for the likely diagnosis of PTSD."
9122836,"BACKGROUND: Cocaine use has been temporally associated with neurovascular 
complications, including the rupture of intracerebral aneurysms. The purpose of 
the current study was to determine the type of neurovascular complications 
associated with cocaine use in our patient population, the temporal relationship 
between cocaine use and their onset, and whether cocaine users with subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH) presented with smaller aneurysms at an earlier age than a 
control group of noncocaine users with SAH.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients who presented to the Detroit Medical Center with 
neurovascular sequelae associated with cocaine use were identified. All patients 
were chronic cocaine users who related a history of recent use confirmed by a 
drug screen. Cocaine users with SAH were compared to a control group of 44 
patients with SAH who presented without evidence of cocaine use.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients presented with SAH. Twelve patients subsequently 
underwent four-vessel cerebral arteriogram revealing 14 aneurysms; six patients 
presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and seven patients with evidence 
of ischemic stroke. Eighteen (54.5%) patients noted onset of their symptoms 
while using cocaine, 87.9% noted onset within 6 hours of use. Delayed 
presentation occurred predominantly in patients who suffered ischemic strokes. 
The average age of patients who used cocaine and presented with SAH secondary to 
a ruptured intracerebral aneurysm was 32.8 years with an average aneurysm 
diameter of 4.9 mm versus an average age of 52.2 years with an average aneurysm 
diameter of approximately 11.0 mm in noncocaine users. Population differences 
were statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Mortality was 27.3% for 
patients who presented with neurovascular sequelae of their cocaine use, with 
77.8% of deaths occurring in patients who presented with SAH.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cocaine use appears to predispose patients who harbor 
incidental neurovascular anomalies to present at an earlier point in their 
natural history than similar non-cocaine users."
9126675,"Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) inhibit voltage-dependent L-type calcium 
channels. This leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and negative inotropic 
and chronotropic effects in the heart. The latter are counteracted in vivo by a 
vasodilatation-triggered, baroreceptor-mediated reflex increase in sympathetic 
tone, resulting in indirect cardiostimulation. The mean vascular/cardiac effect 
ratios of the first-generation CCBs-verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem-are 
relatively low and amount to approximately 3, 10, and 3, respectively. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem are similar. 
The drugs are almost completely absorbed after oral administration, but their 
bioavailability is reduced because of first-pass hepatic metabolism. The onset 
of action of verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem, at least in immediate-release 
formulations, is relatively fast (0.5-2 hours), and their elimination half-lives 
range from 2 to 7 hours. The second-generation CCBs (e.g., amlodipine, 
felodipine, and nisoldipine) have a slower onset of action (due to either 
intrinsic properties of the drug or a slow-release formulation), a longer 
duration of action, and greater vascular/cardiac effect ratios. These features 
may provide therapeutic benefits, for example, a less pronounced increase in 
sympathetic tone and reflex tachycardia, and reduced likelihood of negative 
inotropic effects. These agents can therefore probably be used in patients with 
left ventricular dysfunction."
9128751,"Moyamoya disease is a progressive cerebrovascular occlusive disease that occurs 
frequently in children. The etiology is unknown. We examined changes in 
biological characteristics and responsiveness to serum mitogens during the in 
vitro cellular aging of arterial smooth muscle cell strains derived from 
patients with moyamoya disease (HMSMC) and compared them with those of cells 
from age-matched control patients (HCSMC). HMSMC had a normal human diploid 
chromosome constitution. HMSMC and HCSMC had almost the same in vitro life span 
and the age-related patterns of biological parameters were essentially the same. 
However, the doubling time at the early passages was significantly longer in 
moyamoya SMC than control SMC, although there was no significant difference at 
the late passages. Furthermore, the poor responsiveness of moyamoya SMC to 
platelet-derived growth factor was retained throughout the life span in vitro. 
These results support the hypothesis that functional alterations in vascular 
cells are involved in the mechanism of development of intimal thickening in 
moyamoya disease."
9128755,"The large majority of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions analyzed from 
mitochondrial myopathies and aging humans have been found to be flanked by 
direct repeats, a finding which has led to the slip-replication hypothesis of 
deletion formation. In this study, we have characterized 13 mtDNA deletion 
breakpoints from skeletal muscle harvested from 9- to 27-year-old rhesus 
monkeys. Seven of the deletions, five of which were unique to a particular 
animal, did not have direct repeats at the deletion breakpoints. In contrast, 
two of the three deletions common to several animals had direct repeats flanking 
the breakpoints. It appears, therefore, that at least two different mechanisms 
exist by which mtDNA deletions are formed during aging, one requiring and one 
independent of flanking direct repeats. Furthermore, the species in which mtDNA 
deletions are detected may determine which mechanism predominates."
9129142,"Previous studies showed that the binding of p50/NFkappaB1 to particular kappaB 
DNA sites altered its conformation in a way that correlated with transcriptional 
activation. Here, we investigated the effects of protein-protein interactions on 
the transcriptional activity of p50. We show that the association of p50 with a 
mutant Rel-homology domain (RHD) defective for DNA binding led to synergistic 
activation of kappaB site-dependent transcription, whereas neither protein alone 
had any effect. Partial proteolytic analysis showed that the conformation of p50 
in these complexes differed from that in wild-type c-Rel-RHD/p50 complexes, and 
correlated with activated transcription. These results suggest that the 
Rel-homology domain can act as an allosteric effector to promote transcription 
by p50/NFkappaB1 and that the configuration of p50 is important for its 
activity. This also suggests that Rel proteins can promote transcription by 
other Rel-family members without binding to their DNA recognition site. These 
studies emphasize the important role of protein-protein interactions in Rel and 
NFkappaB-mediated transcription."
9129722,"It is now known that possession of one of the three common forms of the 
apolipoprotein E gene (allele epsilon 4) confers an increased risk for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), both familial and sporadic, and that this risk is 
dose-dependent. Other genes that may play a role in AD, either through 
independent association with the disease or through modification of, or 
interaction with, the existing apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk, are now under 
investigation including the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene, the very low 
density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) gene, and the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene. 
Kamboh et al. [1995] reported that a polymorphism in the 
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin gene could modify the risk for AD conferred by the APOE 
locus, specifically by increasing the risk for AD among epsilon 4 homozygotes. 
The ACT gene, which is found on chromosome 14, has previously been proposed as a 
candidate for AD due to the presence of the ACT protein in senile plaques and 
the reported elevation of the protein in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and 
serum of AD cases. We have investigated this reported association within our 
familial and sporadic AD dataset, where we find no independent association 
between ACT and the occurrence of AD. Logistic regression analysis excludes ACT 
or the interaction between ACT and APOE as significant contributors in the 
prediction of disease status. By this analysis, ACT genotyping does not provide 
additional information about an individual's risk of Alzheimer's disease beyond 
the risk information conferred by APOE genotype alone."
9130129,"Annuloaortic ectasia due to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is reported. A 
10-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of chest pain. On 
admission, he was diagnosed as SGS on the basis of his various anomalies. 
Two-dimensional echocardiography showed a bicuspid aortic valve and marked 
annular dilatation, Doppler flow studies revealed severe aortic regurgitation, 
and retrograde aortography showed severe aortic regurgitation with annular 
dilatation. Successful aortic root replacement was performed; subsequent 
histologic examination of the ascending aorta demonstrated cystic medial 
necrosis. In conclusion, SGS is a generalized connective tissue dysplasia, with 
clinical manifestations of cardiovascular lesions similar to those in Marfan 
syndrome. Aortic root replacement was successfully performed; however, 
recurrence of aortic aneurysms outside of the ascending aorta should be 
carefully observed. Surgical treatment for cardiovascular disorders may be 
necessary to save the life of patients with SGS."
9133488,"Anxiety disorders, which include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, 
posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic 
disorders, are the psychiatric disorders most commonly found in the community, 
according to the results of recent epidemiologic studies. However, failure to 
diagnose these disorders occurs in up to 50% of patients with an anxiety 
disorder. This failure to correctly diagnose and appropriately treat anxiety 
disorders can result in overutilization of health care services and increased 
morbidity and mortality rates from either the anxiety disorder or comorbid 
medical conditions. Reliable diagnostic tools to improve the early recognition 
of anxiety disorders can subsequently result in more effective treatment."
9135495,"The t(11.22)(q24.q12) results in expression of a chimeric RNA product, EWS-FLI1. 
This RNA product is expressed in over 85% of tumours belonging to the Ewing's 
family, and is increasingly used as a definitive characteristic of these 
tumours. In this study, we evaluated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
(RT-PCR) for EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts in 18 neurally derived small round cell 
tumours. These included six Ewing's family tumours and 12 neuroblastomas. 
EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified in all six Ewing's tumours, but also 
in two of the 12 neuroblastomas. One neuroblastoma contained the classic type 1 
fusion transcript, and the second a type 1 transcript containing a 66 bp (base 
pair) insert that was not derived from the EWS or FLI1 gene. The presence of 
EWS-FLI1 fusion products in RNA extracted from primary neuroblastoma suggests 
the identification of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts is not pathognomonic for 
tumours of the Ewing's family. The clinical significance of these fusion 
transcripts in neuroblastoma is not known."
9175735,"Gaucher disease is a heterogeneous disease characterized by impaired activity of 
the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This heterogeneity is attributed to a 
large number of mutations in the corresponding gene. In order to test the 
biochemical properties of some mutations prevalent among Israeli populations, 
the normal human glucocerebrosidase cDNA and cDNAs carrying mutations N370S, 
L444P, D409H, recTL, recNcil, P415R and 84GG were coupled to the T7 RNA 
polymerase promoter in a vaccinia virus-derived expression vector (pTM-1). 
Recombinant viruses were produced and used to infect human tissue culture cells. 
RNA and protein stability, recognition by anti-glucocerebrosidase monoclonal 
antibodies and intracellular enzymatic activity were measured. The results 
demonstrated that the D409H allele directed synthesis of cytoplasmic RNA with 
decreased stability compared with its normal counterpart or other mutated forms. 
The D409H and L444P mutated proteins had lower stability than that of their 
normal counterpart, while the recNcil-mutated protein was more stable. Only 
glucocerebrosidase forms harboring leucine at position 444 were recognized by 
the anti-glucocerebrosidase monoclonal antibodies used (8E4 and 2C7). 
Measurements of enzymatic activity of the recombinant proteins in cells loaded 
with a fluorescent glucosylceramide demonstrated that the N370S mutated enzyme 
had activity similar to that of the normal enzyme. The other mutated enzymes 
exhibited varying degrees of activities, generally corresponding to the 
phenotypes with which they are associated. The results presented demonstrate the 
use of the vaccinia virus-derived expression system and of loading living cells 
with fluorescent substrate as efficient tools for studying mutants in Gaucher 
disease and in other lysosomal diseases."
9177303,"DNA sequence analysis of the gene encoding subunit 6 of the 
NADH-ubiquinone-oxidoreductase complex (ND6) in human mitochondria was performed 
in 25 independent patients who suffer from Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy 
(LHON). In 10 cases the well-known LHON mutation at nucleotide position (np) 
14484 was detected. Furthermore, silent substitutions at np14167 and np14527 and 
missense mutations at np14498, np14564, np14568, and np14582 were found in 
individual patients. The np14498 and np14568 mutations were found in patients 
who present a typical clinical picture and course of LHON but lack any of the 
canonical mtDNA mutations. The np14568 mutation, which replaces a moderately 
conserved glycine by a serine residue, was observed in a single male patient and 
subsequently excluded in 175 independent controls. The mutation at np14498, 
which replaces an evolutionarily highly conserved tyrosine with a cysteine, was 
found in a multigeneration family with four affected members, the eldest 
carrying a heteroplasmic mixture of mutated and wildtype mtDNA molecules. None 
of 170 analyzed control subjects carried this mutation. These findings provide 
evidence that several allelic ND6 gene mutations may be involved in Lebers 
hereditary optic neuropathy."
9177348,"Development of the vertebrate eye requires a series of steps including 
specification of the anterior neural plate, evagination of the optic vesicles 
from the ventral forebrain, and the cellular differentiation of the lens and 
retina. Homeobox-containing genes, especially the transcription regulator Pax6, 
play a critical role in vertebrate and invertebrate eye formation. Mutations in 
Pax6 function result in eye malformations known as Aniridia in humans and Small 
eye syndrome in mice. The Drosophila homologue of Pax6, eyeless, is also 
necessary for correct invertebrate eye development, and its misexpression leads 
to formation of ectopic eyes in Drosophila. Here we show that a conserved 
vertebrate homeobox gene, Rx, is essential for normal eye development, and that 
its misexpression has profound effects on eye morphology. Xenopus embryos 
injected with synthetic Rx RNA develop ectopic retinal tissue and display 
hyperproliferation in the neuroretina. Mouse embryos carrying a null allele of 
this gene do not form optic cups and so do not develop eyes. The Rx gene family 
plays an important role in the establishment and/or proliferation of retinal 
progenitor cells."
9177584,"Physical activity is an important aspect of health behavior and life-style, when 
considering the possibilities to prevent premature deaths and sustain functional 
capacity. We studied former Finnish male athletes and controls to investigate 
the effects of long-lasting participation in vigorous sports on health, and the 
main findings are reviewed here. The athletes represented Finland between the 
years 1920-1965 at least once in international competitions. The following 
sports were selected: track and field athletics, cross-country skiing, soccer, 
ice hockey, basketball, boxing, wrestling, weight lifting, and shooting. The 
full name, place and date of birth were traced for 2613 (97.7%) men. The 
referent subjects (N = 1712) were selected among those Finnish men who, at the 
age of 20, were classified completely healthy at the medical examination for 
induction into military service. In most analyses we grouped the sports 
according to the type of training needed to achieve maximal results, i.e., 
principally aerobic training, principally anaerobic training or mixed. In 1985, 
a questionnaire on physical activity, health and health habits was mailed to 
surviving former athletes and referents (N = 2851, 65.9% of the original 
cohort). Follow-up for morbidity and mortality was based on national medical 
registries. We found that former aerobic sports athletes (endurance and mixed 
sports) in particular have high total and active life expectancy and low risk 
for ischemic heart disease and diabetes in later years. On the other hand, they 
have slightly higher risk for lower-limb osteoarthritis. Overall, the benefits 
of physically active life-style on health were clearly higher than the adverse 
effects."
9177778,"Genome mapping in the dog is in its early stages. Here we illustrate an approach 
to combined physical and linkage mapping of type 1 anchor (gene) loci in the dog 
using information on syntenic homology from human and mouse, an interbreed 
cross/backcross, and a strategy for isolation of dog genomic clones containing 
both gene-specific sequences and simple sequence repeat polymorphisms. Eleven 
gene loci from human chromosome 17q (HSA17q) were mapped to the centromeric 
two-thirds of dog chromosome 9 (CFA9), an acrocentric chromosome of medium size: 
P4HB, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, BRCA1, RARA, THRA1, MPO, NF1, and CRYBA1. Eight of 
these were also positioned on a linkage map spanning 38.6 cM. Based on combined 
fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 
is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 
(MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the 
centromere. Canine loci, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, THRA1, and RARA constitute a 
closely linked group near the centromeric end of CFA9, spanning a genetic 
distance of only 4.7 cM. Canine NF1 and CRYBA1 lie distally, near the lower 
border of the Giemsa band adjacent to the distal one-third of CFA9. NF1 and 
CRYBA1 are loosely linked to the more centromeric group (31.2 cM). No HSA17 
genes were found on the telomeric one-third of CFA9. Painting of dog chromosomes 
with a human whole chromosome 17 probe showed hybridization with only the 
proximal two-thirds of CFA9, consistent with the conclusion that the distal 
one-third corresponds to a segment or segments of other human chromosomes. Two 
loci, GLUT4 and PMP22, located on HSA17p, were mapped by FISH to dog chromosome 
5 in a region also identified by the whole human chromosome 17 paint, indicating 
disruption of HSA17 syntenic homology at the centromere."
9178888,"We previously isolated and characterized a coding region determinant-binding 
protein (CRD-BP) that might regulate c-myc mRNA post-transcriptionally. CRD-BP 
binds specifically to the coding region of c-myc mRNA and might stabilize c-myc 
mRNA in vitro by protecting it from endonucleolytic cleavage. Since c-myc 
abundance is regulated during embryonic development and cell replication, we 
investigated whether CRD-BP is also regulated in animal tissues. We focused on 
CRD-BP expression during rat liver development and liver regeneration, because 
c-myc mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally in both cases. CRD-BP expression 
parallels c-myc expression during liver development; the protein is present in 
fetal and neonatal liver but is absent or in low abundance in adult liver. In 
contrast, the up-regulation of c-myc mRNA following partial hepatectomy is not 
accompanied by up-regulation of CRD-BP. To our knowledge, CRD-BP is the first 
example of a putative mammalian mRNA-binding protein that is abundant in a fetal 
tissue but either absent from or scarce in adult tissues. Its expression in 
fetal liver and in transformed cell lines suggests CRD-BP is an oncofetal 
protein."
9181534,"Young adulthood is notable for rapid physical changes and psychosocial 
instability. Care of the young adult professional voice requires knowledge of 
the specific anatomic and physiologic changes associated with the mutational 
voice, as well as the effects of general growth and maturation on the vocal 
mechanism. The effects of psychological stresses common to young adulthood, such 
as educational commitments and early career choices, must also be understood. 
Upper respiratory infection and allergies are common in this age group. 
Treatment of these conditions must be tailored in the professional voice user 
because of the potential side effects of some medications and the performance 
imperatives of the patient. Surgical indications for tonsillectomy in the young 
voice patient are discussed. There are no special considerations in the 
evaluation and treatment of laryngeal pathology in the young adult, with the 
exception of limiting the use of sedative anesthesia. However, conservatism in 
surgical decision-making is advised. The development of a stable, efficient 
vocal technique and a mature professional background requires time, patience, 
and hard work."
9182523,"Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly 
inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through 
intramembrane interactions. Here, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the PLN 
transmembrane sequence was used to identify two functional domains on opposite 
faces of the transmembrane helix. Mutations in one face diminish inhibitory 
interactions with transmembrane sequences of SERCA2a, but have relatively little 
effect on the pentameric state, while mutations in the other face activate 
inhibitory interactions and enhance monomer formation. Double mutants are 
monomeric, but loss of inhibitory function is dominant over activation of 
inhibitory function. These observations support the proposal that the SERCA2a 
interaction site lies on the helical face which is not involved in pentamer 
formation. Four highly inhibitory mutants are effectively devoid of pentamer, 
suggesting that pentameric PLN represents a less active or inactive reservoir 
that dissociates to provide inhibitory monomeric PLN subunits. A model is 
presented in which the degree of PLN inhibition of SERCA2a activity is 
ultimately determined by the concentration of the inhibited PLN monomer.SERCA2a 
heterodimeric complex. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined 
by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) 
and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is 
likely to be mutation-sensitive)."
9182663,"To understand how cells differentially use the dozens of myosin isozymes present 
in each genome, we examined the distribution of four unconventional myosin 
isozymes in the inner ear, a tissue that is particularly reliant on actin-rich 
structures and unconventional myosin isozymes. Of the four isozymes, each from a 
different class, three are expressed in the hair cells of amphibia and mammals. 
In stereocilia, constructed of cross-linked F-actin filaments, myosin-Ibeta is 
found mostly near stereociliary tips, myosin-VI is largely absent, and 
myosin-VIIa colocalizes with crosslinks that connect adjacent stereocilia. In 
the cuticular plate, a meshwork of actin filaments, myosin-Ibeta is excluded, 
myosin-VI is concentrated, and modest amounts of myosin-VIIa are present. These 
three myosin isozymes are excluded from other actin-rich domains, including the 
circumferential actin belt and the cortical actin network. A member of a fourth 
class, myosin-V, is not expressed in hair cells but is present at high levels in 
afferent nerve cells that innervate hair cells. Substantial amounts of 
myosins-Ibeta, -VI, and -VIIa are located in a pericuticular necklace that is 
largely free of F-actin, squeezed between (but not associated with) actin of the 
cuticular plate and the circumferential belt. Our localization results suggest 
specific functions for three hair-cell myosin isozymes. As suggested previously, 
myosin-Ibeta probably plays a role in adaptation; concentration of myosin-VI in 
cuticular plates and association with stereociliary rootlets suggest that this 
isozyme participates in rigidly anchoring stereocilia; and finally, 
colocalization with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia indicates that 
myosin-VIIa is required for the structural integrity of hair bundles."
9184597,"PURPOSE: Before 1986, the spectrum of childhood epilepsies, including 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Doose syndrome (DS), known collectively as 
""epilepsia myoclonica astatica,"" was believed to represent a single disease. 
More recently, some investigators have considered these syndromes to be parts of 
a continuum. To clarify these theories, neurobiologic factors of the syndromes 
were studied to determine which qualities were shared and which were unique.
METHODS: A retrospective (1975-1985), community-based (Helsinki metropolitan 
area and the province of Uusimaa) study was designed to seek children with 
features of LGS and DS. It was assumed that recall bias and the selection of 
documented history would be similar throughout the group. Ranks of increasing 
pathology were assigned to different seizure types, EEG results, and drug 
treatments. A similar procedure was applied to epidemiologic data. Spearman 
rank-order correlations were calculated to determine which features correlated 
with LGS and which correlated with less severe epilepsy.
RESULTS: The survey comprised 75 patients with broadly defined LGS. The annual 
incidence was 2 in 100,000 children aged 0 to 14 years. Prenatal or perinatal 
abnormalities did not correlate with severity of epilepsy. As compared with the 
relatively favorable ranks, the severe epilepsy ranks were more often associated 
with an early onset of epilepsy, an infectious disease at the onset, delayed 
development before epilepsy, abnormalities in neurologic or neuroradiologic 
examinations, and a deteriorating course of the condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LGS are more likely than patients with less severe 
epilepsy to have a younger age at onset of epilepsy, an infection or both, and a 
deteriorating course of the condition."
9184851,"The rate of proteolysis is an important determinant of the intracellular protein 
content. Part of the degradation of intracellular proteins occurs in the 
lysosomes and is mediated by macroautophagy. In liver, macroautophagy is very 
active and almost completely accounts for starvation-induced proteolysis. 
Factors inhibiting this process include amino acids, cell swelling and insulin. 
In the mechanisms controlling macroautophagy, protein phosphorylation plays an 
important role. Activation of a signal transduction pathway, ultimately leading 
to phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, accompanies inhibition of 
macroautophagy. Components of this pathway may include a heterotrimeric 
Gi3-protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase. Recent evidence 
indicates that lysosomal protein degradation can be selective and occurs via 
ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways."
9187679,"Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease with a high 
prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population but it is also present in other 
populations. The presence of eight mutations (1226G, 1448C, IVS2+1. 84GG, 1504T, 
1604T, 1342C and 1297T) and the complete deletion of the beta-glucocerebrosidase 
gene was investigated in 25 unrelated non-Jewish patients with Gaucher's disease 
in Germany. In the Jewish population, three of these mutations account for more 
than 90% of all mutated alleles. In addition, relatives of two patients were 
included in our study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and 
sequencing of PCR products obtained from DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was 
performed for mutation analysis. Gene deletion was detected by comparison of 
radioactively labelled PCR fragments of both the functional 
beta-glucocerebrosidase gene and the pseudogene. Among the unrelated patients, 
50 alleles were investigated and the mutations identified in 35 alleles (70%), 
whereas 15 alleles (30%) remained unidentified. The most prevalent mutation in 
our group of patients was the 1226G (370Asn-->Ser) mutation, accounting for 18 
alleles (36%), followed by the 1448C (444Lcu-->Pro) mutation, that was found in 
12 alleles (24%). A complete gene deletion was present in two alleles (4%). The 
IVS1+2 (splicing mutation), the 1504T (463Arg-->Cys) as well as the 1342C 
(409Asp-->His) mutations were each present in one allele (2%). None of the 
alleles carried the 84GG (frame-shift), 1604A (496Arg-->His) or the 1297T 
(394Val-->Leu) mutation. This distribution is different from the Ashkenazi 
Jewish population but is similar to other Caucasian groups like the Spanish and 
Portuguese populations. Our results confirm the variability of mutation patterns 
in Gaucher patients of different ethnic origin. All patients were divided into 
nine groups according to their genotype and their clinical status was related to 
the individual genotype. Genotype/phenotype characteristics of the 1226G, 1448C, 
and 1342C mutations of previous studies were confirmed by our results."
9190537,"Two forms of neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) are connected with 
genes localized on chromosomes 17 and 22, respectively. The genes that are 
inactivated in neurofibromatosis code for the proteins neurofibromine and 
merline, respectively. Since inactivation leads to neoplasia, they are called 
tumour suppressor genes. Neurofibromine shows resemblances to proteins that 
serve to inactivate oncogenes. Merline has a relationship with proteins that 
connect the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. The precise function of the 
proteins is still unknown. The NF1 gene is characterized by extraordinarily high 
sensitivity to mutation; half the NF1 patients have not inherited the disease. 
In the familial form of neurofibromatosis, a mutated gene is inherited and the 
normal allele in the tumour is inactivated, making tumour growth possible. In 
the sporadic form of neurofibromatosis, both normal alleles are inactivated 
locally in the tissue so that a tumour develops in that place."

aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide 
relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same 
genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the 
frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide 
XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary 
sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] 
as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] 
vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the 
differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide 
biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is 
underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and 
M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly 
underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in 
Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial 
genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The 
M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of 
CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the 
genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites 
distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between 
bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of 
differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not 
form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative 
sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. 
jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the 
difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses 
center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and 
dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible 
mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome 
compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of 
molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative 
eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early 
evolution of eukaryotes."
9192868,"The approximately 300 distinct neurons comprising each hemineuromere of the 
Drosophila embryonic central nervous system are derived from a segmentally 
reiterated array of approximately 30 progenitor cells, neuroblasts (NBs). Each 
NB has a unique identity and undergoes repeated cell divisions to produce 
several smaller secondary precursor cells, ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each 
GMC divides once to produce two neurons and/or glia, thereby generating a 
specific lineage of neurons/glia. Understanding the generation of neuronal 
diversity requires not only elucidation of the molecules and mechanisms that 
specify NB identity but also those that act to differentiate between the cell 
types produced within one NB lineage. Here we show that the Drosophila Zn finger 
protein Klumpfuss (Klu), which shows sequence similarities to the mammalian 
Wilm's tumor suppressor (WT-1), acts to differentiate between the identities of 
the first two secondary precursor cells produced from one NB lineage. Klu is 
expressed in the NB4-2 lineage only after two rounds of NB cell division, in the 
second born GMC (GMC4-2b). In loss-of-function mutant embryos, the first born 
GMC (GMC4-2a) as well as its progeny neurons are duplicated; we show that this 
duplication of the GMC4-2a sublineage arises because GMC4-2b adopts the identity 
of GMC4-2a and divides to produce the GMC4-2a progeny. Moreover, when Klu is 
ectopically expressed in GMC4-2a, it fails to acquire its normal identity and 
fails to produce correctly specified progeny. klu therefore acts to specify the 
identity of GMC4-2b and to make it distinct from GMC4-2a. Our findings further 
suggest that the determination of GMC cell fate occurs in two steps; the initial 
GMC identity is the consequence of inheritance from the maternal NB, however, 
the subsequent stabilization of this identity requires functions like klu in the 
GMC."
